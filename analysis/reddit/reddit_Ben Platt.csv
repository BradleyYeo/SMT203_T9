1,2020-02-03 01:39:26,exxeip,"I saw Phantom about ten years ago and we had an understudy for the Phantom who I guess decided that this was his goddamn time to shine.  He was very talented, but dear Lord, he hammed it up so hard for every single scene he was in. 

&#x200B;

The example that sticks out the most is after he drops the chandelier and laughs manically to close up the first act, he was still laughing when the lights came up and the usher near us was super confused about what was happening."
2,2020-02-03 00:34:19,exxeip,"I saw a standby for Lafayette/Jefferson in Hamilton once who I really did not enjoy.  His accent as Lafayette was really bad and he put on some really weird voice for Jefferson that was high pitched and just painful to listen to.  I literally cringed every time he came on the stage.  I saw the same actor as Hamilton like six months later and actually thought he was fine in that role so maybe he was having a really off day when I saw him the first time, or he just made some weird acting choices that I didn't appreciate.  I think that is the only time I have ever been disappointed by an understudy and I have seen quite a few."

4,2020-02-03 03:19:56,exxeip,"I saw David Hasselhoff as Dr. Jeckyll/Mr. Hyde on Broadway. I don't know if elaboration is necessary, you can come to your own conclusions (or just look it up on YouTube)."
5,2020-02-03 01:43:28,exxeip,We had the understudy for Elphaba in LA years ago and she did NOT have the low note in I’m Not That Girl. She growled out something without any pitch and I about came out of my chair. It was awful.
6,2020-02-03 02:06:49,exxeip,"I saw Betty Buckley in the *Dolly* tour three weeks before her contract ended. The show was snappy and everyone seemed in top shape, except for Buckley who was underwhelming and looked, frankly, tired. And she really tried to milk laughs and applause by repeating gestures and bits three of four times until someone finally laughed or clapped, which to me is a real sign of desperation.  Maybe it was just an off day, or maybe she was struggling at the end of the tour, or maybe she was ill. I say that because I know that is not her usual performing standard. I brought my 85 year old mother and even she remarked on it."
7,2020-02-03 00:25:48,exxeip,Josh Grisetti as Mark in the off-Broadway revival of RENT. Absolutely the worst performance I’ve ever seen from a professional. Although Adam Pascal in the 15th anniversary tour was almost as bad.
8,2020-02-03 10:39:53,exxeip,"The acting in the touring show of Anastasia was so wooden and then hugely over dramatic, it was terrible."
9,2020-02-03 07:51:46,exxeip,"Daphne Rubin-Vega as Fantine was so bad that I wept for joy when she finally died. However, knowing she’d be back for the finale haunted me for the rest of the show."
10,2020-02-03 09:26:38,exxeip,"Can we talk about the US Tour of Matilda in 2015 & how terrible all of the children were in it??

Also one time in 2006 (I was 14) I talked shit on MySpace about a touring Maureen in a Rent tour and she called me out on it hahahah “we see what you write online” ok Scary McScowell the only reason I’m also asking you for your signature on my Playbill is so I have a completely signed one just sign it and move on"
11,2020-02-03 14:56:12,exxeip,"The Laura Osnes/ Stephen Pasquale production of Carousel in Chicago had an understudy for Stephen one day. The stage manager come over the god mic and told the audience “Stephen won’t be going on because he was under the weather”. Then announced the understudy was ALSO under the weather. 

I don’t think the understudy was under the weather at all, I think he was just not good."
12,2020-02-03 00:47:31,exxeip,The person playing Dawn when I went to see Waitress in London was absolutely shocking. Really poor singing. It was my first time seeing the show and it really took away from an incredibly moving story
13,2020-02-03 03:30:09,exxeip,"I wasn’t a fan of NaTasha Yvette Williams in Waitress. She just seemed to shout every single line. EVERY. SINGLE. LINE.

Completely took me out of the show every time that she was on stage because it felt like I was watching a parody of the character.

*However* I know that this is just my opinion."
14,2020-02-03 04:32:56,exxeip,"Beauty and the Beast is my SO's favorite musical so a few years ago I surprised him with tickets and we saw it at the Hippodrome in Baltimore. 

We laugh about it now, but when it was over I was convinced that my SO was going to break up with me for taking him to that show. The Beast was having some kind of a day because the singing was *so* off. You could tell that he wasn't on his cues and the orchestra was making adjustments for his performances, which let to some really weird music happening and the other actors over compensating. He wasn't an understudy either! It was so confusing. At one point he ended a song with a rise to his voice (idk what its called, sorry) to his voice, so the audience didn't know that the song had ended and thought there was another verse. We all just kind of awkwardly...sat there. While there was a deliberate pause for applause that didn't happen. 

 For ""If I Can't Have Her"", he sang it in a higher key than its meant to be - which, fine, but it was also a higher voice than he had been singing in for the rest of the musical. So it was like he thought 'I bet this will be funny!' and decided to mock the show by singing in Belle's voice instead. 

After the show, the woman sitting next to me wondered if he might have been drunk. I haven't returned to the Hippodrome because of that show, even though I used to be there multiple times a season."
15,2020-02-03 16:00:38,exxeip,"Other than specific performances (anyone can have an off day), why do generally untalented/unsuitable people get cast? Like if they can't sing, can't dance, or just don't fit the part, why are they cast in the first place?"
16,2020-02-03 01:31:44,exxeip,"I saw a touring production of The Little Mermaid a few years back and the girl playing Ariel had such a weak singing voice I couldn't understand her (meanwhile Ursula's mic went out and I could still hear her just fine). Other than that, I can't really think of any that were bad enough to be memorable."
17,2020-02-03 01:37:04,exxeip,I still remember (because of how shockingly miscast he was) seeing Jamie Farr as Nathan Detroit in Guys and Dolls (after having seen Nathan Lane).  Not a wise choice there.
18,2020-02-03 01:20:40,exxeip,"Only child actors really, especially if they have to put on an accent.  But I suppose they can be forgiven for that..."
19,2020-02-03 15:19:54,exxeip,"Lacreta as Gary Coleman in Avenue Q a few weeks before closing. She practically spoke through her songs and in general didn't seem like she wanted to be there.

Not sure the actors names, but we saw understudies for the young Simba and Nala in the Lion King a few years ago. They were...not that good."
20,2020-02-03 02:00:16,exxeip,"Several years ago I saw a performance of Chicago on their national tour and I was shocked. Christie Brinkley played Roxy and I’m not joking when I say that my 16 year old theater kid ass could have played Roxy 100x better. I understood it was a dance show, and it’s not like the original broadway soundtrack is particularly easy on the ears, but it was AWFUL. Singing, acting, and dancing were like it was her first time ever. I came away from the performance so unbelievably disappointed."
21,2020-02-03 04:14:07,exxeip,I’ve seen cats many times and was seeing the opening night of the tour last year in LA at the pantages and it was honestly a bad performance. The singing was off for a lot of the performers but most disappointing was the dancing was also off and some were getting the choreography wrong which led to them falling. I felt bad watching it but it was genuinely a bad performance from almost the entire cast.
22,2020-02-03 05:44:46,exxeip,"Drew Lachey as Mark in Rent. It really soured me on the show as a whole (was my first and only time seeing it) and I wonder if seeing it with a better lead would have changed my opinion of the show. As far as stunt casting goes, at least he had signing experience from being in a boy band, but his acting was just awful and made me hate not only his character but everyone around him."
23,2020-02-03 02:47:14,exxeip,I....honestly did not like Jessie as Eurydice in Hadestown. Eva puts so much heart into that role and her and Reeve’s chemistry is palpable. Jessie felt a little forced to me and I didn’t really love her singing.
24,2020-02-03 15:21:04,exxeip,[deleted]
25,2020-02-04 01:59:58,exxeip,Taye Diggs as Hedwig. What a disaster! He in no way embodied the character - not sure he even remotely understood the text. And he couldn't remember many of the lines and lyrics. Stunt casting at its worst.
26,2020-02-04 20:50:06,exxeip,"I saw Cody Simpson in Anastasia and while his acting was satisfactory, his singing was lacking. On the West End, I saw True West and that was an experience. It was the first play I had ever seen and is still the worst play I've ever seen. I think the acting was good but the show was such a shitshow I can't tell."
27,2020-02-03 08:36:18,exxeip,"Tim Hughes as Hades in Hadestown. Laughably bad. Had no commanding presence (in spite of his size), was nervous, did not have a great singing voice. I lol’ed anytime he had a scene with Eva because she’s such bad bitch, and Tim’s Hades would never seduce her to the underworld like Patrick’s. Every time he was on stage, I was immediately taken out of the world because of how bad I thought he was. Oof."
28,2020-02-03 08:11:17,exxeip,"Did you have Sam as well for DEH? I had a similar thing happen, but we pushed it onto it being the final preview and nerves"
29,2020-02-04 16:15:42,exxeip,"I thought Lila Coogan's performance in the touring Anastasia was poor and her lack of acting took away from the show as a whole. The only time I enjoyed it was during scenes where she wasn't present. I mentioned in another comment but it doesn't help that the show's script is all over the place, so even a great actor would have a hard time making it work, but she didn't do it any favors.

I've seen Wicked a few times on tour and only once was it bad. It was in 2011 or so and for some reason they were effectively speed-running the show. Most of the actors were saying their dialogue quickly, without much emotion, and speeding up the songs, and I wasn't only the one to notice. It was so strange. I've never heard ""For Good"" sung by the characters so fast and without any sort of connection. I don't know if something was going on backstage or they'd been told they needed to finish by a certain time (It wasn't the last night in the tour or anything, middle of the run) but oof."
30,2020-02-05 01:34:29,exxeip,I want to read this thread with great interest and remember it any time I'm psyching myself out of an audition.
31,2020-02-03 13:40:54,exxeip,"Peppermint in Head Over Heels. My god. Can’t sing, can’t act. She was miserable in that role.

People were too afraid to criticize or admit just how bad she was because it was such a groundbreaking moment for trans people."
32,2020-02-08 05:04:52,exxeip,"YESSSS

I saw the Phantom tour in SF. Mind you I've seen it 3 times before this - once in Vegas and twice in other tours, Anyway, the most recent tour:

\- There was no chemistry between actors (especially Phantom and Christine)

\- Phantom's actor's voice didn't fit

\- Actress playing Christine looked super overwhelmed at headlining a musical

\- When the Phantom makes the chandelier drop at the end of the first act (a change I also hate in the musical, but book it makes more sense... I digress.) When he made the chandelier drop HE SAID BOOM.

I will repeat that - HE SAID BOOM. WHY.

The special effects were weak as hell.

I left at intermission. I have NEVER left a show ever. I've been to shows I don't really like, but I want to see how they end. Not this one, I knew how it ended and I was out of there.

I sent an email complaining. It was so bad."
33,2020-02-03 23:06:28,exxeip,"I'm not going to name names, partially because I don't remember and don't want to look it up, but I saw the les mis tour recently (my 5th time seeing the show) and had a Fantine understudy that unfortunately didn't perform very well. All of the big notes in I Dreamed a Dream were very noticeably flat. Maybe she was ill or having a bad day. That's probably the only really ""bad"" performance I've ever seen. I've seen choices that weren't to my taste but nothing truly poor."
34,2020-02-16 14:39:26,exxeip,"When I saw Hamilton for the first time I got the understudy of the understudy for Burr and he did not have the range...which would be fine if he was the guy singing ""Farmer Refuted"" but Burr is the narrator and has one of the biggest showstoppers. It felt so flat and he was outsung by everyone else.

Yesterday my son and I saw Spongebob for the second time and Lorenzo's understudy did not seem to understand the character he was playing. I said Lorzeno's Spongebob voice may have been too high (just a little) but this guy didn't do the voice AT ALL except for a few moments where he went super high.

It's very bizarre watching a guy who's supposed to play a character KNOWN for his high voice and watch him talk and sing so deeply. 

And the thing is, it's a joke in the show that Spongebob's voice gets deeper when he's earnest (Squidward cuts him off and he shouts, ""I'M NOT FINISHED!"") so it was more than a little strange"
35,2020-02-04 13:31:10,exxeip,Glenn Close in Mother Of The Maid. So hammy. Also that reality TV celeb in Head Over Heels. Couldn't act or sing and just kept striking awkward poses instead
36,2020-02-03 00:53:18,exxeip,"I didn’t see it in person (saw a bootleg), but Giles Terrera, playing Aaron Burr in hamilton, was truly awful. You can see a little bit of that horror in the olivier performance of hamilton a few years ago. truly awful"
37,2020-02-03 10:15:37,exxeip,The actor who played Link in Hairspray Live is openly gay and he was pretty awkward looking as a straight casanova
38,2020-02-03 00:16:37,exxeip,I saw him....um.....
39,2020-02-03 02:59:26,exxeip,"Saw Cameron Dallas a couple days ago in Mean Girls. Can confirm, his singing was rough!"
40,2020-02-03 00:34:10,exxeip,Woof Cameron Dallas. At least he’s hot
41,2020-02-03 03:43:50,exxeip,"I had bunch of understudies when I went to see Phantom a month ago, including for Raoul, and Raoul’s actor’s singing was okay, but the way he pronounced his consonants made it hard to hear what he was actually singing. I don’t know if the microphone he was using was faulty or what, but all I heard were consonants at certain points."
42,2020-02-03 16:10:06,exxeip,"That’s actually common, Michael Crawford used to laugh past when the lights came back on, Robert Guillaume too."
43,2020-02-03 14:24:08,exxeip,"I saw it before they redid like half the plot, no one believes me when I tell them about the shoes song. That show was at least an entertaining train wreck. Especially when Green Goblin got stuck swinging around the balcony at the end of the first act."
44,2020-02-03 05:26:14,exxeip,Hey! I lived off that VHS recording in middle school. Lol. I wonder if I would love it as much if I were introduced to it today.
45,2020-02-03 09:29:18,exxeip,I watch the Confrontation on YouTube every time I need a good laugh.
46,2020-02-03 09:34:30,exxeip,Jemma Rix from the Australian cast didn’t always go for the low note. Sometimes went for a higher note.
47,2020-02-03 04:03:35,exxeip,What was wrong with Adam Pascal in that tour? That sounds interesting!!
48,2020-02-04 00:52:01,exxeip,Oh no I’m seeing this at the end of the month. Wish me luck LOL.
49,2020-02-04 08:46:18,exxeip,Anyone specifically? I just saw it and wasn’t particularly impressed and couldn’t figure out why. I really liked the ‘once upon a December’ sequence so I told myself it was worth it lol.
50,2020-02-05 02:57:19,exxeip,"Wow.  I wonder if we saw different casts.  When I saw it, it was the best show I'd seen since Come From Away.  My only complaint was that one of the leading men got very very stiff whoever he was singing.  It was really off-putting.

Or maybe I'm looking at the past through rosy glasses since I just saw Escape To Margaritaville and it was so awful I almost walked out at intermission."
51,2020-02-03 09:32:35,exxeip,"Drawing your attention to this gem, in case you haven’t already seen it. Hope it doesn’t trigger flashbacks. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZY1kK2-lg4"
52,2020-02-03 09:35:56,exxeip,"> Can we talk about

Sure we can!"
53,2020-02-03 23:00:04,exxeip,"I agree. I saw her twice and both times I just wanted a bit more range of dynamics. I saw hints of it, but most of the performance was more shouting than singing."
54,2020-02-03 16:14:14,exxeip,"In the case of stunt casting, they usually cast a celeb to save a dying show and bring in ticket sales. As for professionals being cast in positions that aren’t right for them then, who knows? Could be anything from subjectivity to nepotism."
55,2020-02-03 09:31:21,exxeip,Saw the lion king recently and the child Simba wasn’t great. Couldn’t be helped cause he’s only a kid but it did mean Mufasa’s death didn’t have much of an impact.
56,2020-02-04 23:35:53,exxeip,"Lacretta posted on Instagram around that time about how she didn't like playing the role because it was hard to laugh about how everyone's a little bit racist these days and she felt like a tragic clown as Gary Coleman. So, not surprised that she wasn't giving the most enthusiastic performance!"
57,2020-02-03 06:59:08,exxeip,"I saw him as Mark too! Really rough. Rest of the show was great, though."
58,2020-02-03 04:06:40,exxeip,Have an upvote for having an opinion
59,2020-02-04 00:24:26,exxeip,"I just feel like Jessie's voice isn't suited at all for Eurydice.  She was amazing as a Fate which also makes sense she covers the Fates since she was one in the Off-Broadway production.  

When I saw Jessie covering Yvette, I actually preferred her sound with Kay and Jewelle."
60,2020-02-03 16:13:11,exxeip,Pretty good. They dipped out of them a couple of times but for the most part it was believable even when signing.
61,2020-02-03 13:32:22,exxeip,That's too bad. Haven't seen his Hades but I really like him as an ensemble member.
62,2020-02-03 14:31:26,exxeip,"I am so sad to hear this, I was hoping I could get to see him go on, too."
63,2020-02-03 08:36:23,exxeip,[removed]
64,2020-02-03 09:35:55,exxeip,No the understudy David Breeds. I thought it could be nerves too but checked and he’s been in multiple times before.  Was Sam Tutty also having problems when you saw it?
65,2020-02-04 16:54:51,exxeip,Did you ask for your money back with Wicked? I would have been livid.
66,2020-02-04 04:50:17,exxeip,"Really? See I quite enjoyed her in the role. What she lacked in singing abilities, she made up for in stage prescience and comic timing."
67,2020-02-03 09:34:38,exxeip,I saw Giles Terrera as Burr. I didn’t find him bad but his voice is definitely an acquired taste. He did lowkey sound like Kermit the Frog on some notes. I was so excited to be there and the cast is so large that I didn’t care 😂
68,2020-02-03 13:39:36,exxeip,Ehh I mean maybe. But make sure this isn’t your own unconscious prejudice against gay men playing straight roles.
69,2020-02-03 09:40:55,exxeip,Not related to his acting ability but did he look kinda weird opposite Erika. She’s a wonderful actress but I feel she looks a good few years older then him?
70,2020-02-03 00:46:23,exxeip,Plenty of other hot guys in the world who can sing though.
71,2020-02-03 01:10:34,exxeip,"See, this kind of thinking is half the problem."
72,2020-02-03 10:42:39,exxeip,"I think she usually stuck with the high note - she did every time I saw her. I'd much rather that than a choked-out low note, and she's so phenomenal in the role, I'll definitely take it."
73,2020-02-03 15:50:06,exxeip,I don’t know what this woman’s name was. It was back when Megan Hilty was still in LA but she was there forever. My main grievance at time was that she didn’t just take it up.
74,2020-02-03 04:22:46,exxeip,TL;DR: Vocally unimpressive and way too old for the role.
75,2020-02-04 00:59:56,exxeip,I super hope my experience was a one-off! It was an opening night so who knows!
76,2020-02-04 10:19:48,exxeip,I don't want to name anyone specific. I can't imagine spending your whole life chasing a Broadway dream and beating the odds to get a big role on a national tour....just to read in a forum that some secretary from BFE hated you in your dream.
77,2020-02-04 16:04:31,exxeip,"I'll be blunt and say I thought Lila Coogan as Anya was genuinely bad at acting to the point that it made the show unenjoyable. Every time she was interacting with another person she had this blank look on her face like she was waiting for them to stop talking so she could say her lines, rather than actually reacting to what was happening on stage. It was bizarre. 

It doesn't help that the show's writing is all over the place, which makes it hard for even a great actor to do well, so combined with her lackluster performance... anytime she was on stage things fell flat for me.

At least the costumes were gorgeous."
78,2020-02-03 10:03:14,exxeip,"I feel bad talking shit about children, because they’re children, but seriously the one thing that I can remember from this terrible show that I genuinely disliked was how annoying the Matilda was saying “I’m a GIRL” six or a million times throughout the script. All of their accents were terrible and so distracting."
79,2020-02-03 16:18:05,exxeip,I've always suspected the latter in cases where the person is *objectively* bad. That or someone owes someone a favor (the likely basis of the entire show *Gary: A Sequel to Titus Andronicus* haha).
80,2020-02-03 16:04:55,exxeip,I saw it in December with a large group and agreed. Really not great.
81,2020-02-03 14:25:02,exxeip,Agreed. He has such an amazing presence as an ensemble member. It's really sad that didn't translate as Hades.
82,2020-02-03 13:31:25,exxeip,bad bot
83,2020-02-03 09:41:10,exxeip,"I find that interesting- I preferred David over Sam (though just barely) the second time I saw it. 

Sam was missing a few notes, especially in Waving and If I Could Tell Her. But you wouldn't noticed unless you've worshipped the OBC recording- my sister didn't notice

Both were and are phenomenal"
84,2020-02-04 17:16:00,exxeip,"No, I didn't even think about it. In retrospect I wish I'd gotten a group of people to go to the box office to say something, it was such a weird experience."
85,2020-02-04 17:42:36,exxeip,"I'm not sure what you mean by stage presence. She looked great, if that was what you are referring to. 

But her singing was terrible and her acting was terrible. It was clearly stunt casting because, generally, singing and dancing are sort of important for a broadway performer."
86,2020-02-03 13:45:01,exxeip,"I remember watching, I think the issue was he didn’t have any chemistry with the actress playing Tracey, regardless of his sexuality."
87,2020-02-03 04:33:04,exxeip,"I know and fully agree that it wasn’t a good performance (saw it just a few weeks ago for my first Bway trip), and I’m certainly not saying he has any place on Broadway, but I can acknowledge he’s good looking. Not sure what the huge deal is with the downvotes."
88,2020-02-03 11:06:22,exxeip,"Oh she did both solidly. It was definitely a case of the high note being used more consistently in the second tour.

She was my first Elphaba, way back when it was in previews in 2008 in a Melbourne. Seems so long ago now..."
89,2020-02-03 22:59:17,exxeip,Eden Espinosa?
90,2020-02-03 04:23:56,exxeip,That makes sense... same issue as the movie!!!
91,2020-02-04 10:24:58,exxeip,That’s very fair.
92,2020-02-05 00:36:27,exxeip,BFE?
93,2020-02-06 12:57:34,exxeip,"Compare that with the video on youtube of Philip Quast explaining his thought process for the Les Mis song Stars, oh man. He pauses before certain words because the character is thinking of them in the moment."
94,2020-02-03 11:10:09,exxeip,"That’s one of the repeated jokes in the show, that her father repeatedly called her a boy because he was so oblivious as a parent.

Sad to hear the US tour didn’t hold up performance-wise, because it’s truly a lovely show, easily one of my favourite musicals."

Which is a big deal considering the caliber of talent in the cast, with people like Rachel York.  She had a lot of energy which showed in the performance. 

Definitely stunt-casting, for sure, but I don’t really mind in this case.  The character only appeared sporadically throughout the show, and I enjoyed what she did with the role.

I’d love to have seen the understudy in the role too, to see how different people played the character."

Netflix, which backed “The Irishman” and “Marriage Story,” was the least supportive of pro-gun politicians, donating just $10,200 over that period. It’s unclear if the figures that Guns Down America cites include AT&T the telecom giant that owns Warner Bros., the studio behind “Joker.” The group says that Warner Bros.’ political action committees donated $252,000 to pro-gun politicians.

I was just like, uh, I’ve talked to a couple of those guys and *literally all their friends died in the crisis*. Which *isn’t shocking*, given their particular age demo. Like do you know what that even does to a person?

Of course, a couple people were entirely unmoved, and informed me that emotional trauma is irrelevant. No, cis white gay men are just inherently semi-monsters. At least according to the wisdom of someone on tumblr with a bio that probably starts with something like “first of all unfollow me IMMEDIATELY if you have EVER followed [some random ‘abusive’ person who ships the wrong people in an obscure fandom].”

But try explaining about that to a cis straight Tumblrite who thinks ""ok boomer"" is a winning argument.

Frankly, I think it's because these days, with the education (some) people of sexually active age received, PrEP, antiretrovirals, et cetera, it's a very avoidable and treatable (but not curable) disease in the West. It isn't the death sentence it once was, provided you can afford the meds.

Ben Platt definitely fits the trend but I'm afraid he'll have filming obligations, maybe Jake Gyllenhaal?"

Ben Platt has a really distinct voice."

On that note, the magician Teller is considered very short but is average next to the very tall Penn Gillette.

Being a big fan of both duos, my mind was blown to discover that Garfunkel and Teller are close to the same height."

267,2020-03-06 17:34:42,fe1fhq,Yeah I liked him and his version of “Another one bites the dust” from Glee. It’s so different from his singing in Hamilton.

271,2020-02-26 03:10:29,f9fmd2,"I think it's kinda rediculous that your parents took one line at the end of the song to mean that you were coming out as trans. If I were you I'd be hurt. They think you're a ton boy because you are trans not because you are just not into all the girly crap. 

That's the only way I can see a parent jumping to that conclusion. Any person I know would conclude that he sings ""I'm a man..."" Because the singer is male....

Edit: imo you didn't fuck up here. The parents jumping to conclusions did. Besides what they say shouldn't matter. If your trans be proud. Who TF cares what others think?"

281,2020-02-24 00:09:24,f8hi1m,"I adore the music. Sound-wise it's right up my alley, but we can agree to disagree on that. 

The content took me a while to get behind, though. I actually didn't see it as cheesy so much as pretty harsh--the biggest message I took away from it immediately was that most feel-good stories we hear online are probably just as fabricated as Evan's was. And the line, ""I didn't realize Connor meant this much to people"" feels pretty harsh to me because...well, it wasn't true. Connor really wasn't a great person and he really didn't improve others' lives. It feels like it goes against the narrative surrounding this issue."
282,2020-02-23 23:05:03,f8hi1m,"it's only redeemable quality is the song ""sincerely me"", the rest of the songs all just kind of sound the same."
283,2020-02-24 00:44:05,f8hi1m,"I like the songs, they're good.  The story is alright. I like what it does with the message on suicide.  Specifically how we never actually get a look into Connors headspace. Much like real life once someone has taken it upon themselves to commit suicide often the story and spotlight gets taken up by people who want to make it about themselves.  I found it pretty cynical yet kinda accurate.  I wouldn't say it's the best musical but its perfectly fine in what it does and having seen it last night I can say I enjoyed seeing it live"
284,2020-02-23 22:58:36,f8hi1m,All musicals are bad.

When I was out of the US, I watched a lot of shows I found out later they were English dubbed in Canada. I think they are starting to get more dubs these recent years tho"

I have taught lots of musical theater singers over almost 3 decades, and have had lots of singers return to lessons after a long hiatus (some as long as 20 years).  I teach all styles and adjust the technique for the musical genre.  There is no substitute for studying privately, but you can learn a lot online if you choose carefully. I recommend my YouTube channel where I go into great detail about vocal technique (tons of info), explained in everyday language and include exercises. I give ""quick fixes"" as well as long term solutions, covering the basics and more.  If you want to sing in a style like those singers you mentioned, then you need to develop a good chest mix.  I have 3 videos on that.    [https://www.youtube.com/user/vrsing](https://www.youtube.com/user/vrsing).  This should get you started and keep you busy.

336,2020-04-17 15:22:55,g2zxvo,"Okay, considering that Hollywood will never cast theatre-people who don't appeal to the general public/ aren't stars I'm going to be very picky in assembling my cast. Also, Wicked is above all a melodramatic romance so the acting caliber of the actors doesn't need to be extremely high. 
I'm going for cynical realism in my casting, what will Hollywood want to cast? The crux of the original novel was racism but since the musical already nixed that theme in favor of romance I'm figuring Hollywood would double down on that but unironically highlight it again by race-bending the green-character and the villains. I'm only going to cast the main trio and the villains as the other characters will likely be divided up among less popular stars like Josh Gad, Dove Cameron etc. 

1. Elphaba, main star, needs to sing. : Janelle Monáe,  Lady Gaga, 

2. Galinda, comedic foil: Kristen Bell, Amanda Seyfried. 

3. Fiyero, above all else needs to be hot, could be the biggest pull for female audiences. : Jonathon Groff, Ansel Elgort, one of the 1D's.

4. The Wizard, opportunity for old Hollywood star, low commitment role:  Derek Jacobi, Morgan Freeman, Eddie Murphy, Pierce Brosnan. 

5. Madam Morrible, the main antagonist, scene chewer, older in age, also low commitment role: Glenn Close, Olivia Coleman., (why not:) Cher."
337,2020-04-18 00:22:29,g2zxvo,"Okay, but like, hear me out! 

Elephaba: Leah Michele, Lady Gaga, Beyoncé (think she would add something so much different I’m curious). Zendaya. 

Glinda: Amanda Seyfried, Anna Kendrick

Boq: Darren Criss, Ben Platt, Josh Gad 

Fiyero: Zac Zefron, Shawn Mendes, Jeremy Jordan, Chris Pine 

Madame Morrible: Julie Andrews, I would love to see her playing the villainess, something I don’t think I’ve ever seen her do. Meryl Streep. 

The Wizard: Hugh Jackman, Alan Cumming, 

Dr. Dillamond: Neil Patrick Harris"
338,2020-04-17 18:38:01,g2zxvo,"For a long time, after smash was cancelled, I really wanted Kathrine McPhee and Megan Hilty to do the movie. I don’t think it’s too late. But they’d be seriously pushing it."
339,2020-04-19 17:14:44,g2zxvo,I feel like Lea and Laura’s voices are too high for Elphaba.
340,2020-04-22 07:59:11,g2zxvo,Nessarose can use her legs by the end of the story. I adore Ali Stroker but unless they use CGI or something that casting seems a little odd.
341,2020-04-17 17:31:07,g2zxvo,This is the most sensible cast list I've seen for this movie. Glenn Close has always been my dream choice for Morrible!!
342,2020-04-17 19:39:59,g2zxvo,"I freakin' love Cher or Olivia Coleman as Madam Morrible.

I also completely agree; Lady Gaga would be an amazing Elphaba.

My one thoughts are Taron Egerton for Fiyero (he's a dreamboat lol) and Hugh Jackman as the Wizard. He would be a charismatic villain which I think could be super interesting."
343,2020-04-17 20:02:57,g2zxvo,Didn't you see Mamma Mia? Please don't make us sit through Pierce Brosnan trying to sing again.
344,2020-04-18 00:28:03,g2zxvo,Harry Styles is a decent actor not to mention a highly popular musician so I could see him being cast as Figaro.
345,2020-04-18 00:39:59,g2zxvo,"Seeing Kristen Bell and Lady Gaga performing together is a dream I didn't know I had until now. 

Also Eddie Murphy as The Wizard would be great."
346,2020-04-18 00:02:10,g2zxvo,"Can we add Zefron to the Fiyero list, I just wanna see him in those pants 😍"
347,2020-04-18 00:26:49,g2zxvo,I've only ever seen Julie Andrews playing good intentioned characters before but now I want to see her as a villain. Defiantly think she could pull if off.
348,2020-04-18 00:23:59,g2zxvo,I would love to see Katharine and Megan together again as well. They had awsome chemistry on Smash.
349,2020-04-22 08:26:47,g2zxvo,"I wasn't aware of that detail, I've never actually had a chance to see the show. I'm a big Ali Stroker fan as well."
350,2020-04-18 00:27:50,g2zxvo,"The best part is Madame Morrible doesn’t sing much, and I think Julie Andrews still doesn’t sing too much anyways, so I really felt like it would be a perfect fit. And I wanna see her just be absolutely maniacal!!"
351,2020-04-18 00:29:32,g2zxvo,Perfect casting confirmed. :)
352,2020-09-03 18:31:24,g2zxvo,She voiced the Sea Monster in Aquaman
353,2020-04-18 00:30:30,g2zxvo,Thank you! I had another one for the Wizard but as I was typing Alan Cumming I lost the name and I’m so upset lol
354,2020-04-18 00:32:11,g2zxvo,That's a great choice also. There's so many amazing choices for this movie and this thread has gotten me even more pumped to see the eventual cast list.
355,2020-04-18 00:34:47,g2zxvo,But if Julie Andrews isn’t Morrible imma boycott
356,2020-04-13 19:38:16,g0k8xe,"The lighting, the word flubs, the confusion. This is the most ICONIC Miscast performance of all time."
357,2020-04-13 17:23:20,g0k8xe,This one and the Katrina Lenk 'If I Were a Rich Man' are two of my favorite misCast/Broadway Backwards performances ever!
358,2020-04-13 20:50:23,g0k8xe,"The sixth one is Walter Bobbie, director of Chicago"
359,2020-04-13 19:42:32,g0k8xe,"I love this song, not to mention all of the amazing actor performing it in this cover"
360,2020-04-14 13:26:01,g0k8xe,When they be sexier than you........
361,2020-04-13 21:17:14,g0k8xe,Oh god... the lighting! That poor tech just could NOT get it together. So. Many. Cues.

364,2020-04-12 04:54:48,fzq6w2,"Also Cynthia Erivo, Shoshana Bean, Josh Groban, Alan Menken, Stephen Schwartz, Shaina Taub, and Skylar Astin. 

I’m not religious and *really* not Jewish, but this was beautiful and uplifting.  I recommend everyone watch.  (I cried twice.)

Bonus that I didn’t realize until the credits, one of the producers was Benj Pasek and he helped write a couple original songs."
365,2020-04-12 14:25:53,fzq6w2,I loved all of this! The songs were beautiful. I want to learn more about what seder is.
366,2020-04-12 05:51:27,fzq6w2,"It was so wonderful- I love the songs they wrote, no doubt they will be added to my Passover playlist for next year!"
367,2020-04-12 09:32:07,fzq6w2,This was super cute!!
368,2020-04-12 11:28:22,fzq6w2,This was incredible. A once-in-a-lifetime line up 🙏
369,2020-04-12 19:46:12,fzq6w2,"This was so well produced!  *Cough* SNL should take some notes.

I'm not even Jewish either and I thoroughly enjoyed it plus I learned a lot about the history and traditions I didn't know before.  Cynthia & Shoshana's  Prince of Egypt duet was my favorite (actually Prince of Egypt movie was when I first learned about Passover). I can't believe they pulled off harmonies that well over Zoom video chat."

389,2020-04-29 04:06:17,fux4qg,I agree with everything. All my friends rave about DEH but I don’t get the hype. I listened to it and could hardly remember any of the songs because they all sound the same. And my biggest qualm was that Evan is manipulative. Like were we supposed to root for you when you used someone’s suicide to make you seem better?
390,2020-04-04 17:17:12,fux4qg,"Plus, the message is fucked up in so many levels. His life actually gets better after he pretends to be best friends with the guy who just committed suicide. It's almost like 13 Reasons Why in the sense that it glamorizes suicide."
391,2020-06-26 10:22:13,fux4qg,"I agree that it's similar to an Oscar Bait movie but in a different sense, because it gets all the critical acclaim while similarly-teen-geared-and-issue-dealing-with shows like Heathers, Be More Chill and even The Lightning Thief get mocked"

453,2020-03-31 03:05:12,fs2b30,"I think BWL is the right decision to perform because of how much Korea loves that song and how positive it is. It reminds a lot of us of fun memories of 2019, and some of us need to reminisce those times in order to keep on going. :) 

I also felt like that they toned down the performance too. It felt weird in the beginning but I kinda understand. It would be weird to be their natural extra flirty self when you're singing under such dark times for everyone. We love them as they are. They dont need to prove their charisma every time they perform, we will still enjoy the song either way. 💜"
454,2020-03-31 03:09:42,fs2b30,"I was puzzled by BWL just like everyone here but if their only alternatives were ON and Black swan then BWL makes sense. They clearly didn't want to go ""all out"" and really ""hard"" given the casual tone of the show and BWL fits that. Firstly because it fits the casual vibe more, they've performed it with a more casual vibe many times now, even in concerts they mess around and play around instead of firmly sticking to choreo and I think bwl suits that more than ON and Black swan whilst still looking cute. Secondly because it is an old song and at a stage where they can be chill with it whereas On and black swan are still new you wouldn't want to be all loose with the choreo of a new song yet! Additionally, they probably didn't want to debut a new song on this kind of stage tbh hence no other options."

Regarding the performance, I was super surprised to hear BWL, but happy because it really is the greatest serotonin boost. I know many of us would love to see them showcase a new side (new song/acoustic version of older song), but when I think about BWL being “A Poem for Small Things” the choice makes sense considering the current state of the world. Simple joys are keeping me afloat right now.

Anyways, my comment was long for no reason lol. I woke up emotional. I really enjoyed scrolling through the thread and reading everyone’s thoughts/reactions. Stay safe everyone 💜"

613,2020-03-31 03:00:23,fs2b30,"I missed them so much, I hope we can see them performing again soon, this was so great and heartwarming"
614,2020-03-31 03:06:25,fs2b30,"They all looked so good, I'm glad they could feel a little closer to us and that they have each other"

621,2020-03-31 01:36:35,fs2b30,I remember the first time I heard/saw them perform I Need U and felt that butterflies in my stomach feeling.  Its amazing after all these years I still get them for things like this.  Its not even LIVE!  lol
622,2020-03-31 01:59:11,fs2b30,cruel to play Let Go when we won't make it to Jin's verse

632,2020-03-31 02:22:08,fs2b30,"bro I'm SO dumb I just woke up, grabbed my phone and started watching and was so confused to see run playing over a clip of some old people and thought I'd missed the bts performance, a performance that consisted of them advocating for some sentimental cause and all they did was play their music in the background. It didn't make sense when the Samsung phone ad popped up either 😭😭"
633,2020-03-31 02:24:40,fs2b30,"I wonder if Marilyn Monroe ever even fathomed the kind of American iconography she would become, insane"

637,2020-03-31 02:33:30,fs2b30,I like that the dancers are in workout clothes with buns 😂
638,2020-03-31 02:34:45,fs2b30,"I'm so confused about this. Are the performances pre-recorded? I thought everything was going to be live, but some of the performances seem way too complicated to coordinate live."

647,2020-03-31 02:44:16,fs2b30,This is so beautiful.
648,2020-03-31 02:44:47,fs2b30,BRAVO BELLISIMO

660,2020-03-31 02:54:27,fs2b30,I just saw them and I'm already sad because they're gone.
661,2020-03-31 02:56:11,fs2b30,"Oh this was so cute! I was missing BWL as overperformed as it is and it's always a joy to watch it, they seem to have fun with it and their cozy looks were adorable. Taebaby was too cute for my heart to handle. Ah I missed my boys 💜"
662,2020-03-31 03:05:59,fs2b30,"This was a fun show, thank Corden and crew, and everyone else involved, and I'm glad that the live stream I ended up watching had bangtan songs playing over the ads, lmao

665,2020-03-31 02:54:30,fs2b30,All I could see was JKs legs in those tight pants.
666,2020-03-31 02:56:28,fs2b30,"Ayee!!! Great choice with BWL. i would have preferred one of their more intimate songs and have a little ARMYPEDIA moment but this is also good! 

Who else was expecting them performing in a lounge or living room-esque area in the BH building and not their practice room tho? 😅 i should have known. Lol

Edit: even in their casual clothing they look so stylish. Joon’s plaid hoodie and Tae’s loose clothing and Yoongi’s bright sweater. Pleaseee. They all look so good."
667,2020-03-31 02:56:45,fs2b30,"Okay, that was actually really cute..

Love them doing the performance in the dance practice room.

Jin kinda looked bored doing the same performance again though, lol"
668,2020-03-31 00:10:10,fs2b30,Hey guys I'm really lost and busy between meetings so brain is not working. Can someone tell me if its just gonna be a BTS performance or there'll be interview segments too?
669,2020-03-31 00:16:53,fs2b30,"I can't wait, I miss them so much!"
670,2020-03-31 00:32:33,fs2b30,My body is ready. I've been missing BTS something fierce lately and this'll help a little bit. :')
671,2020-03-31 00:34:45,fs2b30,"Man, I'm so ready for this. Day 21 of isolation and this is exactly what I need right now."

So tonight I’m hoping for black swan classical version 🙏🏻 and Home."
676,2020-03-31 02:05:22,fs2b30,I have the feeling I am going to cry. The monologue is making me emotional already.
677,2020-03-31 02:07:53,fs2b30,LOVE John and Chrissy!! Chrissy has been keeping me entertained with her shenanigans.
678,2020-03-31 02:08:21,fs2b30,Very curious what they're going to perform lol.
679,2020-03-31 02:10:16,fs2b30,"Whew I made it. Frantically made dinner before settling in, I think I'll have time during a commercial break to wash a pan I had to let cool down. 

Lesgeddit, we're gonna see the Tannies and a bunch of other amazing performers tonight!"
680,2020-03-31 02:10:22,fs2b30,Damn it John Legend. 😢😭
681,2020-03-31 02:10:41,fs2b30,"I really like hearing his reverb in the house, I’m still dreaming of the day I can have a large house to practice my broadway singing haha"
682,2020-03-31 02:11:08,fs2b30,"So since Namjoon posted a pic of him in a suit on twitter the other day, do you guys think its going to be a choreo performance or a causal sitdown one?"
683,2020-03-31 02:11:56,fs2b30,I prayed and I’m going with god. I got DoorDash (Popeyes) and their dry ass biscuits. Not gonna lie I love their dry ass biscuits.

699,2020-03-31 02:31:05,fs2b30,BTS will probs be last lmao
700,2020-03-31 02:31:20,fs2b30,If they only do one song (since this special is hella packed) I think Black Swan acoustic or Make It Right (lol)
701,2020-03-31 02:31:40,fs2b30,This is cute. I’m growing a fondness for Dua Lipa as of late!
702,2020-03-31 02:32:09,fs2b30,I am so dumb and only know this song from tiktoks
703,2020-03-31 02:34:45,fs2b30,"Dua looked so cute! And brought some more upbeat-ness, which is also nice"
704,2020-03-31 02:36:12,fs2b30,I am the Energizer bunny vibin to Come Back Home

707,2020-03-31 02:41:39,fs2b30,"After seeing Will Ferrell, now I all I can think of with this song is blades of glory 😩"
708,2020-03-31 02:42:12,fs2b30,"Oh no, his voice, the shots of people, oh no"
709,2020-03-31 02:42:20,fs2b30,It’s so so so so sad what has happened in Italy. I truly fear that this will happen to the US in the next few months.
710,2020-03-31 02:42:36,fs2b30,His singing looks so effortless
711,2020-03-31 02:44:45,fs2b30,My heart hurts.
712,2020-03-31 02:44:59,fs2b30,I literally stood up to applaud.
713,2020-03-31 02:45:05,fs2b30,"Yeah that will probably be my favorite performance of the night, but maybe the boys will surprise me!"
714,2020-03-31 02:45:27,fs2b30,Eso fue hermoso! VIVA ITALIA
715,2020-03-31 02:48:21,fs2b30,"jeez, Bocelli was beautiful. Kinda wish that had gone last, would have an been amazing finale"
716,2020-03-31 02:50:18,fs2b30,Well no one was expecting that lol
717,2020-03-31 02:51:06,fs2b30,Oh we're getting the practice studio version.
718,2020-03-31 02:51:26,fs2b30,All I see is yoongi in his bright pink hoodie.
719,2020-03-31 02:52:55,fs2b30,I'm loving Hobi's outfit
720,2020-03-31 02:53:30,fs2b30,Namjoon with the hood flip - so smooth
721,2020-03-31 02:54:08,fs2b30,i've gotten so used to seeing txt dance practices here i'm expecting them to pop up anytime lol
722,2020-03-31 02:56:35,fs2b30,why am i BAWLING ohhh my god namjoon's verse hit so hard
723,2020-03-31 02:59:47,fs2b30,Wait can someone tell me the name of this song? I haven’t seen this musical! It’s really great.
724,2020-03-31 03:01:20,fs2b30,"That was a really great song to end on, really nice to hang out with you all for a bit :)"
725,2020-03-31 04:03:38,fs2b30,IM SO CHARMED BY THEM ALWAYS
726,2020-03-31 05:30:47,fs2b30,Blaine’s second card trick didn’t work for me... my color was cerulean... :/
727,2020-03-31 02:52:39,fs2b30,V dancing in those slides i love it lol
728,2020-03-31 03:23:55,fs2b30,"Could only see the performance now. You got me scared in the comments and was expecting the worst, but I loved it!

 Of course they weren't going to be flirty and extra smiley as they usually are with BWL considering the circumstances and the fact that they are performing for a show in another country - the social protocol is very complex in Korea, better not risk it in a (virtually) unknown country to them in terms of social reactions and customs."
729,2020-03-31 02:56:49,fs2b30,"You know what, tbh I was left puzzled by the choice of song. 

But it's a time to practice gratefulness so I'm grateful for that."
730,2020-03-31 02:40:35,fs2b30,“This is only for you” why does this sound like something that Jin would say? 😂
731,2020-03-31 13:12:31,fs2b30,"I woke up and watched the whole episode and guys, I really feel like I needed this... I've missed the boys so much regardless of their twitter posts etc. This time is so tenuous and weird and hard and I feel like this hour with just random artists I normally wouldn't listen to made me feel much more light and comfortable. 

I'll be honest, I skipped over John Legend and Billie Eilish. I don't like Billie's voice (other than ""Bad Guy"") and I figured we'd get ""All of Me"" from John. I did listen to parts of the end; his voice is still just as crooner-y as ever. Nice song too. 

Dua Lipa's voice is so clear and beautiful even via video conference. I don't listen to her music for the most part other than the radio, but this was awesome. I loved that she included her dancers. 

Andrea Bocelli's song was so gorgeous. He flies into that high note with so much ease and he's not even in falsetto. I loved that he held that last note for so long while also playing the piano and he didn't fall flat at all. His talent amazes me. When they showed those planes with the colored jet streams I nearly cried. I can't imagine what Italy is going through right now. 

The boys didn't look their usual flirty selves, but I get that this is a tough time for them. They started getting there by the end, but I think they just miss interacting with us just as much as we do them. My heart soared with every Jungkook smile and the kissy face by Jin. 

Seeing all those artists from Dear Evan Hansen crying while singing was beautiful. Ben Platt has just an amazing voice. This show, despite never having seen it, makes me feel much less lonely in this world."
732,2020-03-31 00:26:39,fs2b30,I'm so excited for this!! Right before my bedtime. Major props to ARMY outside of North America staying up late or waking up early for this. 💜
733,2020-03-31 00:35:08,fs2b30,"Oh man I didn't realize it would be 10 EST, I wasn't going to stay up and now I'm really tempted"
734,2020-03-31 00:44:23,fs2b30,Very unlikely to happen but i still lowkey hope that they'll perform Home. 🏡😅
735,2020-03-31 00:56:40,fs2b30,BEN PLATT JUST JOINED THE LINEUP AND IM SO EXCITED FOR TONIGHT!!!!

739,2020-03-31 01:55:40,fs2b30,Are they going to air them near the end?  please don't air them toward the end.  There's only so many commercials I can watch.
740,2020-03-31 02:00:03,fs2b30,Qdeoks had the nerve to play Let Go after Jin's Weverse post I'm sad

742,2020-03-31 02:01:56,fs2b30,LET'S GET IT!
743,2020-03-31 02:02:24,fs2b30,just want people to be aware that not just BTS fans are tuning in and they most likely want to see their fav perform at certain times for certain lengths. I’m happy to get what we get! This is supposedly for charity.

787,2020-03-31 02:49:22,fs2b30,JK IS SO CUTE WITH THAT HOOD
788,2020-03-31 02:49:33,fs2b30,"Here come the tears.

Edit: Never mind, can't cry to Boy With Luv."
789,2020-03-31 02:49:39,fs2b30,....did he just say Boy with Luv
790,2020-03-31 02:49:50,fs2b30,Jk and Yoongi Contrast.... crying

793,2020-03-31 02:55:58,fs2b30,"Alright, good night everyone lol"
794,2020-03-31 02:56:54,fs2b30,Aww James is putting how I’ve been feeling into words. I appreciate him for putting this together
795,2020-03-31 03:05:53,fs2b30,"I love Ben Platt.  Dear Evan Hanson was an amazing show and inspirational score, and Ben’s voice is one of the most genuinely present and emotionally evocative. I know not many probably stayed and listened to this last number but for those feeling isolated and disconcerted by the current events, hearing Ben and the cast of DEH sing together was so moving and inspirational."
796,2020-03-31 03:36:25,fs2b30,"I fell asleep and woke up to play it on my DVR... 

Was it me or did BWL sound reaaally fast? 
Probably just me but I was like still half awake and not processing anything. 

I was happy with it-- thought they'd do On or MIR but glad they were on the show at all.

I'm surprised they filmed it a while ago-- I think I was thrown off by Namjoons Weverse post. 

I missed them."
797,2020-03-31 09:08:11,fs2b30,"I can’t believe I missed this!😭😭😭

I got confused by the time zones again 😔😞"
798,2020-03-31 03:58:28,fs2b30,"During the airing I was disappointed that they played BWL, but after rewatching the performance, I realize I haven't seen BWL for quite some time, and I love it! Them in comfy dance practice fits sends so much uwu. Yes they looked sad, but they did goof around!

Each time they're smiling and goofing is practically a blessing. Wondered why Jin was smiling around [1:35](https://youtu.be/J5WLNpDt2uU?t=95), turns out that Jimin almost forgot his position uwu. Tae going around in [2:50](https://youtu.be/J5WLNpDt2uU?t=169) with that baggy outift just looks cuuute. And they were flashing V sign/peace fingers when Joon was rapping - wonder what that was?

It's really moodlifting in this kind of time. Honorable mention to JK's skinny jeans lol."
799,2020-03-31 03:48:22,fs2b30,"I'm honestly surprised as to why people were expecting WAB or louder than bombs,do you think that they'd want their first performance of those songs to be like this,especially when there's no audience.Fans can be a little too selfish at times,I feel.Anyway I'm grateful."
800,2020-03-31 02:44:21,fs2b30,Ok but if the boys start singing We are Bulletproof the Eternal or Spring Day then I will be in literal shambles 😭😭
801,2020-03-31 02:51:13,fs2b30,Lol did they cover JKs tattoos
802,2020-03-31 03:03:06,fs2b30,Anyone have an idea what jacket Jungkook was wearing? I’m obsessed with that fit

804,2020-03-31 04:02:31,fs2b30,"oh, jimin’s wearing a wings tour hoodie 🥺"
805,2020-03-31 02:51:53,fs2b30,also did JK get fashion inspo from Jimin?
806,2020-03-31 02:17:31,fs2b30,I'm honestly not interested in how rich celebrities are coping.
807,2020-03-31 02:59:07,fs2b30,"i know they know we miss them as much as they miss us, they looked sad during the performance 🥺"
808,2020-03-31 02:29:46,fs2b30,i hope they perform WAB:TE so i can cry and be happy and I HOPE IT MAKES EVERY HATER ON HERE WHO VOTED HER OUT CRY THE MOST TEARS 😂😭
809,2020-03-31 02:51:27,fs2b30,Was Jimin not feeling well during this recording? I know he mentioned in his VLive recently that he just got over something
810,2020-03-31 00:00:57,fs2b30,How long will the episode last?
811,2020-03-31 00:43:21,fs2b30,Excited to see what they will perform! Have a feeling it might be a more laidback performance :)
812,2020-03-31 00:44:07,fs2b30,Yay! I can't wait to see them perform again 💜💜

825,2020-03-31 02:14:46,fs2b30,I can’t tell if playing run over will Farrell is intentional but it’s hilarious
826,2020-03-31 02:15:20,fs2b30,"Hahahaha Chandelier by Will Ferrell. Amazing.

YASSSSS!!!

One of their BEST stage performances was the CBH + NMD + Mic Drop"
837,2020-03-31 02:26:57,fs2b30,If they sing we are bulletproof: the eternal....they wouldn’t do that to us would they? WOULD THEY!?
838,2020-03-31 02:29:54,fs2b30,I ended up with “navy blue” at the end of that trick 🤔
839,2020-03-31 02:30:04,fs2b30,"I wonder if they'll have a piano too. Let's see, these are my guesses the song they performed;

-Make It Right

-Mikrokosmos

-We Are Bulletproof: Eternal (wishful thinking)

-Boy Wit Luv (maybe acoustic)"
840,2020-03-31 02:30:04,fs2b30,Cerulean?

848,2020-03-31 02:35:32,fs2b30,Was trying to think of a breakfast food beginning with e but somehow didn't think of eggs...
849,2020-03-31 02:40:20,fs2b30,but what about an acoustic version of on
850,2020-03-31 02:42:23,fs2b30,Wow! I love this song so much. I needed this

I hope they perform another song after BWL. I want Louder than Bombs. 

Watch it be Make It Right tho hahaha I'm sure the tracks on 7 won't be performed until they go on tour."
1002,2020-03-31 02:15:15,fs2b30,Nooooooo I love Run but I wanna listen to Will Ferrell 😭 maybe time to find a different stream for now lol
1003,2020-03-31 02:58:34,fs2b30,I sung this song back in high school chorus 😭
1004,2020-03-31 02:19:23,fs2b30,Finneas has to be one of the best big brothers in the world.
1005,2020-03-31 02:55:55,fs2b30,"Not sure if they were half asleep or if they were supposed to perform something else, but they clearly didn't give their all for that :/"
1006,2020-03-31 02:27:17,fs2b30,I bet Taehyung and Jin might want to do it along.
1007,2020-03-31 02:29:45,fs2b30,Man the HD channels is not working for Fios in my area right now.... Going to have to watch in SD. D:

Yeap and lol are you me? I fell into the BTS rabbit hole in January too and now this quarantine is accelerating my binge of their content even more... And Taehyung was the one who dragged me into this."
1038,2020-03-31 03:01:41,fs2b30,"I was thinking that the entire time, but I loved his outfit."
1039,2020-03-31 01:11:20,fs2b30,Aw welcome to the fandom
1040,2020-03-31 01:09:56,fs2b30,I'm sure it'll be really fun! That's super cute :)
1041,2020-03-31 01:20:27,fs2b30,Awwh welcome!! I hope you enjoy it! :)
1042,2020-03-31 01:45:23,fs2b30,"New ARMY here, too. I was prepared to take off work to go to one of their concerts, but that plan was put on hold. I can't wait until this starts."

1044,2020-03-31 02:56:37,fs2b30,I came here to  make this comment.
1045,2020-03-31 05:23:13,fs2b30,I agree.
1046,2020-03-31 02:59:27,fs2b30,"literally living for both of their fits

the duality~"
1047,2020-03-31 03:18:42,fs2b30,that look really does suit him!
1048,2020-03-31 02:37:32,fs2b30,Lmao what?!
1049,2020-03-31 02:43:39,fs2b30,😪
1050,2020-03-31 02:56:03,fs2b30,"I noticed that almost immediately! I was really hoping he wouldn’t fall, but of course the performance was great!"
1051,2020-03-31 02:54:41,fs2b30,He was lmao
1052,2020-03-31 02:54:54,fs2b30,Yes lol
1053,2020-03-31 02:55:01,fs2b30,Top 10 all time fit
1054,2020-03-31 02:57:46,fs2b30,I loved Dua!!!! Both of BTS and Dua's albums are on repeat for me. So these were perfect timing!
1055,2020-03-31 02:58:16,fs2b30,I know I'll probably never wear it but I'm so obsessed with those boots.
1056,2020-03-31 03:04:59,fs2b30,I was waiting for a slipper to go flying lol
1057,2020-03-31 04:31:55,fs2b30,"I thought he wore them on purpose so he could yeet them off, like he likes to do with his shoes"
1058,2020-03-31 02:20:20,fs2b30,Has Billie graduated from high school yet?
1059,2020-03-31 02:45:49,fs2b30,Health and Safety Vibes to your family! 💜
1060,2020-03-31 02:55:47,fs2b30,Was thinking the same!! Iconic tbh
1061,2020-03-31 03:24:20,fs2b30,"I think also in context of everything going on globally, they probably wanted to show something more lighthearted and positive like BWL."
1062,2020-03-31 03:22:51,fs2b30,[deleted]
1063,2020-03-31 03:19:26,fs2b30,"I do agree mostly. It’s well liked internationally and probably the most well known song in the US besides Idol. 

still ... unexpected."
1064,2020-03-31 03:19:34,fs2b30,"I agree, they know it so well muscle memory just takes them through.

Also, Namjoon can dance it really well now. I actually couldn’t take my eyes off him."
1065,2020-03-31 03:14:06,fs2b30,"They had other alternatives though. They could've looked at what recent b-sides have sold/streamed more in the US and done something with zero choreo. Idk doing BwL felt almost out of touch to me, it was a weird decision. Happy to see other people liked it though, maybe quarantine has just made me snippy

edit: I literally just said I wasn't going to complain too loudly at yet here I am, a disgrace"
1066,2020-03-31 02:03:56,fs2b30,"Ngl it did give me a laugh, it's so large lol. Should we expect JK to be in anything less than a giant black hoodie when ""home"" though?"
1067,2020-03-31 02:55:05,fs2b30,His boots plus the skinny jeans made me spontaneously combust
1068,2020-03-31 03:43:38,fs2b30,"That's such a good point! I forget the GP don't watch every bomb and practice video like we do so this is probably their first time seeing them with minimal makeup and jewelry in their own casual wardrobe. Many are still thrown by their polished performance looks, thinking it looks feminine etc. Not saying I agree but that sentiment is definitely present in western countries. But here they just look like a bunch of ""dudes"" just hanging out at home. They're still beautiful and totally rocking it."
1069,2020-03-31 03:01:39,fs2b30,At first I was like whut? but my sentiments are same as you right now.
1070,2020-03-31 02:59:17,fs2b30,Yes! That makes perfect sense. I've had doubters say they're always dolled up & that's why they're pretty. Not so!
1071,2020-03-31 01:18:36,fs2b30,Haha I've got a meeting at 2pm - blocking out my lunch at 1 so I get no surprise calls 😜

1075,2020-03-31 02:36:35,fs2b30,How does he know
1076,2020-03-31 02:35:19,fs2b30,I was actually just saying this!!
1077,2020-03-31 03:06:15,fs2b30,My whole timeline is just Jungkook’s legs haha
1078,2020-03-31 03:21:18,fs2b30,I may or may not have frozen my you tube for a few minutes at the moment Joon shirt rose up when he jumped.

1083,2020-03-31 02:28:50,fs2b30,Me toooo hahaha got me way too hyped
1084,2020-03-31 02:29:05,fs2b30,Same 😂 my heart skipped a beat
1085,2020-03-31 02:32:38,fs2b30,Omg me too lol
1086,2020-03-31 02:46:57,fs2b30,I actually clapped. That was beautiful 🥰
1087,2020-03-31 03:18:14,fs2b30,the infamous jacket
1088,2020-03-31 03:32:29,fs2b30,Obsessed with his whole fit! He looked so good in this!
1089,2020-03-31 04:13:22,fs2b30,2021 our time baby
1090,2020-03-31 12:17:07,fs2b30,"Yesssss.

So, his bias is Yoongs, right? 😂"
1091,2020-03-31 05:40:27,fs2b30,Joon was feelin himself today. We love confident and cool Joon!!
1092,2020-03-31 05:19:38,fs2b30,Was it because he showed his tummy? 😉
1093,2020-03-31 05:43:24,fs2b30,"I had this exact same reaction on both counts. He was moving more fluidly than usual. Also love how everyone talks about 'abs' on the other guys but 'tummy' with Joon. 

The absence of SOPE made me a little sad though. I wonder if they're removing that from the choreo? Because technically this is a MOTS:7 song, so it's possible they could change it, but that was my favourite part."
1094,2020-03-31 02:20:48,fs2b30,her voice and piano might be recorded through different mics
1095,2020-03-31 02:22:15,fs2b30,It could be the one mic just picking up the piano better? Pianos usually are a lot louder than people and she's singing pretty softly
1096,2020-03-31 02:20:29,fs2b30,Literally what my husband and I were just talking about
1097,2020-03-31 02:20:41,fs2b30,Right?!
1098,2020-03-31 02:22:01,fs2b30,she got her sound engineer in lockdown with her
1099,2020-03-31 02:24:35,fs2b30,At least we have that buzz feed interview with puppies!
1100,2020-03-31 02:25:39,fs2b30,"The closest thing we have is the buzzfeed puppy interview... But imagine every member holding a puppy on one hand and a mic on the other one 😭 like Armypedia, but with puppies."
1101,2020-03-31 02:34:13,fs2b30,Yeah.  you can't create that type of harmonious sound from a zoom chat.
1102,2020-03-31 02:34:45,fs2b30,I want them to sing spring day so baadd
1103,2020-03-31 02:42:11,fs2b30,Con te partio!
1104,2020-03-31 02:42:32,fs2b30,Time to say goodbye
1105,2020-03-31 02:12:16,fs2b30,😂😂 I noticed his awards too.
1106,2020-03-31 02:12:45,fs2b30,That attention to detail! I didn't catch that lol
1107,2020-03-31 02:15:57,fs2b30,I just imagined the frantic scramble to get it to turn off. haha
1108,2020-03-31 02:42:18,fs2b30,ohh I thought i remembered the pink that yoongi was wearing!
1109,2020-03-31 02:42:54,fs2b30,Yeah their clothes looked familiar!
1110,2020-03-31 02:45:58,fs2b30,def recognized jimin’s sweatshirt too!
1111,2020-03-31 01:41:54,fs2b30,[Corden staff thinks they're funny](https://twitter.com/latelateshow/status/1244800764226109440?s=20)
1112,2020-03-31 01:45:08,fs2b30,A louder than bombs would be amazing!
1113,2020-03-31 02:07:15,fs2b30,Actually the outfits are the same ones when they shot the Covid-19 video since they were nominated by Korean Nursing Academy. I think that video was 2 weeks ago.
1114,2020-03-31 02:04:50,fs2b30,so his selca with black hair is an old one 🤔
1115,2020-03-31 02:10:17,fs2b30,But please don't stand hand in hand. Stay 6 feet or 2 metres apart
1116,2020-03-31 02:11:08,fs2b30,James trying to ask the same question multiple times while getting interrupted felt like my family’s hectic zoom call haha
1117,2020-03-31 02:11:56,fs2b30,"Lol yep trying not to talk over each other, resulting in long pauses"
1118,2020-03-31 02:17:35,fs2b30,Aww I would be a little cranky! But that’s really awesome and I am glad you got a day off - thanks for what you do. :)
1119,2020-03-31 02:19:44,fs2b30,"Oh I've learned to turn it off, because some people are just disgusting :c"
1120,2020-03-31 02:23:43,fs2b30,doubt he was made to cover them. all other US T.V performances they did you could see them very clearly
1121,2020-03-31 02:23:08,fs2b30,i don’t see them at all either!
1122,2020-03-31 02:25:07,fs2b30,Maybe it's a mirror and we can't really see the back of his left hand
1123,2020-03-31 02:26:17,fs2b30,-puts on tin foil hat-
1124,2020-03-31 02:27:54,fs2b30,Same 😭
1125,2020-03-31 02:29:08,fs2b30,Can you see What song is BTS performing?!
1126,2020-03-31 02:38:57,fs2b30,I'm ready for him to simultaneously break my heart and heal my ears with that voice 😌
1127,2020-03-31 02:44:18,fs2b30,i feel ya
1128,2020-04-01 02:09:59,fs2b30,Didn’t he look INCREDIBLE?! The flash of skin and those tight jeans... he REALLY looked good
1129,2020-03-31 03:24:11,fs2b30,I would've cried if Corden busted out a song from Cats omg
1130,2020-03-31 02:53:55,fs2b30,Lumberjack Joon works for me!
1131,2020-03-31 01:07:10,fs2b30,I doubt it considering how many guests there are. I wish though!
1132,2020-03-31 02:55:29,fs2b30,I thought it fit right in the theme of the show. All casual and homey.
1133,2020-03-31 00:23:30,fs2b30,I can tell from your snack that we're in the same timezone 👌🏼
1134,2020-03-31 00:40:26,fs2b30,Hello there! I was planning to sleep first but I’m too excited.
1135,2020-03-31 01:16:17,fs2b30,I could really go a hot cross bun right about now 🤤
1136,2020-03-31 02:23:06,fs2b30,I think it’s has to be some kind of stripped down version of one of their songs

1138,2020-03-31 02:28:42,fs2b30,"That was the armypedia concert, it was so lovely! I think we'll get something like that :)"
1139,2020-03-31 02:36:01,fs2b30,"I just told someone this! 
As we now BTS are closers. 🤪"
1140,2020-03-31 05:06:57,fs2b30,Omg yes. And did anyone else notice Jimin slyly pulling joon's hood down? So cute. You'd have to take your eyes off Jin's air kiss to notice it so totally understandable if not...
1141,2020-03-31 03:19:37,fs2b30,[deleted]
1142,2020-03-31 02:55:26,fs2b30,it was PERFECTION. his boots...his all black fit....his longer hair....made my night lol
1143,2020-03-31 02:56:54,fs2b30,Literally was going to comment this. I want his nice long legs and adorable outfit !!
1144,2020-03-31 02:19:14,fs2b30,Yes. That's his thing.
1145,2020-03-31 02:21:12,fs2b30,"I’ve never seen him outside of movies but his appearance was a bit long, no? 
Was anyone else waiting to actually see the hand washing happening? 😆"
1146,2020-03-31 02:25:53,fs2b30,Quarantine thoughts.
1147,2020-03-31 02:28:00,fs2b30,I'ma really lose it if that happens omg
1148,2020-03-31 02:28:09,fs2b30,WHATTAYAUJQKWKWKWLWL
1149,2020-03-31 02:33:22,fs2b30,YES what a nice playlist!!!
1150,2020-03-31 02:33:54,fs2b30,YASSSSSSSS FOR LITTLE MIX JUST YASSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!! 🥰😍😘💜
1151,2020-03-31 02:34:21,fs2b30,Caution is so good!! I'm so happy that The Killers are coming back
1152,2020-03-31 02:36:34,fs2b30,No way it is live. They have to prerecord it to make sure everything goes as planned. There is too high a chance of technical difficulties if this format was live. Besides isn't Corden always pre-recorded?
1153,2020-03-31 02:35:17,fs2b30,Yeah things are working out too well to be live
1154,2020-03-31 02:36:39,fs2b30,Definitely seems pre-recorded.
1155,2020-03-31 02:37:02,fs2b30,corden (and like all late night tv shows) are prerecorded usually during office hours i think
1156,2020-03-31 02:54:58,fs2b30,I would think their hair can only get better and healthier since they’re not gonna do much to it right now! But yes they do have great hair! I was fawning over Jimin’s in his vlive last night!
1157,2020-03-31 02:54:41,fs2b30,this is a mood
1158,2020-03-31 02:58:06,fs2b30,Loved the pants!
1159,2020-03-31 02:55:42,fs2b30,I KNOWWWWW I need to know how someone that beautiful can exist
1160,2020-03-31 02:59:20,fs2b30,"Literally all I could focus on, I have to watch that again lol."
1161,2020-03-31 02:57:18,fs2b30,I definitely thought we were getting acapella BTS when they appeared sitting down and then... LOL but it was still good! hahahah
1162,2020-03-31 03:00:31,fs2b30,Jimin as well.
1163,2020-03-31 00:16:26,fs2b30,I believe it’s just a performance.

1165,2020-03-31 02:13:04,fs2b30,"We did Popeyes DoorDash last week and it never came, we had to submit a complaint to customer service but I just wanted their fried chicken 😭"
1166,2020-03-31 02:16:57,fs2b30,Hahaha I was thinking the same thing! I was kind of like wtf I wanted to hear what he was saying!
1167,2020-03-31 02:18:25,fs2b30,Jinx hahaha
1168,2020-03-31 02:25:59,fs2b30,"Of course, cashing in on those sweet, sweet ratings.

Or maaaaybe they're going through all the other artists fast and leave a little more time for BTS? One can only hope."
1169,2020-03-31 02:31:47,fs2b30,"James tweeted, it's Ben Splatt and the cast of Dear Evan Hansen who will be last"
1170,2020-03-31 02:32:32,fs2b30,we can be dumb together cause same lol
1171,2020-03-31 02:43:03,fs2b30,I hate you I just imagined him singing it
1172,2020-03-31 02:47:17,fs2b30,"They sang this in Stepbrothers too 🤣.  I think Will Ferrell really likes that song, so it was very fitting they were both on the show 😜."
1173,2020-03-31 02:45:47,fs2b30,i'm a puddle. sos.
1174,2020-03-31 03:01:25,fs2b30,You Will Be Found from Dear Evan Hansen!
1175,2020-03-31 03:02:24,fs2b30,"If you don’t know about Dear Evan Hansen, I highly recommend this show. “You Will Be Found” is an anthem."
1176,2020-03-31 03:02:35,fs2b30,Bring LOTS of tissues if you ever go see it. It's an emotional one
1177,2020-03-31 04:20:12,fs2b30,"You Will Be Found from Dear Evan Hansen. Ben Platt who led the singing tonight was the lead in the OBC and won a Tony Award for his performance.

Even better is this [mashup of Found and Tonight from Hamilton](https://youtu.be/7Tivcf-zIOU) which was sung during the March For our Lives concert. Super emotional and moving."
1178,2020-03-31 03:00:53,fs2b30,You will be found from Dear Evan Hansen. Beautiful musical
1179,2020-03-31 03:00:54,fs2b30,You Will Be Found
1180,2020-03-31 03:08:58,fs2b30,It really was!
1181,2020-03-31 03:17:02,fs2b30,A+ flair
1182,2020-03-31 05:39:31,fs2b30,Mine was rowan. I don't know how that was supposed to work.
1183,2020-03-31 03:02:38,fs2b30,"Me too...they also felt a bit somber mood.
BWL is song for Army..maybe that's why they decide that song?"
1184,2020-03-31 02:40:54,fs2b30,my FIRST thought
1185,2020-03-31 18:45:50,fs2b30,"There's a big divide in their energy/how their moods come across. Tae and Jk are figuratively carrying Jimin's torch as far as flirting with the camera goes, and Hobi's face is lit up like a child on Christmas morning. They all look sorta distracted though, like they were really tired. Then again it's probably really hard to just bust out ""stage energy"" on the fly."
1186,2020-03-31 01:47:11,fs2b30,"i would looooove if they did home, for the pun AND it would lend itself really well to a seated intimate performance!!"
1187,2020-03-31 01:33:28,fs2b30,Hoping they perform Home too 🤞
1188,2020-03-31 01:50:53,fs2b30,"HELLO FELLOW BOCELLI FANPERSON 

I also think Home is a real possibility"
1189,2020-03-31 02:22:22,fs2b30,Why?
1190,2020-03-31 02:01:19,fs2b30,She was FAST I am dying.
1191,2020-03-31 02:07:52,fs2b30,can’t confirm but that would make sense!
1192,2020-03-31 02:12:19,fs2b30,"It's pre-recorded. Namjoon's hair was purple during the preview, and his hair's dyed black from Jimin's Vlive a few days back."
1193,2020-03-31 02:22:47,fs2b30,No idea unfortunately!
1194,2020-03-31 02:29:22,fs2b30,Yes please!! I’ll cry so hard (of joy AND pain)
1195,2020-03-31 02:29:58,fs2b30,No 😭😭😭 my heart can't handle that
1196,2020-03-31 02:35:16,fs2b30,Andrea Bocceli is next so they may be last... not surprised but always left to wait lol
1197,2020-03-31 02:58:32,fs2b30,Good night! Hoped it was worth staying up for. Sure was for me!
1198,2020-03-31 03:47:17,fs2b30,"Interesting you mention that... I remember waking up at 4-5 AM when MOTS:7 came out (not sure if that's actually came out but I remember randomly waking up and realizing I could check the new album out at that time) and I experienced something similar. I actually didn't like most of the songs I listened to during that time because, like you mentioned, time felt really distorted and I couldn't grasp what was going on at all. At first I thought they were all like that but it shuffled to one of the Persona songs and I realized that I wasn't perceiving it right. I wonder if there's any research or something about this. (This reply is way longer than I intended, I guess I'm passionate about this... or I really don't want to do my homework)"
1199,2020-03-31 10:53:06,fs2b30,ikr! DST has only started 2 days ago and I can't think. I literally checked qdeoks before going to bed because she had the countdown on her website and I set my alarm accordingly. even just now I had to think what time Run BTS will be released today on my TZ.
1200,2020-03-31 04:07:54,fs2b30,"during a time of needing hope, feeling lost and scared, a show meant to bring togetherness... idk seems like a perfect time for a bside or new track. 

and wanting them to perform songs off their currently promoting album on a broadcast regardless of audience (no audience for ON jimmy fallon) seems less then selfish."
1201,2020-03-31 02:45:48,fs2b30,"Oh my god, spring day. that would make me cry and sing at the top of my lungs"
1202,2020-03-31 02:49:01,fs2b30," 😭  😭  😭 Oh my I don't want to have my hopes up too high, but that would be awesome!"

1207,2020-03-31 03:11:36,fs2b30,I know this actually just made me more worried for them. Like wondering if they're really down about the tour being put off and all this isolation. I'm hoping it's just a somber tone out of respect to the situation and not them being down in spirit. 😥 At least they've been looking well in their vlives.
1208,2020-03-31 03:03:50,fs2b30,I thought they looked sad too. 😟😭
1209,2020-03-31 03:01:09,fs2b30,"Sure cheered us up, we need to do something for then!"
1210,2020-03-31 02:30:38,fs2b30,Justice for WAB:TE!

1212,2020-03-31 02:23:41,fs2b30,People need to keep their expectations low. Everyone is winging it with what they can cobble together. Most of which is NOT professional equipment.
1213,2020-03-31 02:24:45,fs2b30,Ayyyyyy
1214,2020-03-31 02:29:41,fs2b30,Stop right now omg I'd bawl.
1215,2020-03-31 02:31:17,fs2b30,I had orange 😂
1216,2020-03-31 02:36:09,fs2b30,Omg me too. I cheated and just thought of the color Indigo out of nowhere and he still guessed it!
1217,2020-03-31 02:36:15,fs2b30,I had chartreuse 😂😂😂
1218,2020-03-31 02:40:55,fs2b30,Daffodil here.

1223,2020-03-31 02:56:53,fs2b30,"Same, I am so tired but I always make an exception for these boys 😭"
1224,2020-03-31 02:59:50,fs2b30,Hope it was worth staying up for! Sure was for me!
1225,2020-03-31 01:28:55,fs2b30,Omg I would LOVE an unplugged performance! Oh but I also want to see dancing... Maybe some more chill choreography? Ahhhh I just want to see them. I don't care what we get as long as they look happy and are enjoying themselves.
1226,2020-03-31 02:59:55,fs2b30,"I really wanna know too, it looks so cozy😭"

1236,2020-03-31 02:58:30,fs2b30,Looks like it! They’re wearing the same outfits from last week’s recorded covid-19 message.
1237,2020-03-31 02:55:38,fs2b30,*Time to say goodbyeeee*🎶
1238,2020-03-31 02:57:04,fs2b30,That's it! I knew it looked familiar.
1239,2020-03-31 02:59:12,fs2b30,He probably said “for us”.
1240,2020-03-31 02:58:41,fs2b30,I think it was “for us”
1241,2020-03-31 02:59:30,fs2b30,They were asked by James. And he did announce it.
1242,2020-03-31 02:58:43,fs2b30,Yep. He said first. They will do another.
1243,2020-03-31 02:56:04,fs2b30,"Eh, that song is meaningful for Army, but they needed something to appeal to the GP."
1244,2020-03-31 02:55:37,fs2b30,"Oh wait, was that THE jacket? From the airport?"
1245,2020-03-31 01:14:09,fs2b30,Try the other links I just added!
1246,2020-03-31 02:13:26,fs2b30,[This](https://ok.ru/live/1479133372096) has worked well so far
1247,2020-03-31 02:18:27,fs2b30,I switched to the second twitch stream they added and it seems better.
1248,2020-03-31 03:00:46,fs2b30,It was a beautiful way to end the show
1249,2020-03-31 01:46:29,fs2b30,"I think it works out if each artist gets five minutes at least, just depends on how much Corden wants to talk in between"
1250,2020-03-31 01:45:48,fs2b30,What??
1251,2020-03-31 01:58:28,fs2b30,"I don't think so. BTS has been treated well by the show in the past, I don't expect them (or any of the other preformers) to get more then about 5 minutes, but that is fair considering the amount of people they need to fit in."
1252,2020-03-31 02:13:01,fs2b30,"It most likely is, a little chat and a song the same as Legend, but it’s a treat for us to see them in any case!"
1253,2020-03-31 02:12:55,fs2b30,With that many performers it's kinda possible :c
1254,2020-03-31 02:24:12,fs2b30,"Wait what, who did he play?"
1255,2020-03-31 02:25:04,fs2b30,Was he? I remember seeing him on Modern Family as the Dunphy’s neighbor. His character ironically got into Juliard.
1256,2020-03-31 02:27:00,fs2b30,He was the dude in the later seasons with the really long hair right? The one in new directions?
1257,2020-03-31 02:54:51,fs2b30,There is nothing else.
1258,2020-03-31 02:16:27,fs2b30,the second twitch stream doesn't mute!! :) (I also went on a stream search when they muted :x)
1259,2020-03-31 02:16:22,fs2b30,Alright phew we're back to him singing I'm good to go lol
1260,2020-03-31 02:57:18,fs2b30,i think it was intentionally supposed to be casual and shieee because the other performers were the same. except bocelli maybe.

1262,2020-03-31 02:59:21,fs2b30,"It was a fun little thing, I'm not that surprised but I thought they did really good!"
1263,2020-03-31 02:58:05,fs2b30,Damn
1264,2020-03-31 09:09:55,fs2b30,Did you mean has been writing because it's almost like a trope in the fandom 🤣
1265,2020-03-31 02:57:40,fs2b30,Yeah I wasn't expecting it at all lol
1266,2020-03-31 05:02:26,fs2b30,Hahahaha she really does

1268,2020-03-31 04:47:02,fs2b30,Another baby army here. 🙋‍♀️ I started after the grammys
1269,2020-03-31 03:03:53,fs2b30,"I did too! It was very *him*,  but if I’m honest I’d like it even if he was wearing a trash bag (he’d make it work)"
1270,2020-03-31 02:04:22,fs2b30,Thank you! 💜
1271,2020-03-31 02:05:40,fs2b30,Thank you 😌
1272,2020-03-31 02:04:11,fs2b30,Thank you! 💜
1273,2020-03-31 02:03:59,fs2b30,Hey!!! Glad I’m not the only newbie 💜💜💜
1274,2020-03-31 02:03:20,fs2b30,Thanks so much! So far everyone has been so sweet 💕
1275,2020-03-31 02:59:17,fs2b30,"the quality of the stream that i had on wasn't so good, so i was squinting for a good whole minute 😂"
1276,2020-03-31 02:57:46,fs2b30,idk why but this fact is killing me [softly](https://pa1.narvii.com/6670/d01293fed5d4b91dd6f8429b3e66e166362c8acd_hq.gif).
1277,2020-03-31 03:06:48,fs2b30,Same. Her Physical ft. Hwasa is a total bob.
1278,2020-03-31 02:22:30,fs2b30,I didn’t know so I did a quick google search. It says she was homeschooled
1279,2020-03-31 02:49:48,fs2b30,Thank you!💜
1280,2020-03-31 03:28:50,fs2b30,"Yeah, something to lift spirits up instead of “showing off” their skills. I guess the objective matters. If the objective wasn’t really to draw in a whole lot of new fans but at the same time not turn off first time watchers either who may still be really puzzled by korean acoustic singing , then BWL makes sense. It’s chill, it’s positive it won’t turn people off too much but it might not draw in new fans either."
1281,2020-03-31 03:26:17,fs2b30,Yeah I was thinking something like Armypedia but Ionno we fans love that stuff from them but maybe they don’t feel that alone is attractive enough for gp yet? Who knows :/
1282,2020-03-31 18:23:01,fs2b30,"Performing Home for Homefest? I wish, it makes too much sense lol. But maybe that song is hard for them to perform. There's only one performance of it and some bits of it sound off key to me."
1283,2020-03-31 03:21:22,fs2b30,unexpected for me too hahaha. BUT whats new lol I'm used to getting clowned.
1284,2020-03-31 03:22:32,fs2b30,haha look at [his expressions](https://twitter.com/jintermission/status/1244823692795727872?s=20). He was really into it and unexpectedly cheery in comparison to the rest haha. MAYBE IT WAS HIS SUGGESTION
1285,2020-03-31 03:56:31,fs2b30,Yes great performance by Namjoon
1286,2020-03-31 03:22:47,fs2b30,"I think the show wanted them to do something upbeat and with a choreo though, I don’t believe they had a say in this. The show needed variety, not just a bunch of stripped down performances. It’s a pity but it’s how it goes."
1287,2020-03-31 03:17:25,fs2b30,I'm thinking of other alternatives but the only one I can think of is MIR which so many fans would have hated. Plus they probably wanted to do something with some kind of choreo because thats their universal selling point to gp if you know what I mean? An acoustic rendition of a b side will work well with us fans but might not be attractive to GP. Personally I was expecting something real cool and different but after seeing other performances that might have stood out too much and they probably wanted to play it safe.
1288,2020-03-31 03:19:49,fs2b30,"It's OK, but quarantine doesn't mean you have to be angry and sad 24/7 (it can't mean that, otherwise we're screwed) so an uplifting song is actually a good choice if you think about it that way :)"
1289,2020-03-31 02:05:10,fs2b30,Hoods like that are the best tbh. Definitely typical comfort wear hahaha
1290,2020-03-31 03:04:18,fs2b30,"plus aren't we all practicing social distancing. don't know how cool it would be for them to be all dolled up for this when the stylists should avoid as much as they can to get close to the boys in this environment. basically, if you don't need contact, just avoid it."
1291,2020-03-31 02:03:55,fs2b30,omfg yessss! work lunchtime hangs with bangtan is truly living hahaha
1292,2020-03-31 02:20:26,fs2b30,[removed]
1293,2020-03-31 02:22:17,fs2b30,shes young so im not gonna be too harsh but she's definitely gonna look back and cringe
1294,2020-03-31 02:05:19,fs2b30,"I been watching old concerts from her web lately, she's so awesome 💜"
1295,2020-03-31 02:30:55,fs2b30,I was like... Come Back Home?? That’s one I haven’t heard in so long but it fits!! Then I started getting mad at the spoilers... then I realized it was not a spoiler at all hahaha
1296,2020-03-31 07:19:31,fs2b30,Yes we do!!
1297,2020-03-31 07:08:10,fs2b30,Damn I didn't even notice! Gotta rewatch now ha!
1298,2020-03-31 07:19:09,fs2b30,"I think rather than removing it it was more due to Hobi forgetting that tiny detail since they've probably been practicing other songs for this entire time. Another possibility is that it's cause the entire choreo was a more laid back version of what they usually do. So like in the laid back version him turning sharply would be too noticeable when everyone else is so casual? Either way I'm sad to see it go since this is the first BWL performance of the year if I'm not mistaken. 

And yeah RM was really feeling it!  Love. Maybe this is his style then? Makes sense that he's usually more ""concentrated/stressed"" when dancing so when they do a laid back version he's comfortable and gets into it better. Again you love to see it."
1299,2020-03-31 02:21:34,fs2b30,it sounds heavily filtered.. maybe her mic has an effect on it
1300,2020-03-31 02:23:50,fs2b30,it sounds very very filtered. i dont mean autotune i mean an old school muffled effect
1301,2020-03-31 02:21:49,fs2b30,glad my ears arnt playing tricks on me lol
1302,2020-03-31 02:35:51,fs2b30,This has me cackling from my experiences with class through zoom.
1303,2020-03-31 02:43:09,fs2b30,Thank you!!!!!! It's BEAUTIFUL and i need it on my writing playlist 😍😍😍😍
1304,2020-03-31 02:46:05,fs2b30,Thank you!!!!!
1305,2020-03-31 02:03:47,fs2b30,if we get home im crying
1306,2020-03-31 02:08:07,fs2b30,which feels like a year ago
1307,2020-03-31 02:06:54,fs2b30,He had black hair in Jimin's recent vlive.
1308,2020-03-31 02:05:41,fs2b30,oops my mistake so this was prerecorded 👀
1309,2020-03-31 02:12:14,fs2b30,And please cover your face every time you cough and wash your hands often!
1310,2020-03-31 02:20:27,fs2b30,Probably for the best! :////
1311,2020-03-31 02:27:01,fs2b30,The letters on Jimin's sweater are not mirrored though. Hmmm!
1312,2020-03-31 02:57:28,fs2b30,[removed]
1313,2020-03-31 02:59:45,fs2b30,"ehhh, casual sure, nothing really homey about an echo-y sterile practice room 😅 oh well"
1314,2020-03-31 00:26:52,fs2b30,"Hello, fellow british person :D"
1315,2020-03-31 00:45:45,fs2b30,"As a Canadian, I started reading the comment and thought: ""If this isn't the most British thing I've read..."" lololol

Question: does ""half one"" mean 12:30 or 1:30?"
1316,2020-03-31 02:25:04,fs2b30,Would be so beautiful to hear them sing something with Yoongi on piano. 😭
1317,2020-03-31 02:25:33,fs2b30,"Yes! Pretty excited for something like that, their vocals will definitely shine through."
1318,2020-03-31 02:42:57,fs2b30,"Yes, that one! Lol I kept trying to think what performance was that. Man, 2020’s extra long and it’s only March."
1319,2020-03-31 02:43:13,fs2b30,Really hoping for it!
1320,2020-03-31 02:36:42,fs2b30,Gotta keep that audience
1321,2020-03-31 02:37:18,fs2b30,But they arent the last performers
1322,2020-03-31 03:22:45,fs2b30,yeah that’s a better way to put it! I didn’t mean anything negative
1323,2020-03-31 02:58:01,fs2b30,the best part of the entire show was his fit
1324,2020-03-31 02:36:39,fs2b30,"My playlist consists of BTS, Little Mix, Rihanna, Beyoncé, Halsey, Normani, Ariana and BP. Mariah Carey’s entire catalogue."
1325,2020-03-31 02:36:06,fs2b30,"Queens, they deserve THE WORLD but the world doesn't deserve them. 😞 I'm so psyched for their new album!!!"
1326,2020-03-31 02:37:52,fs2b30,Same! It makes me want to drive through the fields of Idaho during sunset or something (maybe I can do in the future if circumstances ever present again)
1327,2020-03-31 02:39:12,fs2b30,Not to mention all the different time zones all the guests are in.
1328,2020-03-31 02:56:53,fs2b30,"Yes but I mean they are still with their hair dyed and hydrated you know? Such fluffy, beautiful hair"
1329,2020-03-31 02:58:38,fs2b30,Right? So comfy uwu
1330,2020-03-31 03:01:26,fs2b30,"I thought the same thing! I was like oh, this is a first 😂 but then nope."
1331,2020-03-31 03:11:40,fs2b30,"Yeah, I should feel bad for them, but I just  find everything about their boredom so cute and hilarious"
1332,2020-03-31 00:48:10,fs2b30,James said it was a chat and a performance.
1333,2020-03-31 02:13:36,fs2b30,"oh I didn't notice that, good catch! so its anyone's guess at this point XD"
1334,2020-03-31 02:19:58,fs2b30,I ordered the 3 piece combo. They said “eff my drink” but got everything else right. I’m about to dig into the Red Beans & Rice.
1335,2020-03-31 02:32:58,fs2b30,Great!
1336,2020-03-31 02:48:05,fs2b30,Haha yes the voice of his generation 😂 how could I forget
1337,2020-03-31 09:07:58,fs2b30,Hehehehe thank you!
1338,2020-03-31 05:50:32,fs2b30,"Basically, he kinda banked on the logical/generalized thinking. 
1. Dessert you'd have at home, but not order at a restaurant.  His example was ice cream so that would make someone think of another option.  The logical choices here are ""pie"", ""cake"", ""cookie"" or ""brownie""
2. Breakfast food that starts with the last letter of that word ""E"".  Pretty much only leaves ""egg""
3. Instrument that starts with the second letter ""g"".  First one that most people think of is ""guitar""
4. Color that starts with 3rd letter ""i "".  Most people would think of indigo (as it's in the spectrum but not a ""basic"" color).

""Magic"" of this type is pretty much just banking on questions that are leading you to the answer they want.  Still was fun to watch though!"
1339,2020-03-31 19:01:54,fs2b30,"Hobi is definitely trying to be our ray of sunshine in this bleak situation. Jimin seemed very reserved until the very end when he was mocking Hobi's peace sign near the end. 

I quite enjoyed the Joon belly flash as well. It's been a long time since we've seen it."
1340,2020-03-31 02:00:56,fs2b30,HE WAS MY FIRST LOVE AND HIS VOICE IS HEAVEN
1341,2020-03-31 02:26:02,fs2b30,"Oh, okay. Thank you!"
1342,2020-03-31 03:00:41,fs2b30,Thanks! It definitely was so good to see the boys again 😭
1343,2020-03-31 03:56:53,fs2b30,"You know, I've felt this as well. When Shadow dropped, I woke up and immediately listened, and I didn't like it at all. Something about it felt really off. After a few hours later, I listened again and realized I loved it. Such a strange sensation now that you mention it."
1344,2020-03-31 03:58:27,fs2b30,"Haha I completely get what you’re saying...sometimes when I’m working out, the songs sound either faster or slower so I think it could be a perception/brain processing thing !"
1345,2020-03-31 11:32:20,fs2b30,"It’s the worse!😭😭

I’m suddenly wondering how the hell is it already afternoon!?"
1346,2020-03-31 04:14:10,fs2b30,"This would be a weird time to do a new track, IMO. It wasn’t a celebratory premiere performance kind of mood. 

BWL makes sense since it’s on MOTS:7 too."
1347,2020-03-31 04:11:14,fs2b30,"Yeah ""little too selfish"" is a bit harsh for people thinking they'd perform a newer song off the album they're promoting."
1348,2020-03-31 04:32:22,fs2b30,"Nope,I disagree.Maybe it makes sense talking about it from our side as an audience,but I'm thinking from the boys side.Yeah Jimmy Fallon had no audience but it would've been not realistically possible to include audiences anyway and not just that,even during their Korean performances there was no audience and they expressed how incredibly sad and meaningless it was for them without ARMYs and how much energy they get from us and now the fact that the tour is also getting postponed(still practicing for it regardless),we know how much it affects them,that's why I felt it was a bit selfish to expect a new bside performance considering that they had no audience at all after album release.Dont get me wrong,I'm not advocating for them to never perform a new song,maybe they'll do an online concert too in the future who knows,but for now it makes sense from their side."
1349,2020-03-31 02:46:27,fs2b30,I’m already just crying thinking about it ahaha
1350,2020-03-31 03:13:07,fs2b30,[removed]
1351,2020-03-31 02:32:03,fs2b30,THIS IS OUR TIMEEEEE
1352,2020-03-31 02:33:56,fs2b30,"Exactly not to mention all performance is from HOME with less equipment  , I'm not expecting it sound like studio live performance at all. Totally strip bare performance with no superficial effect."
1353,2020-03-31 03:04:27,fs2b30,I was internally shouting at him to slow down so I could keep up lol
1354,2020-03-31 02:44:00,fs2b30,THE CHAOS
1355,2020-03-31 02:42:24,fs2b30,i like the way you think
1356,2020-03-31 02:49:01,fs2b30,"There's less people working to maintain the internet service, so it stops working all the time. Still, can't believe this happened when I was watching the livestream"
1357,2020-03-31 03:20:11,fs2b30,Me too! I had a whole host of other cozy plans tonight and I just shoved them all aside 😂 Hope you sleep well!!!
1358,2020-03-31 03:19:16,fs2b30,"It was!!!! I'm really happy it was an earlier time, was much easier to justify 😊"
1359,2020-03-31 02:18:52,fs2b30,"I said this because it was playing in my stream, as much as I would love it, I think they will probably sing one of their more recent songs"
1360,2020-03-31 02:17:51,fs2b30,I know right! 😂
1361,2020-03-31 02:20:50,fs2b30,Thank you!!
1362,2020-03-31 02:34:48,fs2b30,I wish
1363,2020-03-31 02:37:45,fs2b30,Okay. Tnk u !
1364,2020-03-31 03:02:03,fs2b30,"Bocelli was great, wasn't he?! His voice is as amazing as ever. Bocelli & BTS in one night is the best."
1365,2020-03-31 03:00:28,fs2b30,Makes sense
1366,2020-03-31 02:59:29,fs2b30,Oh damn.
1367,2020-03-31 03:02:37,fs2b30,"You have a point, and the performance was enjoyable as usual, so yeah, lol"
1368,2020-03-31 02:14:19,fs2b30,Agreed! I wish they could make one of those at home concerts but any opportunity to see them singing these days is great tbh
1369,2020-03-31 02:25:52,fs2b30,"in the second to last or last season, he was the dude going out with that football player... dont remember any of their names 😂"
1370,2020-03-31 02:29:02,fs2b30,He played Alistair. He had super long hair. I remember him and Sebastian aka Barry Allen aka The Flash hating each other.
1371,2020-03-31 02:29:56,fs2b30,"he sure was, last season. i guess he made an habit of appearing in cringy comedy shows 😂"
1372,2020-03-31 02:31:08,fs2b30,"yep! he was not memorable at all, like all the other newbies 😅"
1373,2020-03-31 02:59:35,fs2b30,"It's too bad they only performed BWL although I always enjoy that song 

Oh well. It's still great seeing them 👏"
1374,2020-03-31 02:23:05,fs2b30,"I think I should be good now but I'll check that one if I need to again, thank you!"
1375,2020-03-31 03:03:33,fs2b30,I'm probably just used to them having their fancy on stage all out performances rather than ones streamed from the dance studio. I guess I'm just spoiled lol
1376,2020-03-31 12:11:48,fs2b30,You're right--- I've definitely seen them when looking at Tumblr😂
1377,2020-03-31 04:48:58,fs2b30,i feel u. Tae's charms are no joke. 😬
1378,2020-03-31 03:06:40,fs2b30,"Oh for sure, Tae can pull almost anything off!"
1379,2020-03-31 02:35:35,fs2b30,"OK, so did she get her G.E.D.?

ETA: I googled. She did at 15."
1380,2020-03-31 03:33:48,fs2b30,"maybe need to consider as well that they might not have much of a say in this and it was decided by the producers of late late show what they want the performers to showcase to fit the theme of the episode, which after watching i personally feel the main aim is  although the situation is sombre they want to instill hopes and uplift people's spirits, esp those who are stuck at home/in isolation

would be weird as hell to do a showstopping performance considering the entire purpose of the ep."
1381,2020-03-31 03:22:47,fs2b30,"honestly this really is me rn 🤡 

could’ve been nice for a morsel of their voices over acoustic though 😭😭😭😭"
1382,2020-03-31 04:40:57,fs2b30,“Let’s do Boy With Love! I’m good at that one!” 😹
1383,2020-03-31 03:24:47,fs2b30,"My issue is that they've already shown BwL in America *a lot*. This could've been used as a opportunity to showcase another side of them because right now they are known to locals as a ""peppy boy band who dances while they sing"" when they could be known for more."
1384,2020-03-31 03:25:51,fs2b30,That's a really nice thought and I'm happy that people are seeing it in such a positive manner! I'm gonna wallow with my ice cream and listen to Mono though
1385,2020-03-31 03:09:50,fs2b30,that’s a really good point!
1386,2020-03-31 02:24:50,fs2b30,Yeah it did sound a bit like a gramophone! but i think it might have just been bad quality
1387,2020-03-31 03:04:53,fs2b30,"No problem! I grew up listening to this song (and his other works) and it’s IMPOSSIBLE for me to not tear up while listening to him, it’s such a beautiful song"
1388,2020-03-31 02:08:36,fs2b30,his selfie last night on weverse had dyed hair tho 👀 i am so confused haha
1389,2020-03-31 02:07:07,fs2b30,actually wait now i'm super confused hahaha
1390,2020-03-31 02:37:06,fs2b30,"Ah, good point. Witchcraft then"
1391,2020-03-31 03:17:02,fs2b30,Ha! I can read your mind. And that's ok!
1392,2020-03-31 00:49:37,fs2b30,1.30. I’ve never considered how that would be confusing to a non-Brit!
1393,2020-03-31 03:20:27,fs2b30,"I know 😢
I’m Glad they weren’t tho. The last performance was beautiful. I don’t know who the was but that song talked to me in this dire times. Kudos to the last performer."
1394,2020-03-31 02:39:01,fs2b30,Me too. I loved LM5. Notice is still my ish. But I’m excited to see what they have in store for us.
1395,2020-03-31 03:03:12,fs2b30,I also really loved what Yoongi was wearing!
1396,2020-03-31 03:07:43,fs2b30,ah yeah! also (related to your og comment) I was thinking it was gonna be at home too and we'd maybe see some BTS pets but alas haha
1397,2020-03-31 03:12:24,fs2b30,Makes them relatable :)
1398,2020-03-31 05:53:39,fs2b30,"Ahhhh I picked s'mores for my first one and I guess it was downhill from there. Thanks for explaining how that was supposed to work, because I'd have never figured that out!"
1399,2020-03-31 03:02:46,fs2b30,I am a new fan but if I do remember correctly we are getting a run ep tomorrow? Idk?
1400,2020-03-31 21:01:38,fs2b30,"yes! well, I'm definitely going to be confused with converting time zones for at least a week 😂 

but I'm rly looking forward for the ""real"" summer, you know, when we can actually go out for hours. things are looking pretty okay in my country of residence so I'm kinda holding out hope here hehe."
1401,2020-03-31 04:23:06,fs2b30,"also why would they want to “debut” a new song on such a stage anyway, if u can even count that as a stage. looking at the other performers they also did very causal/stripped down versions of their most well-known songs so idk why it should be different for bangtan 

i think saying fans are a lil selfish might be too harsh but i do think ppl are being kinda ungrateful considering the circumstances we are in and we could not even get a performance *at all* tbh, so to see ppl being so fixated with the song choice just comes across as lacking perspectives and not knowing how to manage their own expectations 🤷‍♀️"
1402,2020-03-31 04:14:02,fs2b30,selfish woulda been like.. wanting ddaeng 😂
1403,2020-03-31 05:00:04,fs2b30,"i thought they might be doing a stripped down version of maybe black swan or make it right; and from what ppl were saying abt songs (me included), it was all just a fun thing to guess bc we're almost always wrong. I don't think anyone intended it to be anything selfish...just my opinion."
1404,2020-03-31 04:43:41,fs2b30,the boys have brought it up multiple times in weverse and vlives that it affects them greatly to performing to no audiences so idk why people still want them to debut new songs without a single fan in sight gosh. hope people can think of the boys' perspectives too and exercise some empathy for them
1405,2020-03-31 09:10:23,fs2b30,"Thank you, I did ☺️ but I still have to get up this early hahahahahaha"
1406,2020-03-31 02:21:05,fs2b30,"Yeah me too! 

I don't think we would be able to handle queen spring day rn 😭"
1407,2020-03-31 03:05:04,fs2b30,it's really a privilege to hear him in this home setting 🥺
1408,2020-03-31 02:33:28,fs2b30,Same! No idea what they have up their sleeves for the coming weeks so we might get lucky! But we’ll make the most of anything we get! A dose of dopamine :)
1409,2020-03-31 02:26:28,fs2b30,Oh no way!!!
1410,2020-03-31 02:33:37,fs2b30,I remember when I found out I was shook lol
1411,2020-03-31 02:40:30,fs2b30,Well I guess she doesn’t even have school work to worry about then lmao
1412,2020-03-31 03:41:57,fs2b30,"I agree, I noticed all the artists did kinda their most famous, upbeat song. If Dua were there for promotion I’d have expected her to sing her new single, but she stuck with the more well-known Don’t Start Now. I suspect BTS did the same."
1413,2020-03-31 03:50:34,fs2b30,"Yup agree, and that fits in with what I said in another comment about what the ""objective"" of the performance was and for this once, it might not have been about trying to get a lot of new fans."
1414,2020-03-31 03:24:46,fs2b30,Oh 100%. All these interesting suggestions on my timeline😭😭
1415,2020-03-31 03:27:20,fs2b30,"If you look at all the other performances, they were all the well known songs by the respective artists. I don’t think BTS necessarily wanted to showcase something new, rather cater to people at home who just want to enjoy something familiar and comforting. Not saying I wouldn’t have preferred a different song but I understand why BWL was chosen."
1416,2020-03-31 03:29:06,fs2b30,"Mono is such great therapy... Anyway, if you're down and need someone to talk to send me a PM, I'll be glad to chat!"
1417,2020-03-31 02:08:51,fs2b30,I think this whole thing was prerecorded while ago but who knows haha
1418,2020-03-31 00:52:15,fs2b30,"Thanks! That's what I would have guessed, but I know there are some places/languages that do it the other way (12:30), so I wanted to make sure :D"
1419,2020-03-31 03:03:58,fs2b30,"Yoongi in pink is always cute, it suits him well"
1420,2020-03-31 03:11:55,fs2b30,"Imagine BTS in pajamas in their living room, decorated with baby BT21 merch and the Bangtanimals showed up during the performance. WHY DIDNT WE GET THIS."
1421,2020-03-31 05:59:15,fs2b30,"I used the plural “cookies”, and got scrambled eggs, castanets (LOL) and sky blue. I am often an outlier and I wondered where I got off track and it was right at the start!"
1422,2020-03-31 06:12:25,fs2b30,"I had flan, natto rice, accordion, and chartreuse."
1423,2020-03-31 05:58:46,fs2b30,"I've watched too many magic related shows 😂.  This is kind of how TV ""psychics"" work as well... It's all leading questions, planted ideas etc."
1424,2020-03-31 04:58:17,fs2b30,"you HUSH your mouth...wanting ddaeng is never a selfish thing, it's just a carnal instinct we have now lol

edit: whenever ddaeng pops into my mind, spotify is always the word that i associate with it and then i get sad 😂"
1425,2020-03-31 04:15:49,fs2b30,"Even then I wouldn't call it selfish, just naive and adorable 😂 selfish was not the right word"
1426,2020-03-31 05:16:21,fs2b30,"Oh thankyou for being kind,yeah I get what you are saying coz we always try to guess the songs in the live thread,it's always fun but I was just talking about performance of new songs like LTB and from their perspective.I mean even dua performed DSN,not a new one considering she just released her album,that's all."
1427,2020-03-31 03:57:25,fs2b30,i think we need to put things in perspective and realise not everything is about getting new fans. especially in an ep like this.
1428,2020-03-31 03:37:23,fs2b30,omg you're such a sweetheart please always be surrounded by love and positivity
1429,2020-03-31 01:03:52,fs2b30,"On a similar note, do you call the ground floor the first floor like americans do?"
1430,2020-03-31 03:24:35,fs2b30,AAAA that would've been amazing!!! someone contact run or weverse and make it happen!! this is my new dream lmfao
1431,2020-03-31 06:14:54,fs2b30,"I also started with plural ""cookies""! :D (Why would you eat just one)

And went ""cookies"" --> ""smoothie"" --> ""mandolin"" --> ""navy blue"" 

I like your track, too"
1432,2020-03-31 06:14:51,fs2b30,"Your mind, I love it.

I could go for some homemade flan about now, but the natto is all yours."
1433,2020-03-31 06:00:17,fs2b30,"Lol, I tried it out on my husband just now and failed cause he thought of ""peach cobbler""...."
1434,2020-03-31 15:55:08,fs2b30,now would be a perfect time for BH to randomly drop it on spotify and itunes. would literally become the best selling single 😂😂
1435,2020-03-31 06:31:31,fs2b30,"You know there's a way to add a local file to your spotify playlists, right? I have Ddaneg and all their unofficially releases on my spotify"
1436,2020-03-31 01:36:18,fs2b30,"I'd say both are very interchangeable here. I think elevators mostly say ""G"" (or ""L"" for lobby), but I've seen ""1"" used too."
1437,2020-03-31 06:40:30,fs2b30,Outliers for life! 💜
1438,2020-03-31 06:41:17,fs2b30,"Also it’s interesting how it’s blues...indigo, sky blue, navy blue..."
1439,2020-03-31 06:16:08,fs2b30,"Thanks!

I work in a sushi restaurant and all my coworkers make fun of my love of natto. They've actually nicknamed our natto roll the ""stinky slimy bean roll""."
1440,2020-03-31 06:18:41,fs2b30,This thread is making me hungry. I'm still not over the mention of stroopwafels from the other day.
1441,2020-03-31 09:06:53,fs2b30,"Yes! 💜

And I noticed the same thing about all the blues people are mentioning! Many distinct names for varying shades of blue....

...And then out in left field there's our friend u/farawaylightning with ""orange"" 🤣 (I love it 🧡)"
1442,2020-04-06 21:50:29,fs2b30,and here I am NEARLY A WEEK LATER saying I love to deliver the left field nonsense 😂😂💜
1443,2020-04-08 18:34:25,fs2b30,"Lol! And *pssht* — I'm a Queen of Awkwardly Late Responses, myself. 

Besides, time has been up to some *very* suspect things during this plaguetime. I'm leery.

<3"
1444,2020-04-08 18:52:44,fs2b30,"Legitimately I have NO IDEA what day it is anymore. I'm constantly confused. I hope you're staying safe, friend!!! 💜💜💜"
1445,2020-04-12 04:50:09,fs2b30,"Seriously, though!

I mean, I've always kept odd hours, but we're officially in what-the-fuck-even-*is*\-a-day-anymore territory. Like mucking around in a weird time soup. Mmmm.

Gosh, you're a doll! Please do the same and stay safe (and sane\[ish\]) 💜💜💗"
1446,2020-05-02 05:19:47,gbxyu4,"Ben has *such* a distinct voice. It’s in his clear vibrato and the way that he extends held notes to their fullest extent before he needs to breathe for the next phrase of the song. 

Not that Hunter is bad by any means, but he isn’t Ben Platt. I’m surprised Jenny even *tried* to guess Ben; anyone that even remotely knows his voice will know that it isn’t the same voice as the Astronaut."
1447,2020-05-02 02:57:47,gbxyu4,Ben Platt and Skylar Astin because they are amazing singers and astronaut.....is not
1448,2020-05-02 07:05:19,gbxyu4,"Yes! The second she said Ben Platt I was insulted. Ben has one of the most incredible voices I've ever heard and no offense to Hunter Hayes, but he isn't even close."
1449,2020-05-03 04:21:24,gbxyu4,"Honestly this whole show has been getting on my nerves recently. I just finished watching the latest episode and I am SO mad that astronaut went home. In my opinion, Night Angel should have gone home before Banana, and the fact that she is still on here is just blowing my mind. I skip right through her performances because I just cant stand to listen to her. I thought Astronaut's latest (and final) performance was his strongest. I just dont get it."
1450,2020-05-02 07:24:20,gbxyu4,I was really angry at whoever guessed Ed Helms for Banana when Bret Michaels was throwing his voice and didn't sound very good. Ed Helms would win this show if he was on
1451,2020-05-02 05:25:31,gbxyu4,"I know right!! Ur first paragraph is literally why he brings me to tears in DEH. Ben's voice is *distinctly broadway*. U can tell. Whenever Jenny guessed Ben Platt I shouted at my tv ""No! Stop it! Bad panelist, bad!"" 

If I had to compare Ben's and Hunter's voices, I'd say Ben's was strong waterfall. Big, strong, and distinctly his. Hunter's voice is like a little stream. Softer and more warble like, still nice to listen to and just as distinct to him."
1452,2020-05-02 08:25:56,gbxyu4,Edited: I think I got confused. Lol.
1453,2020-05-02 03:16:55,gbxyu4,"Yeah I agree. Ben's voice is so full and smooth compared to Hunter's. No offense to him, but Hunter had a very unique voice."
1454,2020-05-02 05:16:22,gbxyu4,Unique and not at all strong. The worst I’ve ever heard Ben was during that CoVid Concert. Otherwise he’s always been 100%.
1455,2020-05-02 14:53:58,gbw2w6,Fun with Dick and Jane-- yes!! I think i found my feature for today!

1458,2020-04-30 22:24:54,gb48vb,I'd send Ben Platt memes and GIFs in response. Easy and barely any effort required.
1459,2020-04-30 21:22:06,gb48vb,"What’s your relationship with this person? Kinda hard to gauge what to reply without knowing that. Are you guy friends, students, male or female? Are you trying to slide on in there?"
1460,2020-04-30 21:20:37,gb48vb,what kind of reply are you looking to give?
1461,2020-04-30 23:17:41,gb48vb,saw something controversial? My friends all say he looks like a hamster. Or you can send [this video](https://youtu.be/b8CsGKA_VO0) which is pretty funny
1462,2020-04-30 21:47:38,gb48vb,You need to say something that will change the subject

1464,2020-05-01 03:33:10,gb48vb,There’s a Plattonic joke in here somewhere
1465,2020-05-01 03:28:05,gb48vb,"You don't have to reply to this. that seems like a conversation ender to me. I don't know who Ben Platt is but I don't think it matters. most of my text convos end like this nobody ever says ""okay nice taking to you goodbye"""
1466,2020-05-01 19:32:26,gb48vb,Just laugh or exclamation react to the text and don’t respond
1467,2020-09-17 00:55:39,gb48vb,Tell them that he's currently waving through their bathroom window.
1468,2020-04-30 21:12:35,gb48vb,"First of all-how much do you look like him ? 
You can use this to your advantage. Even if you look way diffrent  ;)"

1470,2020-05-01 07:50:53,gb48vb,I woke him up to tell him and he says hi.

1472,2020-05-01 05:23:38,gb48vb,OK

1476,2020-05-01 11:18:20,gb48vb,I went with this one btw. Thanks!
1477,2020-05-01 03:30:38,gb48vb,I love that this is my first exposure to this Ben Platt dude
1478,2020-05-01 03:29:16,gb48vb,That's assuming op wants to continue the conversation

1497,2020-04-29 04:30:33,ga1y45,It's a great genre. I didn't include a lot because one of the other big comments touched on a lot of things I think I'd mention. It was a good list!
1498,2020-04-29 14:03:52,ga1y45,"You are a man of good taste I see! Both top albums from last year, hands down."
1499,2020-04-29 03:47:37,ga1y45,Lol I've heard a lot about Led Zepplin and Dire Straits but never actually listened to a project so thanks.
1500,2020-04-29 14:05:41,ga1y45,Ahhh man I could listen to Little Simz voice all day long. I don't think I will ever get tired of listening to 101fm
1501,2020-04-29 03:51:15,ga1y45,I'll also add Fela Kuti - Gentleman.
1502,2020-04-29 14:31:27,ga1y45,"Me either! She's an underrated GOAT to me. So many good projects under her belt before that album, and then, a fucking masterpiece. Can't wait for the EP she teased the other day. (No preview or anything she just said it's coming on twitter.)"
1503,2020-04-29 02:13:13,ga0ooz,Voodoo - D’angelo

The man is simply outstanding in his lyricism and conceptualization when it comes to albums and just songs in general.

Frank Ocean- Channel Orange, Blonde

Gallant - Ology

They. - NuReligion: Hyena

Sonder (brent faiyaz, dpat & atu) - Into

Mostly rnb but They. Mixes some rap in there as well, their focus is still rnb though. Miguel is also featured on a lot of rap projects so I'm guessing you already heard some hooks or whatever of his.

Someone else already recommended solo brent faiyaz  but the work with his group is also great. I do think the Into album is more of a dark vibe so I would listen to it at a more appropriate time - I think it really stands out if you listen to it at night or when you're driving alone in your car type of mood - but that also depends on how you consume music."

1521,2020-04-29 04:35:49,ga0ooz,"Lol he doesn’t have 10 great albums. Maybe like 5. I personally love his first three albums. Absolutely my favorites from him. Magna Carta was also standout for me.

But you cant go wrong with The Black Album or The Blueprint. Those are critically acclaimed, but again, not my favorites. Every ear is different. See what you like."

I've asked for this multiple times over the years, but we have to rely on third-party blogs with all their nonsense to find this out."

1616,2020-04-22 20:57:01,g67lek,Cool. Can you guys reboot Trailer Park Boys? It went to far off the rails years ago.
1617,2020-04-22 23:41:45,g67lek,Then why don't you know how to spell Patton Oswalt's name?
1618,2020-04-22 21:50:48,g67lek,"can yall please dump some of that reality tv show garbage money into a reality show about engineers solving problems, or better yet bring back junkyard wars?"

1620,2020-04-22 23:19:42,g67lek," ''They'll never give us a direct and easy list of titles that are leaving ''

They used to though, years ago when they were still a new company and it was pretty great. I would actively watch something in my list if I knew it was going soon. I wish they would bring it back, but I get your point about it being bad business for them."
1621,2020-04-23 01:37:45,g67lek,">you can find them quickly enough by goolging, it is a chore though

not a chore if you find a good website, check this sub there are some great websites that keep track of this shit (because the reasons you mentioned)"
1622,2020-04-23 14:50:54,g67lek,But how the internet howls when something is suddenly removed. That’s gotta be worse publicity.
1623,2020-04-23 17:17:51,g67lek,HBO does it.
1624,2020-04-22 22:26:34,g67lek,While I do think the first season does work as a satisfying stand alone. However there is more to the story afterwards in the comics and I'm perfectly happy watching that be translated to the screen.
1625,2020-04-22 22:29:10,g67lek,Lmao I’m with you on that one man
1626,2020-04-23 00:25:24,g67lek,"I used to have every single episode recorded on vhs tape, but I don't have those anymore so I'll probably end up buying it."

1628,2020-04-22 23:49:31,g67lek,They’re going to be on HBO Max here.
1629,2020-04-22 23:03:46,g67lek,I found a complete studio ghibli movie collection torrent that is fantastic quality the other day
1630,2020-04-23 02:02:00,g67lek,"Watched it last week - its in my top 5 movies of all time. Adam Sandler kills it, glad to see him doing well again. The last movie I saw with him was Jack and Jill, so I really thought he was on a downward spiral..."
1631,2020-04-22 21:57:54,g67lek,"I hope there's a moment in the upcoming season where he takes a bite of something, then opens his eyes really wide and finds himself at a loss for words for how to describe what he's tasting."
1632,2020-04-22 21:48:47,g67lek,Yeah.. He makes me laugh.  The calls home are the best.
1633,2020-04-22 21:47:46,g67lek,">You should watch the unbreakable jimmy Schmidt! 

Excellent."
1634,2020-04-22 22:22:30,g67lek,But the show is already on Netflix. An interactive special sounds unappealing
1635,2020-04-23 02:31:59,g67lek,"Don't worry, that won't last *too* long...

At least once they realize that most people don't want to carry a dozen different subscriptions per month at $10-15 each, especially when they have a catalog that's a fraction the size of Netflix, Amazon, or Hulu... 

The real question will be whether they can make more money off subscriptions, at X subscribers, than they could from simply leasing their IP instead..."
1636,2020-04-22 22:45:21,g67lek,So is it US or global?
1637,2020-04-22 22:42:52,g67lek,"Seriously, they only planned five seasons. It’s such a shame they canceled it after three seasons. The last episode of season three was a huge cliff hanger and set up soooo much for the next season. Just give us the last two seasons :("

1675,2020-04-24 01:47:01,g67lek,I knew plenty of people in high school who were into it and they’d do all those creepy ass drawings of anime girls in their notebooks. They were all losers.

1679,2020-04-24 13:05:20,g67lek,How am I stupid? It’s well known that anime consumers are fat neckbearded incels.
1680,2020-04-24 15:36:01,g67lek,"Alright dude, if you're gonna troll you gotta be a little more subtle. Your take is literally ""Cartoons are cool, unless they're from Japan."""
1681,2020-04-24 16:30:58,g67lek,Did I say cartoons are cool?
1682,2020-04-24 17:37:21,g67lek,"You literally said you don't hate cartoons, only anime, because some losers you knew in high school liked anime. That's like saying ""Cats are for assholes, because I knew a kid once who owned a cat and he was an asshole. I've never interacted with a cat before, but it's well known that cats are designed to be pets for people who are assholes."" Like... no one cares that you think anime is for losers, why make your comment in the first place except to be antagonistic?"

1780,2020-06-16 03:34:44,h9vm1k,"If the actor is talented enough they should be able to ACT a certain way, a way that may be different to their own persona. If you can tell they’re a camp gay person and they’re meant to be playing a straight, stereotypically masculine man they’ve done a bad job. This could be said about any bad acting though, not just a gay guy pretending to be straight."
1781,2020-06-16 11:44:17,h9vm1k,"What OP is trying to say ""if an actor can't act, they shouldn't act"""
1782,2020-06-16 03:43:58,h9vm1k,Niel Patrick Harris can play whatever role he goddamn pleases and you’ll like it!
1783,2020-06-16 03:40:49,h9vm1k,"What is being ""obviously gay""?"
1784,2020-06-16 04:51:34,h9vm1k,"I guess I agree that they should portray the character correctly, but what if the character is a straight guy that “acts kind of gay”? 

Like I have known a couple. 

Or like everyone thought Darren Criss was gay but he isn’t- should he not play straight roles too because of his “gay” mannerisms even though he is straight? Tbh I kind of had the reaction you had to Adam Devine (also in Pitch Perfect) but he actually is straight so idk maybe it isn’t as easy to tell ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
1785,2020-06-16 04:51:11,h9vm1k,I agree. I think of glee. The actor who plays Kurt should stick with gay characters but the actor who plays Artie can play straight well. I think the same goes for the reverse where you shouldn’t play gay unless you can act it well.
1786,2020-06-16 04:46:20,h9vm1k,"as a homosexual i agree 100%.

if an actor cant preform the role they are doing because they cant mask their own behaviors for the filming moment they should not play that role."
1787,2020-06-16 08:12:52,h9vm1k,"Yeah I agree. But the alternative isn't true, there should be more gay characters played by masculine guys. It gets really grinding when every representation of us is a complete stereotype that doesn't reflect a lot of us.

Gotta say though, I thought Brent in Being Erica was fucking funny cos he's so clearly gay then it turns out he's basically a womaniser."
1788,2020-06-16 03:36:07,h9vm1k,I agree with that but really they should be bake first act the way the character is supposed to be portrayed.
1789,2020-06-16 04:13:58,h9vm1k,"John Barrowman is extremely gay and in most stuff he does, it kinda comes out a little but in Arrow i think he was great."
1790,2020-06-16 03:46:01,h9vm1k,But he can act as what the character demands so 100% I’ll like it. I love NPH
1791,2020-06-16 03:54:30,h9vm1k,"Maybe movements (i.e. handflicking or other gestures), at least a small lisp, hair or cloths style, etc.

Obviously, just because someone does this doesn't automatically mean they're gay, but these are some things many gay people do."
1792,2020-06-16 04:21:57,h9vm1k,a lisp????
1793,2020-06-16 04:52:02,h9vm1k,"Again, there's a good number of gay people have some sort of lisp. As I've said, this doesn't necessarily mean you're gay."

1805,2020-06-15 01:32:03,h95te5,"So the voice is an instrument like any other. You must learn how to use it. Voice lessons would certainly not hurt you. In fact, a LACK of voice lessons could LITERALLY hurt you if you get into the practice of singing incorrectly. If you are hoping to pursue a career in musical theatre it is crucial to start learning about how to utilize your voice best as soon as you can. From what I have heard, directors would cast a good singer over a good dancer. They’ll cast someone who can take direction (but can’t really be creative in their acting) and can sing but not a great actor who can’t sing. If that all makes sense. In musical theatre just about my personal favorite part is in fact the singing and how the characters are portrayed through the musical dynamics throughout the song. The voice is a very key aspect to character development and everything from an accent to a particular type of vernacular will show the true character. While getting into the meaning of each word in these songs is a little more advanced, you should keep in mind that once you learn to use your voice that is half the battle. The rest is learning how to USE your voice to present the character: putting acting and singing together. A little rant-y but I hope I got my point across!"
1806,2020-06-15 05:34:03,h95te5,"Hi there! Professional musical theatre actress here! Not a dumb question at all.

Even if you aren’t sure if you want to do this as a career, taking voice lessons is a great idea. It’s investing in something you love to do, will teach you healthy singing habits (which are SO important to have if you know you’re going to continue auditioning for musicals) & it will only help you grow your skills and get better! :) So go for it!"
1807,2020-06-15 23:20:03,h95te5,"Maybe not ""critical"". But it will certainly be a huge asset.

In a big venue, half the audience is so far away they can barely see you. Even for minor roles you might find yourself standing out of sight providing backing vocals.

It's all about your voice. If you can't afford lessons, maybe join a social choir group or something like that."
1808,2020-06-26 21:17:29,h95te5,"Yes, but the teacher should allow you to vary your style healthily, like if you are acting in a show like American idiot or spring awakening."
1809,2020-06-15 01:54:17,h95te5,Thanks!
1810,2020-06-15 01:53:26,h95te5,Thanks a lot for this!

Some of my fav moments that really resonated with me:

""Sometimes, I'd feel restless, watching my friends go on far ahead of me. And attempting to keep up with their speed would only leave me breathless. I soon realized that their pace was not my own."" - Jin

""Take your hands off of what you can’t control and get your hands on what you can control. The only thing you can control is yourself."" - SUGA

""There will be times in your life that you question your own decisions, whether it be about your major or your profession."" - J-hope 

“You are the leader of your own life.” - J-hope"

Spring Day has such a special place in my heart (and for so many of us) and it felt so fitting to include for this event. It brings so much raw emotion and warmth and... inspiration too. Motivation. Idk. It makes me sad but it makes me happy and I’m so so so so glad I got to hear them perform it again after all these years. THANK YOU BANGTANNN

1866,2020-06-07 21:05:11,gxm38h,What Sal Khan does on Khan Academy is literally invaluable. Got me through my entrance tests when I went back to college later in life. Dude's awesome.

1873,2020-06-07 23:41:29,gxm38h,"There is this part in Spring day, when Jin sings and abruptly smiles, it does things to my heart. I cannot explain it

Spring day and Microcosmos was lovely. Just a beautiful way to end the show. If lyrics were added it would have been 5X lovelier"
1874,2020-06-07 23:48:07,gxm38h,"it was my first time in a long time being this active and commenting lots online. it's been real fun watching this with the others army and reading your reactions, even though I did not reply that much t.t (I'm shy x.x)

honestly, I came watching this streaming thinking it will be another long, boring and awkward show waiting for bts. however I found myself enjoying this a lot, got inspired by speeches & cried lots haha

the boys were motivating and touching through their speeches. I also needed a slap of reality from yoongs.
as well as the mini-concert omg! they were stunning in those suits, they sounded wonderful and my heart jumped in joy with all the adorableness!! (and just for seeing them perform)☺ 


and spring day my god!!!!!!"
1875,2020-06-07 20:36:26,gxm38h,"Their speeches reflected their individual personalities and voices, all of them so lovely. I started tearing up when Jimin was speaking. It has been a long while since I graduated from anything, but their words are comforting no matter what phase you are at in life - uncertainty and the inevitability of change never stop.

They did well, my heart is purple. 💜"
1876,2020-06-07 23:55:29,gxm38h,I must add.. Kim Taehyung really is something isn’t he. Gosh.
1877,2020-06-07 19:36:34,gxm38h,"Dang, I was expecting YouTube to kinda rush some of these speeches. But if Beyonce's is this long, strong and powerful, imagine Michelle Obama's and BTS's."
1878,2020-06-07 19:36:43,gxm38h,I want Beyoncé’s speech framed on my wall.🥺

1882,2020-06-07 20:33:18,gxm38h,Jimin's speech was so sweet! Also I love Jin so much.
1883,2020-06-07 20:39:04,gxm38h,I thought all their speeches were wonderful but Jin’s speech really resonated with me especially as someone who is afraid of not graduating within 4 years. His words were really reassuring and I just have to go at my own pace :)
1884,2020-06-07 23:32:16,gxm38h,I would like to invite you all to my funeral

1900,2020-06-07 19:22:47,gxm38h,Can Michelle Obama run for president? That would be so powerful
1901,2020-06-07 19:59:48,gxm38h,"This is a very powerful speech. As expected from Michelle Obama, and I hope graduates watching this are absorbing it."
1902,2020-06-07 20:09:13,gxm38h,No matter what your opinion is of the Obamas you cannot deny that Michelle is an amazing speaker.

1907,2020-06-07 20:47:12,gxm38h,"I'm glad they all got to speak. 😊 I love that they brought both comfort and encouragement in their speeches, and that they talked about personal experiences. Would have to watch again but a few things that have resonated with me so far was Jin realizing that he must go on his own pace and Yoongi talking about the things we can and cannot change and to do something about those that we can. 💜 Yoongi's in particular had many ""quotable quotes"" lol

Namjoon's loud cry of pain when Kookie's graduation cap hit him 😂 I can't believe they didn't retake that part or edit it 😂 But it's all cute though.. It's so them 😂

Congratulations, Class of 2020!!! 🎉👏💜💜💜

Edit: so Yoongi's words were actually ""control"" and not ""change"" but I guess it's almost the same in this context 😅"

edit 2 : unless they mean barack obama is lower on the list and so he'll be speaking somewhere around 7pm. which makes bts' appearance 7.30+ ish."

1917,2020-06-07 19:44:00,gxm38h,"Can we get this kind of event every year? Like yeah, maybe people will graduate next year as they normally do, but there are still people who do not get to fully experience moments like this due to personal issues or things like that."
1918,2020-06-07 20:01:37,gxm38h,Michelle Obama's speech is making me so emotional. What an amazing woman! I love you Michelle!!!

I love the Korean and English subs

They'll each give a speech? 😭

1920,2020-06-07 20:21:26,gxm38h,OMG OMG THANK YOU. thank you for letting them speak in Korean
1921,2020-06-07 20:23:20,gxm38h,JIN KEEPING IT REAL. Everyone has their own pace!!

1927,2020-06-07 20:53:40,gxm38h,"I think one of the most amazing things about Dear Class of 2020 is that while we're mostly here for BTS, we get to learn about who some of the other speakers are."
1928,2020-06-07 20:58:48,gxm38h,"Jin's speech hit me the most. We need to realise we need to go at our pace and that's ok. 

Also Namjoon did so well. He spoke so well. English King and his way with words.. just perfect. 

I lost it at the end when the cap hit Namjoon in the face and then he started jumping 😂"

And the joy on their faces as they performed. Mikrokosmos was so light and happy. They really love what they do."

I feel like this performance was so much for ARMY as it was for the graduates. Like they picked all songs that would display how much they love and miss us. And Queen Spring Day coming back? I mean, that's just purely for ARMY."
1933,2020-06-07 23:42:39,gxm38h,"On a lighter note

The contrast between Jimin and Taehyung’s choice of footwear. Hehe never change"
1934,2020-06-07 23:43:08,gxm38h,"The moment I clicked the livestream, they were singing Spring Day and that caught me off guard so much I instantly cried. I was sobbing. It brought me back to the first BTS concert I went to in 2017 as a baby ARMY and it was also during my last semester as a senior in college. Spring Day has such a special place in my heart. I can’t I’m crying again 😂😭"
1935,2020-06-07 23:46:26,gxm38h,Ah as soon as I heard Spring Day I teared up uuugghhhh that was so nice I’m happy with their song choices and it was great seeing them be happy

1937,2020-06-07 23:58:42,gxm38h,Were they *trying* to make us cry by choosing Spring Day and Mikrokosmos????
1938,2020-06-07 23:58:59,gxm38h,"Ok I watched the performance again and I‘m loving VMin creating chaos and clowning everyone. Performing when there is no one physically present to watch other than staff? That can’t be easy. Bless VMin for trying to put smiles on everyone’s faces and make it fun.

Also I look forward to seeing new army on this sub that will say “I discovered them because of that YouTube 2020 graduation special” :)"

Wonderful words. So proud."
1950,2020-06-07 20:46:55,gxm38h,"Beautifully done. Their speeches were very individually them and from heart.  Beyoncé and Michelle Obama as well. Powerful words.

Honestly, I’d take this kind of graduation a bazillion times over rather than having to sit on metal bleachers in the hot sun."

1955,2020-06-07 23:34:48,gxm38h,"You can see how happy they are to get to perform, even if it's not live. I love them singing along to all the parts.

1964,2020-06-07 19:48:43,gxm38h,"I graduated years ago (lol) but the emotions I have now watching this are still the same when I sat there listening to guest speakers telling us to follow our dreams, to accept that we will fail, to embrace the losses as much as the successes, to be brave and bold and take risks...

But the speeches here are so much more powerful, more inclusive, more reality-based than the usual ""you'll make it, don't worry!"" These words are what everyone needs to hear and absorb right now.

I'm listening to Michelle Obama speak now and it's hitting really different. I don't know how I'll be by the time BTS speak.

EDIT: 

""Treating people right will never ever fail you.""
- Michelle Obama."
1965,2020-06-07 19:56:28,gxm38h,"Gosh, between Beyoncé’s and Michelle Obama’s speeches (especially pretty much being back to back), it’s already been a very touching stream. 

I felt so much listening to them. They really know how to deliver speeches and hit home."
1966,2020-06-07 19:57:33,gxm38h,Michelle Obama talking about anger reminds me of Bang PD feeling angry about the music industry. He's definitely striving to become a better label.

Hey Taejin, STOB IT. My heart can't handle their cuteness.

Yoongi copying Tae's moves but he danced it in tiny. lol"

1989,2020-06-07 19:20:00,gxm38h,Like a regular grad ceremony this graduation thing is also gonna last about 5 hours. As Mrs. Obama said at least it doesn't require everyone to be in the heat.

2005,2020-06-07 20:25:52,gxm38h,That ending was so typical Yoongi loool
2006,2020-06-07 20:29:59,gxm38h,Taehyung please my heart cant handle it
2007,2020-06-07 20:41:59,gxm38h,Jimin almost made me cry into my bowl of Cheetos :(
2008,2020-06-07 20:44:09,gxm38h,"I am rewatching the bangtantv one now

Namjoon really pointed at Hobi for hope awwwwwwww"
2009,2020-06-07 20:47:53,gxm38h,"Sundar pichai mentioning BTS I'm proud as a fellow Indian LOLOL (don't ask me, that's what you're proud about?)"
2010,2020-06-07 20:49:01,gxm38h,"Everytime they say BTS or they put it on the screen... man, that's a lot.
I am glad everybody is accepting a great part of this generation is shaped by artists and people like BTS.
I know I do and I am glad my students will take away great things from their message, the same things I am trying to instill in them- self love, hard work, compassion, emphaty. Because I do believe these are going to bring the change we are all awaiting."
2011,2020-06-07 20:55:31,gxm38h,Jin's speech really stuck with me. And Jimin's is like a warm blanket.
2012,2020-06-07 21:00:36,gxm38h,"I might be showing my age, but ugh I always had a crush on JGL when I was younger."
2013,2020-06-07 23:02:50,gxm38h,"I'm still thinking about Seokjin's words after all this time: 

>If any of you feels lost in the face of doubt or uncertainty, or the pressure of starting anew, don’t rush. Take a deep breath. You may find that any moment can be turned into an opportunity. Allow yourself to take it easy. Take it one step at a time. You might discover the important things you were missing, and they will reach out to you. 

I'm just wrapping up two weeks of furlough and I'm going back to my full-time job for three weeks before they terminate my contract. My husband and I have saved up enough money to last us about four months, which is amazing. But I fear it's going to be a while before the market opens back up for my work (I'm a technical writer)  in my state. So I'm just worried. But I'm trying to find moments of grace for myself."
2014,2020-06-07 23:05:32,gxm38h,The commencement ceremony wouldn't be complete without Firework lmao. Back in my day we had that [Vitamin C song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foyAOoVagWw)
2015,2020-06-07 23:13:16,gxm38h,"Those splits, I'm speechless. On another note, this gives me a lot of hope for how long BTS' block will be!"
2016,2020-06-07 23:14:27,gxm38h,What if the boys do a medley performance of their songs!?! 😱 and not JUST bwl....🤞🏽
2017,2020-06-07 23:14:39,gxm38h,Lmao SAVAGE reminds me of all of the twitter  edits of Jimin being a bad bitch 😂🙌🏼
2018,2020-06-07 23:25:40,gxm38h,GOOD The locals deserve to hear this. I only wish there were lyric subtitles too so they could get the full extent of it
2019,2020-06-07 23:31:49,gxm38h,Jin doing his little dance in the background I'm cryinnnnnnnn

2022,2020-06-07 23:34:02,gxm38h,Did anybody correctly predict that set list? I feel like they just ambushed us.
2023,2020-06-07 23:34:33,gxm38h,Spring Day and Mikrokosmos really gave off that post hat throw moment where you’re looking for all your friends and family in the crowd and crying. 😭😭😭😭
2024,2020-06-07 23:45:05,gxm38h,I literally screamed oh my god when spring day came on and my parents thought something bad happened lmao
2025,2020-06-07 21:00:50,gxm38h,"Much appreciated the speed with which this was put up on Bangtan tv and I’m really happy to see that everyone got to talk. Each boy has a different story to tell and relates in different way to fans, so it was fantastic they got to speak and do so in their language, so as to fully be able to express themselves.

Namjoon, Seokjin, Yoongi, Hoseok, Jimin, Taehyung & Jungkook, thank you for being a beacon of good in the dark world 💜


Class of 2020, times are tough and all may look bleak but you have the strength in you to realise your dreams and to be the change you want to see in this world 💜


@mods I don’t think we should remove the Bangtantv thread. That video is superstar enough to warrant its own post and it lets people better discuss and express themselves."
2026,2020-06-07 21:01:37,gxm38h,"All their speeches were lovely, but Seokjin really touched my heart ♥"

I was pleasantly surprised that they each told a little anecdote; that was really personal & touching

(Goes without saying, but they look amazing, too)"
2060,2020-06-07 20:34:03,gxm38h,"So nice to see them, I’ve missed them. I know we’re drowning in FESTA content right now, but just to see them speaking sincerely like that has done something to my heart 💜"
2061,2020-06-07 20:35:34,gxm38h,"Ahhhh they were great! They all kept it real but hopeful, which is exactly what we need. Hobi's especially struck me, and Jimin just has this warmth and caring in his words that is very sincere. I'll definitely need to listen to this again! Thank you Bangtan. 💜"
2062,2020-06-07 20:35:46,gxm38h,I’m so glad they all got to speak and tell their own stories.😊
2063,2020-06-07 20:40:25,gxm38h,"Alright Colin said some nice, practical things. As an SNL fan and army it's another small win to see him go after them. 

Now that BTS has spoken and there's some time before the performance, it's time for a food break.  🔥"

2082,2020-06-08 00:32:11,gxm38h,"You ever been in possession of one (1) fact that you can't stop telling everyone? There's a popular tweet going around right now claiming Spring Day was last performed in 2017. After performances at year-end award shows and JPN fanmeetings, we saw her twice more: [180622 @ Lotte Family Concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbpjUT2MdhM) and 180707 @ SBS Super Concert in Taipei.

I'm glad we didn't quite suffer two whole years without her. 😭"

I really really liked the speeches and I can almost visualize the meeting when they were writing these speeches. Jin and JK's struck me for some reason, but I am still processing my thoughts. 

Much love, Bangtan."

When they are on ""mainstream"" programmes, in the back of my mind, I'm always wondering how locals will react to them? Are they coming across well? What will someone seeing them for the first time think? It makes me a bit nervous - am I the only weirdo that thinks like this? What's wrong with me? 🤦🏼‍♀️😂"
2114,2020-06-07 21:23:47,gxm38h,"I love how all their speeches are so different so they can resonate with different sorts of people and what they may be going through. Some people resonated with RM’s, JK’s, Jin’s, Suga’s, Jimin’s, and Taehyung’s the most. I personally felt most connected to J-Hope’s words. I love how all their words can inspire all sorts of people with different and tough times they might be going through. The ending was the cutest as well and topped everything off very nicely. No bias here, they were the highlight of the stream for me so far."

2469,2020-06-07 23:02:48,gxm38h,Loll My neighborhood just started cheering right during the tassel flip. (The 7pm cheering for healthcare workers in NYC)
2470,2020-06-07 23:03:00,gxm38h,TIL the tassel is there for a reason. I thought it was just a decoration everyone agreed on or something :P
2471,2020-06-07 23:03:01,gxm38h,I MAY have just grabbed my tassel (which is hanging in my room) and pretended that this was my graduation haha

2499,2020-06-07 23:31:00,gxm38h,I love that they look like they are genuinely enjoying themselves!

2501,2020-06-07 23:31:15,gxm38h,"They're about to snatch everybody with this performance. How can you not love them, really?"
2502,2020-06-07 23:31:28,gxm38h,"Jimin really sounds so good, wow 

(Ofc they all do, but I’m always really excited for his strong vocal performances)"
2503,2020-06-07 23:31:59,gxm38h,I honestly thought they would perform all hype songs but I'm glad people can really listen to their vocals through these songs!! 💜
2504,2020-06-07 23:32:24,gxm38h,I STAND HAPPILY CORRECTED ON MY SONG PREDICTIONS EARLIER
2505,2020-06-07 23:33:22,gxm38h,They're being silly and having so much fun!
2506,2020-06-07 23:33:28,gxm38h,That was beautiful 🥺🥺
2507,2020-06-07 23:33:55,gxm38h,Jimin’s microphone switching colors 🤣
2508,2020-06-07 23:34:03,gxm38h,I loved loved loved this!!! I’m so happy they performed songs that I didn’t expect them to perform. Perfect song choices!
2509,2020-06-07 23:34:19,gxm38h,Bang Bang Con can't get here fast enough. Omg.
2510,2020-06-07 23:34:33,gxm38h,Nooo come backk 😭😭😭😭😭
2511,2020-06-07 23:35:34,gxm38h,Well that was super fun. Really missed this. Love and self love for everyone!
2512,2020-06-07 23:40:26,gxm38h,I wonder how many people watched the event 🤔
2513,2020-06-08 00:06:13,gxm38h,"This performance way way beyond my expectations. It was my dreammmm for them to perform spring day and I cannot believe they actually did!! (They were trying to make each other laugh the entire song while I was sobbing listening to SD, typical)

I wasn’t 100% sure if Bangbangcon was going to be worth it, but after this, I’m looking forward to it so much! I miss seeing the dorky boys do cute interactions with each other during their performances, it felt almost like watching a real concert 😭💜"
2514,2020-06-08 00:50:31,gxm38h,"This is probably one of my favourite performances by them, and these aren't even my top Bangtan songs. I just love how comfortable and happy they seemed, I had the silliest smile on my face the whole time just by seeing them enjoy themselves and be so playful 🤗"
2515,2020-06-08 03:17:13,gxm38h,I loved their performance!!! Love love love it!! I waved my arms out of instinct when they started singing. Loved how Spring Day was like YOU THOUGHT I WAS GONE?
2516,2020-06-08 03:36:19,gxm38h,"I woke up just went the final graduation party segment started with Katy Perry. Love that the last two performances were non-English too, something you would never see even 5 years ago  

Loved BTS' performance too, and Spring Day was sooo good. Loved that they sat down and did a chill version of the song. Mikrokosmos had the same energy as the Airplane Pt2 Festa 2020 version. Was expecting to see RM picking up objects in the background, so luckily they were outside the museum during that performance, lol"
2517,2020-06-08 04:34:40,gxm38h,"That performance of Spring Day was...everything. Beautiful vocals, beautiful people, and...they looked SO HAPPY???"
2518,2020-06-07 19:19:26,gxm38h,This isn't applicable to the people who don't have good parents :/ Feel bad for those graduating with no one to cheer them on.
2519,2020-06-07 20:27:20,gxm38h,Hoseok our hope our sunshine
2520,2020-06-08 01:09:46,gxm38h,"Their performance,vibe,energy,outfits, background choice etc were all beautiful and very good just like the song choices. 

But did anyone else notice how most of their singing was lipsyncing or dubbed?? And im not saying that to criticize them because we all know they can sing,im just wondering why. They even made it obvious themselves when they lowered the mic before the sentence finished in many instances. 

BWL felt like it was 100% playback and then in Spring day it felt like they were singing but some parts were obviously dubbed/playback and almost all Mikrokosmos was the same. 

It was also one of the very rare instances that even the rap parts were playback that are live even in the music shows that they re using louder backing track than live shows and you usually cant hear their love vocals clearly. Im just wondering why did they do that? Maybe the set didnt allow very good sound or smth like that but I dont know seems weird."

2631,2020-06-07 23:58:00,gxm38h,"Can I just say all of their voices sounded so smooth, maybe its because I haven't heard them live in a while. Also jin really came for my heart during the performances with his facial expressions and cute dances during mikroksomos"

2635,2020-06-07 22:56:52,gxm38h,"That's a nice idea Mr Obama, but showing my dad his conspiracy theory news is false isn't gonna change his mind. People who believe this stuff don't listen to logic, they need mental help :/"

2927,2020-06-07 23:22:54,gxm38h,I freaked out when I heard that oahh oahh oahh oaahhh. Will always hold a special place in my heart
2928,2020-06-07 23:23:01,gxm38h,Just logged on in time and man I forgot how much I hated BWL suits 😂😂 Hobi’s looks good though.

2973,2020-06-08 09:51:44,gxm38h,"So late to the party but this was absolute perfection! It was so good to see them all again looking so happy while they perform for us. Spring Day was a very nice surprise, thank you boys.

Also, it's been almost 2 decades since I graduated from college but I feel comforted by their message. It's been a rough couple of weeks but today was just amazing. I'm letting my kids watch their speech on their graduation day, that's for sure."
2974,2020-06-07 23:37:55,gxm38h,"No. 463 in questionable style choices, kept wondering which would happen first, Tae tripping over his tassels or whipping them in someone's eyes lol. His shirt also looked like someone glued crepe paper and feathers to it, but I guess I'm no judge of fashion XD I'm also now in need of Jin's jumper, it's just my style."
2975,2020-06-07 23:09:12,gxm38h,I hadn't heard Megan before but I'm bopping

2978,2020-06-07 20:56:14,gxm38h,This reminds me of when me and my cousins would act out random alien planet adventure stories pretending to be people. lol what is going on lol
2979,2020-06-07 21:26:48,gxm38h,Lol
2980,2020-06-07 21:34:15,gxm38h,I still need to see euphoria!!

2987,2020-06-07 23:20:26,gxm38h,"Super excited to wait for BTS! Am I too crazy to hope for a live performance since theirs is the last act? I know there were screenshots of possibly recorded performance, but still...

&#x200B;

P.s So is this CNCO also a Fila ambassador? ~~Or are they also Army or something, with the 7 cap and all.. I like the songs btw!~~ (Apparently not)

&#x200B;

P.s.s okay it's kinda strange seeing the beginning of Boy With Luv without the fanchants!! Too lonely when it was just my voice :p"
2988,2020-06-07 23:20:33,gxm38h,"Oh, that red hat dude is OT7, too"
2989,2020-06-07 23:20:49,gxm38h,thanks to all the telenovelas I had to watch when I was younger I can understand more than a third of the lyrics now lol
2990,2020-06-07 23:21:06,gxm38h,Ahhh I'm not readyyyy
2991,2020-06-07 23:21:07,gxm38h,This probably won't happen because they have choreo but it would be so cute if BTS sang in their dorm
2992,2020-06-07 23:21:12,gxm38h,Ahhh bts
2993,2020-06-07 23:21:15,gxm38h,IT'S HAPPENING

3031,2020-06-07 23:14:21,gxm38h,"No offense or anything, but is this appropriate? Maybe I'm too boomer to understand.

Edit: I'm not trying to say it's bad, y'all. It's great, but just ain't my thing."
3032,2020-06-07 21:21:59,gxm38h,Has she had a stroke? :/
3033,2020-06-07 20:53:33,gxm38h,I already graduated. But all the quotes you mentioned really resonated with me as well. Gonna save your comment. ☺
3034,2020-06-07 20:37:08,gxm38h,At 5.30 am in Korea!! Gotta admire the dedication xD
3035,2020-06-07 20:38:51,gxm38h,It was probably uploaded privately and the intern was waiting to click the publish button. Lololol
3036,2020-06-07 23:54:36,gxm38h,I wholeheartedly agree. I feel like I’m on cloud nine right now. Just seeing their smiley happy faces is everything. Gosh I’m so whipped for them.
3037,2020-06-07 20:32:04,gxm38h,He looked so good
3038,2020-06-07 20:34:21,gxm38h,Same ☠️
3039,2020-06-07 20:35:05,gxm38h,Same! Have to go back and read what he actually said.
3040,2020-06-07 20:35:58,gxm38h,"I swear I couldn’t concentrate on the first seconds,"
3041,2020-06-07 16:59:56,gxm38h,It's so surreal and I'm so proud of them 😭😭😭😭😭
3042,2020-06-07 20:29:34,gxm38h,I wish someone had told me that before I went to uni 😪
3043,2020-06-07 20:34:44,gxm38h,Jin’s speech was so real and so comforting.
3044,2020-06-07 22:59:56,gxm38h,"The Portland protests have had leadership that is consistently reminding them that the protests are great and they're glad everyone showed up, but without political action also, it's not going to be effective. People have to vote. I love seeing young people get on board with it."
3045,2020-06-07 23:40:45,gxm38h,THANK YOU BANGTAN 😭😭😭😭😭
3046,2020-06-07 17:43:22,gxm38h,Ugh I just moved from NY to Seoul and now a bitch is up all night again... 4am to 8am here we goooo
3047,2020-06-07 17:18:38,gxm38h,Ugh I know. Even watching them on James corden is a stretch for me.
3048,2020-06-07 18:58:14,gxm38h,congratulations to you!
3049,2020-06-07 20:33:59,gxm38h,This speaks to me like nothing ever did!
3050,2020-06-07 20:32:24,gxm38h,Same thoughts running through my head.
3051,2020-06-07 20:39:03,gxm38h,"I blocked him out. He can’t ruin my joy lol. Make questionable choices now, deal with the consequences later 🤣"
3052,2020-06-07 20:37:45,gxm38h,I've broken every rule of his Credit Card rules in recent years. LOL. I'm just selective listening so I don't get my feelings hurt.
3053,2020-06-07 21:32:46,gxm38h,RIP K-armys or any other non-English speaking fans just waiting for bts and having every one of their suspicions about Americans confirmed. 🤣
3054,2020-06-07 22:49:06,gxm38h,I took for granted having a president that could form coherent thoughts 😭
3055,2020-06-07 22:47:16,gxm38h,I miss him so so much.
3056,2020-06-07 23:33:25,gxm38h,me and you both 💜
3057,2020-06-07 23:52:54,gxm38h,There was something ff when the fan chants for BWL were missing. I got so used to the screaming crowd it just felt so empty without it for a upbeat song like BWL.  No oh my my my sung with the crowd.
3058,2020-06-07 23:52:10,gxm38h,why can't we post the video onto the subreddit?
3059,2020-06-07 19:54:53,gxm38h,Well...since the Obamas I guess?
3060,2020-06-07 19:56:42,gxm38h,Yep I suddenly want UGH in the background of her speech 😊
3061,2020-06-07 23:36:49,gxm38h,"I literally gasped when I heard the whining noise and was like 'OH MY GOD WHAT!' and my husband just blank stared at me like I was high and I was like 'just go back to reddit, honey, it's ok.'"
3062,2020-06-07 23:44:28,gxm38h,It's a such a GIFTTTT getting to see Queen performed! For all recent army
3063,2020-06-07 23:53:03,gxm38h,This!!!! He sounds so soft😍
3064,2020-06-08 00:05:57,gxm38h,Yessss he wasssss!! Congrats on recognising 🥰🥳🥳
3065,2020-06-07 20:35:54,gxm38h,and the gummy smile made an appearance! what a gift!
3066,2020-06-07 20:58:21,gxm38h,That's smile always do something nice to me...no matter what...I will never get enough of it🥰
3067,2020-06-07 20:33:39,gxm38h,"lmao SAME, and Jin's speech about going at your own pace made me tear up cause it hit so close to home."
3068,2020-06-07 23:41:04,gxm38h,I legit cried for the first time since becoming an ARMY. I missed them so much and things are so icky right now that this all just hit so hard and I just cried tears of joy.
3069,2020-06-07 23:51:27,gxm38h,"Right? I wanted 2 more songs. What the hell. A full blown concert. If only . 
If the BangBangcon concert will be like this then it was money very well spent."
3070,2020-06-07 22:54:00,gxm38h,Can't believe we got two presidential speeches in one day!
3071,2020-06-07 20:37:16,gxm38h,"Yes, they both brought tears to my eyes but for different but overlapping emotions."
3072,2020-06-08 00:06:02,gxm38h,OMGGGG
3073,2020-06-07 21:39:07,gxm38h,Same. I’m watching the ones I want to see but the other times i’m on my phone reading comments on this ~~love~~ live thread. Lol
3074,2020-06-07 21:42:48,gxm38h,YES I couldn't agree more! I just thought this too; like it feels like it should be 4 a.m. for an award show just waiting for the final bit.
3075,2020-06-07 21:39:14,gxm38h,Feels good.
3076,2020-06-08 02:04:35,gxm38h,Taehyung was really in his element! His facial expressions stole my heart
3077,2020-06-07 20:13:41,gxm38h,Every coming up announcement has had them. They know who is watching 😂
3078,2020-06-07 20:13:44,gxm38h,Aww I saw that and got excited but I legit JUST tuned in.
3079,2020-06-07 20:39:33,gxm38h,I noticed that too. Is that a Korean thing or not? I’ve heard other Korean speakers do that before.
3080,2020-06-07 21:28:27,gxm38h,It's honestly mind-blowing the way fans have mobilized to match the donation. Many fans have been donating since last week and they're still donating and promoting the donation drive on social media
3081,2020-06-07 21:27:47,gxm38h,I love army so much
3082,2020-06-07 21:43:36,gxm38h,Their friendship cracks me up. You know Martha grows the BEST weed and sends it to Snoop along with an apple pie.
3083,2020-06-07 21:44:51,gxm38h,That was no mistake for sure. I love those two together.
3084,2020-06-07 23:36:47,gxm38h,I remembered your comment when I saw them start performing! I can't believe he spoiled ANOTHER thing
3085,2020-06-07 23:38:57,gxm38h,"I think I read and liked your replay today! Bless you, you have golden fingers, keep on typing beautiful things like that into existence!"

3087,2020-06-08 00:11:27,gxm38h,This!!!
3088,2020-06-07 20:45:08,gxm38h,"I completely agree. I am far past graduations but even as a professional “adult,” so much of what they said resonated. 💜💜"
3089,2020-06-07 23:57:11,gxm38h,He was REALLY in his element tonight
3090,2020-06-08 00:04:22,gxm38h,"I’m really falling in love with his whole vibe. He makes everything look and sound so effortless. His dancing especially. I can’t even explain it. 

Those shoes tho..."
3091,2020-06-08 00:02:24,gxm38h,I wonder how many locals had their heart snatched by him
3092,2020-06-08 00:06:43,gxm38h,I got Tae wrecked hard today!!! He was killing me with everything today. Just
3093,2020-06-08 07:07:30,gxm38h,Dude. Yes. The man had swagger tonight.
3094,2020-06-07 19:37:37,gxm38h,Same!
3095,2020-06-07 19:39:19,gxm38h,Omg yes
3096,2020-06-07 20:34:11,gxm38h,Yep. Hearts were def snatched.
3097,2020-06-07 20:32:54,gxm38h,I ended up hugging my pillow so hard. Lmao
3098,2020-06-07 20:45:31,gxm38h,"There's a saying that graduating in 4 years is like leaving a party early. 😉

It took me more than 4 yrs but taking that extra time took tons of pressure off my shoulder and that last year was seriously the best year in my entire undergrad. It gave me room for new projects, connections, and classes I would not have done if I tried to rush it. So take your time and enjoy!"
3099,2020-06-07 23:33:17,gxm38h,We can double up and save costs. I'm ded.
3100,2020-06-07 23:42:02,gxm38h,How can we come if we are all dead?
3101,2020-06-07 19:25:45,gxm38h,Right?? And damn do they look good. I'm getting UN vibes again. Dark haired bangtan in suits never disappoints.
3102,2020-06-07 19:20:08,gxm38h,I miss them so much.
3103,2020-06-07 20:31:44,gxm38h,YES.
3104,2020-06-07 20:32:53,gxm38h,Omg it's up daebaakkk
3105,2020-06-07 20:33:24,gxm38h,Yes. Rewatching later.
3106,2020-06-07 23:14:58,gxm38h,Needed lol
3107,2020-06-08 00:33:55,gxm38h,Someone is cutting onions :((
3108,2020-06-07 19:23:57,gxm38h,"i was literally at a protest yesterday, everyone kneeling and wearing masks."
3109,2020-06-07 19:25:11,gxm38h,OMG PLEASE!!!!😯😯😯American Armys please make it happen!
3110,2020-06-07 20:10:42,gxm38h,I laughed and cried a little at that 😭
3111,2020-06-07 22:59:56,gxm38h,Jesus I totally feel you there.
3112,2020-06-07 23:16:10,gxm38h,same 🤭
3113,2020-06-07 23:16:52,gxm38h,Hmm 💅🏻
3114,2020-06-07 23:17:11,gxm38h,lol underrated comment
3115,2020-06-07 23:19:03,gxm38h,Me too!
3116,2020-06-07 23:19:00,gxm38h,How so? :P
3117,2020-06-07 17:17:29,gxm38h,"Thanks, that means I have plenty of time to do the dishes in between :P Or play some terraria. Wherever my priorities decide to lie lol"
3118,2020-06-07 19:20:33,gxm38h,I want him back and I'm not even american. Can us English folk share him too? XD
3119,2020-06-07 19:28:51,gxm38h,I definitely only put it on for BTS but I’m glad I’m watching all of this.
3120,2020-06-07 19:46:00,gxm38h,Right?? Replace YouTube rewind with this!
3121,2020-06-07 20:37:07,gxm38h,Was it 12 mins long?
3122,2020-06-07 20:56:15,gxm38h,"And it's exciting to think it's the same for locals seeing bts for the first time, too!"
3123,2020-06-07 23:37:17,gxm38h,ikr. just realized i missed them so muchh
3124,2020-06-07 23:41:05,gxm38h,"The song choices were perfect.  The order they performed them were perfect too, ending with something light and happy."
3125,2020-06-07 23:54:15,gxm38h,This was me too!!! I screamed when I realized what they were singing. I couldn't be happier with their song choice
3126,2020-06-08 00:02:41,gxm38h,You get spring day cuz its your cake day!!!
3127,2020-06-08 00:07:36,gxm38h,The answer is obv YES!
3128,2020-06-08 00:08:42,gxm38h,I just noticed they switched mics at the end!! Jimin has the green and V has the gold
3129,2020-06-08 00:42:24,gxm38h,But did she ever leave? 😂
3130,2020-06-07 19:55:38,gxm38h,It means so much more than a singular moment right now. It’s truly a message for all of us.
3131,2020-06-07 20:34:16,gxm38h,"Army’s are so talented.

Edit: oh it’s BTS lol ahahhha"
3132,2020-06-07 20:48:19,gxm38h,I've been SUPER impressed by all of the speeches. This has been well done.
3133,2020-06-07 23:34:42,gxm38h,Yup
3134,2020-06-07 23:43:05,gxm38h,"""Jungkook in jeans""

I agree."
3135,2020-06-07 23:43:43,gxm38h,95z vibing away. Happy 95z = happy everyone
3136,2020-06-08 01:24:38,gxm38h,[you mean like this](https://twitter.com/glossbuns/status/1269777458309459968?s=20)
3137,2020-06-07 23:45:34,gxm38h,YES!! 12.30 AM TO 5AM for me but TOTALLY TOTALLY ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT
3138,2020-06-08 00:06:05,gxm38h,I just want to make him my bff!
3139,2020-06-07 23:50:41,gxm38h,He always sings Spring Day in a slightly different vocal tone/colour. Like its really soft and smooth. I really love it. Would love to have him sing like that in another song too. Kind of does in Mikrokosmos but not for very long.
3140,2020-06-07 23:49:38,gxm38h,Jin really stood out to me in these performances!! Also I really want the sweatshirt he wore for Mikrokosmos lol
3141,2020-06-07 19:10:17,gxm38h,So good lol!
3142,2020-06-07 19:20:02,gxm38h,Same!! She is so gorgeous no matter what but this look even more!
3143,2020-06-07 20:05:26,gxm38h,It's a reminder to keep a tissue box nearby!
3144,2020-06-07 20:05:45,gxm38h,I wonder since they have so much time if they'll all have some time to speak 👀
3145,2020-06-07 20:51:49,gxm38h,Yes! I love how each individual speech are personal and reflective of their personalities.
3146,2020-06-07 21:01:02,gxm38h,AHHHH SO TRUE
3147,2020-06-07 23:12:08,gxm38h,Imagining their mouths open hehe
3148,2020-06-07 23:14:09,gxm38h,Who is most likely to twerk along with the song?
3149,2020-06-07 23:30:32,gxm38h,So SMILEY 😭😭😭
3150,2020-06-08 00:00:56,gxm38h,It seems they went more emotional than athem like . Also ON is quite demanding  vocals and dancing alike.  I think just seeing them sitting down and slaying those vocals and having fun is much more personal  and comforting than a powerful we will survive song.
3151,2020-06-07 23:36:36,gxm38h,"me too! it would be perfect for the graduation theme, no?

but spring day was a perfect choice as well."
3152,2020-06-07 23:36:38,gxm38h,I need fan cams/edits of Joon during Mikrokosmos ASAP ty
3153,2020-06-07 23:34:25,gxm38h,Brave of you to assume he ONLY carries it for BWL.
3154,2020-06-07 23:35:59,gxm38h,I love how most of them dance like old men when they're not choreographed. It makes my heart so happy.
3155,2020-06-07 23:41:35,gxm38h,I noticed that too! I hope we'll get to see more next weekend!
3156,2020-06-08 00:23:10,gxm38h,A proud and old 2012 here.
3157,2020-06-08 00:46:25,gxm38h,Yup lol 2011 and then 2015
3158,2020-06-08 03:52:57,gxm38h,From high school class of 2010 here! Shoutout to my fellow 2010 grads!
3159,2020-06-07 19:40:03,gxm38h,What’s your story.
3160,2020-06-07 19:42:31,gxm38h,"It'll be shocking in unexpected ways, but you'll be alright 🥰 And it'll give you loads of confidence once you've settled down. All the best 🤗"
3161,2020-06-07 19:44:18,gxm38h,Me too. So many good songs and comforting lyrics 🥺
3162,2020-06-07 20:17:33,gxm38h,Truth bombbbb
3163,2020-06-07 20:45:44,gxm38h,[deleted]
3164,2020-06-07 20:43:39,gxm38h,"Lol! A mood, though"
3165,2020-06-07 21:14:08,gxm38h,He did? Omg aww
3166,2020-06-07 20:48:54,gxm38h,ok but same lmao
3167,2020-06-07 20:49:50,gxm38h,We are on the same page haha!! Even though I'm not a graduate (I'll graduate in 2021).
3168,2020-06-07 21:01:46,gxm38h,"What did he say, please? I missed it"
3169,2020-06-07 21:01:50,gxm38h,younger? STILL
3170,2020-06-07 21:02:24,gxm38h,10 Things I Hate About You was my first introduction to the epic crush that was JGL.
3171,2020-06-07 21:01:01,gxm38h,Yas. Please me too.
3172,2020-06-07 21:02:50,gxm38h,"Same, and I still do if I'm being honest."
3173,2020-06-07 23:08:40,gxm38h,"find peace for now and keep fighting! as Seokjin said, I hope you can turn something into an opportunity for you!"
3174,2020-06-07 23:17:46,gxm38h,"I'm sorry to hear about you losing your job. Since you're a technical writer, I think some companies are still hiring remote technical writers."
3175,2020-06-07 23:06:50,gxm38h,SAME
3176,2020-06-07 23:08:45,gxm38h,Yes 🥺
3177,2020-06-07 23:09:30,gxm38h,Lol that was *the* song back in the day.
3178,2020-06-07 23:14:54,gxm38h,I hope so!
3179,2020-06-07 23:15:30,gxm38h,I am really hoping for this 😭
3180,2020-06-07 23:26:46,gxm38h,I was just thinking the same thing!
3181,2020-06-07 23:45:11,gxm38h,Hands up who'd join him ^^^me
3182,2020-06-07 23:34:31,gxm38h,Literally same I did not see 2/3 coming
3183,2020-06-07 21:24:33,gxm38h,it's been reinstated! Thanks!
3184,2020-06-07 21:09:10,gxm38h,"Me too. I've been watching everyone's speeches (not just BTS's) and were I a graduate of 2020, I'd be feeling a bit of pressure to go change the world. I like how Jin's message was that it's ok to take a breathe and to go at your own pace. I felt like all of BTS's messages provided comfort in some way."
3185,2020-06-07 21:04:26,gxm38h,Mine too. His and Yoongi's 100% spoke to my soul. They were so relatable.
3186,2020-06-07 23:34:28,gxm38h,"He is, he's adorable and was obviously in a great mood when they filmed this!"
3187,2020-06-07 23:32:52,gxm38h,He’s amazing!
3188,2020-06-07 23:34:08,gxm38h,He truly did omg
3189,2020-06-07 23:37:53,gxm38h,he looks gorgeous as well.
3190,2020-06-08 00:01:59,gxm38h,He totally is!! He did for me.
3191,2020-06-07 19:09:13,gxm38h,Very warm and heartfelt feelings.
3192,2020-06-07 19:15:44,gxm38h,Same lol
3193,2020-06-07 19:17:38,gxm38h,ngl that’s what my mind went to when the marching band came in lol
3194,2020-06-07 19:32:30,gxm38h,Me tooo! M not sure I'll survive BTS's wisdom
3195,2020-06-07 19:38:54,gxm38h,"I recommend countdown, green light, I care, 1+1, and halo my personal favorites."
3196,2020-06-07 19:44:35,gxm38h,Voice is great.
3197,2020-06-07 20:22:00,gxm38h,YES YES YES YES YES YES YES 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
3198,2020-06-07 20:42:47,gxm38h,Team Food Break 🥘
3199,2020-06-07 21:41:27,gxm38h,"It’s not stated explicitly but I think it’s very much directed at US graduates, which is a missed opportunity tbh given YT is such a global platform"
3200,2020-06-07 21:38:21,gxm38h,"I think this was organized in the United States for US graduates, but is for everyone!"
3201,2020-06-07 22:22:39,gxm38h,You might have about 45-60 mins to power nap! We’re about halfway done with part 4. And BTS is the last segment to part 5.
3202,2020-06-07 22:23:59,gxm38h,you can do it! hang in there!
3203,2020-06-07 23:37:13,gxm38h,Or 2.30 am. I second that!
3204,2020-06-07 23:53:57,gxm38h,"Me too 1.30 am, but I can't sleep now. Rip me at my uni classes today at 8 am ."
3205,2020-06-07 20:01:24,gxm38h,Already in shambles and I KNOW IM GOING TO BE shaking when Joon speaks oooooomgggg
3206,2020-06-07 23:36:29,gxm38h,woah hahah time to rewatch!
3207,2020-06-07 23:36:59,gxm38h,OMG so fast!! Thanks!
3208,2020-06-07 23:52:30,gxm38h,Rolled up sleeves and tattoos..........goodbye world...
3209,2020-06-07 23:47:24,gxm38h,"Wait, what?"
3210,2020-06-08 00:03:21,gxm38h,And when he wears a short-sleeved shirt when it gets too hot on Tour... goodbye world
3211,2020-06-08 04:26:42,gxm38h,Yep...Yoongi ultimate tsundere. I love it
3212,2020-06-07 19:00:16,gxm38h,"Yup, I stan a good leader :P"
3213,2020-06-07 19:22:33,gxm38h,It’s the complete and kind sentences of hope and strong leadership. Feels good.
3214,2020-06-07 19:23:45,gxm38h,Sometimes I forget how much I miss them and then I hear them speak 😭😭
3215,2020-06-07 19:08:24,gxm38h,"Yes — she’s comforting, inspiring, and strong & gentle at the same time. I really like the way she speaks"
3216,2020-06-07 19:26:44,gxm38h,"Agree. I wasn’t really sure what to expect, but this is really amazing."
3217,2020-06-07 20:35:47,gxm38h,Is there anywhere J-Hope's hot body? Are you curious? :))))
3218,2020-06-07 20:39:43,gxm38h,He is an SNL cast member :)
3219,2020-06-07 20:39:50,gxm38h,Co-host of weekend update on SNL!
3220,2020-06-07 20:58:14,gxm38h,I have the same thoughts when I see them on mainstream programs as well.
3221,2020-06-07 21:16:14,gxm38h,"Na I 'm wondering about it too.
I thought they did amazing. 
I'll bet some locals will be taken aback by their looks, especially JK and Tae."
3222,2020-06-07 21:28:56,gxm38h,Yes! I love that all seven of them are individuals who complement each other and speak to different people at different points in their lives.
3223,2020-06-07 21:42:05,gxm38h,She genuinely seems like a really great person.
3224,2020-06-07 21:45:17,gxm38h,i told my crush i liked him and idk what happened bc my brain has completely blocked it off so it must've been bad
3225,2020-06-07 21:51:45,gxm38h,"I told the guy I had a HUGE crush on in junior high that I used to like him on our last day of high school. He just said “Yeah, I knew.” GREAT. Glad to know you didn’t give a shit. 🙄"
3226,2020-06-07 22:04:56,gxm38h,"This is cute.   It's better that you told him though, as boys in high school can be oblivious.  My husband was a prom date for one of my friends in high school.  Talking about it now, he says it didn't even occur to him that she might be interested in him, even though she asked him to go to prom with her, because she didn't explicitly say she was interested."
3227,2020-06-07 21:44:00,gxm38h,So bc you said it’s embarrassing that it didn’t go well?
3228,2020-06-07 21:56:29,gxm38h,"I wrote mine a love letter (this was a long time ago I don't know if people still write love letters lmao) and gave to him on the last day of our school year, and I never found out what his reaction was because I left for Canada 2 months later and never saw him again"
3229,2020-06-07 23:02:19,gxm38h,I didnt even know she's pregnant .-.
3230,2020-06-07 23:02:24,gxm38h,Same I was confused for a moment lol
3231,2020-06-07 23:09:26,gxm38h,BWL and ON please please please!
3232,2020-06-07 23:08:09,gxm38h,If they're the closer maybe even 4??
3233,2020-06-07 23:40:08,gxm38h,BOGO SHIPDAAAAAAAA 😭😭😭😭😭
3234,2020-06-07 19:39:09,gxm38h,Same. I'd have never known this otherwise so happy right now
3235,2020-06-07 20:26:38,gxm38h,SAME
3236,2020-06-07 23:51:40,gxm38h,The locations were so nice. Do you know where they were set?
3237,2020-06-07 19:56:02,gxm38h,Because it is!! 👍🏼
3238,2020-06-07 19:58:24,gxm38h,It's always been relevant sweetie💜💜💜
3239,2020-06-07 16:11:08,gxm38h,A speech is much longer.
3240,2020-06-07 19:16:51,gxm38h,Does this mean a full ON performance with marching band and dancers it not out of the question? 👀
3241,2020-06-07 19:36:59,gxm38h,"Education isn't limited to formal institutions. Knowledge can come in many forms, as long as you never stop learning."
3242,2020-06-07 19:32:36,gxm38h,Don't feel bad about it! I think they are saying it especially now for these Grads who's did it. But that doesn't mean those who don't go aren't successful or powerful.
3243,2020-06-07 19:32:33,gxm38h,"Don’t forget it’s never to late if you want to. 20,30,40,50,60 and beyond. You’re still important if you don’t."
3244,2020-06-07 19:48:51,gxm38h,Beyoncé just said she didn’t go to college and look at her - it’s ok! Education is more than a degree.
3245,2020-06-07 19:35:36,gxm38h,"If you’re from the US, just to let you know that gap years (years in between highschool and college that you take for a break or to work) is actually very popular abroad. And if you don’t ever want to go to college, then that is also okay! It isn’t for everyone and we all have our own paths to take! 

Stay strong and good luck!"
3246,2020-06-07 19:43:24,gxm38h,"It's okay, Yoongi's got you"
3247,2020-06-07 19:48:04,gxm38h,College isn’t always the answer. 💜
3248,2020-06-07 19:47:18,gxm38h,We all did.
3249,2020-06-07 19:50:30,gxm38h,I smiled at this and felt this to my soul. But we do gotta save ourselves too ✊
3250,2020-06-07 19:54:42,gxm38h,"Right? I've teared up THRICE Already and I'm not graduating? And it's not even BTS! 

DIDN'T KNOW this is what we needed"
3251,2020-06-07 19:54:23,gxm38h,Don’t forget to drink water!
3252,2020-06-07 20:10:26,gxm38h,Right? Haha
3253,2020-06-07 20:11:31,gxm38h,Agreed!
3254,2020-06-07 20:18:43,gxm38h,"Philosophy may not pay the bills, but it’s helped me stay sane more than anything else in my life. Always more to learn, more to think about, etc. definitely underrated."
3255,2020-06-07 20:16:48,gxm38h,Looooool me too 😂😂😂
3256,2020-06-07 20:36:57,gxm38h,I actually just bleached my hair moments before.... I felt that
3257,2020-06-07 21:09:27,gxm38h,It’s on Amazon Prime! I watch it every day! One of the best sitcoms ever!
3258,2020-06-07 21:05:28,gxm38h,"Third rock from the sun! Don’t worry many know ;D

That show was hilarious from memory"
3259,2020-06-07 21:55:53,gxm38h,I love Chris Pine but Chris Evans is #1 for me.
3260,2020-06-07 22:51:37,gxm38h,🔥🔥🔥
3261,2020-06-07 23:40:21,gxm38h,Both the speech and performance was up the moment they ended! Bangtantv noona really had her finger on the go public button! Lol
3262,2020-06-08 00:22:08,gxm38h,"I think it may have been cuts from different performances. We don't actually see the switch, but it was funny nonetheless.

That plus Joon and Jin dancing in the background was hilarious"
3263,2020-06-08 00:54:52,gxm38h,Totally agree! I'm so happy I fell into the BTS rabbithole 5 weeks ago. They are such special human beings.
3264,2020-06-08 00:26:33,gxm38h,"Spanish subs says ""Museo nacional de Corea"" and that's it."
3265,2020-06-08 04:07:19,gxm38h,"Not sure if it's possible but I'm hoping they'll update the subs later. Like what is the point of subbing if all it's gonna mention is ""\[singing in Korean\]""...? lol"
3266,2020-06-07 19:57:47,gxm38h,What I wouldn’t give for BTS to perform UGH! Tonight.
3267,2020-06-07 23:38:45,gxm38h,congratulations to you!!!
3268,2020-06-07 19:11:30,gxm38h,Exactly! I'm here for it!
3269,2020-06-07 19:16:40,gxm38h,Imagine if tae starts posting on weverse like during bangbangcon
3270,2020-06-07 19:16:57,gxm38h,"4am KST, probably not :("
3271,2020-06-07 19:44:45,gxm38h,I think it said that Finneas (aka Billie Eilish’s brother) was the producer?
3272,2020-06-07 19:44:17,gxm38h,Was just thinking this lol. This editor and mixer needs a raise. Methinks it's Finneas.
3273,2020-06-07 19:47:36,gxm38h,"who was the one girl? not Noah Cyrus, but the other one was the only one I couldn’t recognize"
3274,2020-06-07 19:50:27,gxm38h,Video and sound editors the uncredited mvps of this pandemic.
3275,2020-06-07 19:44:33,gxm38h,Yes! Chris Martin
3276,2020-06-07 19:44:29,gxm38h,It’s him
3277,2020-06-07 20:26:51,gxm38h,"I’m thinking they had to all dye it brown or black because it’s such a formal event so they wanted to chill on the hair colors, maybe!"
3278,2020-06-07 20:29:58,gxm38h,"dont worry, we're gonna go with ""the third from the left"" or something like that XD"
3279,2020-06-07 20:33:15,gxm38h,"They all introduced themselves though, so you can't ask for more than that! 😂"
3280,2020-06-07 21:36:27,gxm38h,:) here's one ***hug*** for you
3281,2020-06-07 21:14:35,gxm38h,"While we're dreaming, what's a girl have to do to get a performance of Home?"
3282,2020-06-07 21:15:33,gxm38h,I hope they're saving her for next weekend's concert lol
3283,2020-06-07 21:44:35,gxm38h,My husband just made me a banana daiquiri. We've got good taste in men. c:
3284,2020-06-07 22:04:53,gxm38h,"Apply with a light hand and use a swishing move back and forth. You can always apply more, but it's harder to adjust when you apply heavily right away. Start with a beige colour for your base before putting on darker/more vibrant colours. I usually just use dark eyeshadow for the corners of my eyes unless it's a heavy smokey look I'm going for. 

Eye shadow primer is a must so your eyeshadow doesn't run, crease or melt hours later."
3285,2020-06-07 22:05:22,gxm38h,"SAME 😭. I have really small eyelids.

These people are blending like 6 different shades on there, and I’m like “Sis WHERE” — my liner takes up half my eyelid, and I don’t even do it that thick"
3286,2020-06-07 22:46:13,gxm38h,Can’t do eyeliner. It’s super difficult and my hands are always shaking and my eyelids keep fluttering all involuntary 😂
3287,2020-06-07 21:59:24,gxm38h,SAME HERE!
3288,2020-06-07 21:59:26,gxm38h,This is me.
3289,2020-06-07 22:52:34,gxm38h,Do a high IQ move and decorate your glasses instead :P
3290,2020-06-07 22:08:09,gxm38h,"same, also according to him I am very intelligent"
3291,2020-06-07 22:17:39,gxm38h,Jinx. Lol.
3292,2020-06-07 23:01:30,gxm38h,hey what's good
3293,2020-06-07 23:04:10,gxm38h,Congrats!!!
3294,2020-06-07 23:05:53,gxm38h,Congratulations!!
3295,2020-06-07 23:19:38,gxm38h,What songs do you recommend then? :P
3296,2020-06-07 23:20:08,gxm38h,GO DELULU OR GO HOME!!!! 🤡🤡🤡 IT'S THE ONLY ARMY WAY!
3297,2020-06-07 23:23:42,gxm38h,SAME. 😂
3298,2020-06-07 23:34:44,gxm38h,RIGHT!
3299,2020-06-07 23:27:59,gxm38h,[deleted]
3300,2020-06-07 23:40:41,gxm38h,probably trying to recreate so what in the more graceful settings. cutie!
3301,2020-06-07 23:51:12,gxm38h,I wish they had done that too. I don't understand why they didn't.
3302,2020-06-07 23:35:32,gxm38h,Yes me too! Mikrokosmos always makes me feel emotional for that reason. I’ve got a video on my phone of the ‘nananana’ and the big army sign rising up as fireworks go off at Wembley 🥺
3303,2020-06-07 23:34:30,gxm38h,Same here! :(
3304,2020-06-07 23:34:51,gxm38h,"Same. I said out loud in my apt, ""spring day!?!"" 😁"
3305,2020-06-07 23:37:36,gxm38h,I saw it and went 'OH NO' and started sobbing. My mom kept saying 'let me take your picture. Let me!' 🤣
3306,2020-06-08 00:20:25,gxm38h,"Ikr! He was dancing in the background the entire time!

Edit: Jin too! He looked like he was doing an old man walk, while RM was trying out dance spins XD"
3307,2020-06-07 19:42:53,gxm38h,💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
3308,2020-06-07 20:08:55,gxm38h,I LOVE watching their YouTuber room renovations!! 🥰
3309,2020-06-07 20:07:49,gxm38h,Yes
3310,2020-06-07 20:18:44,gxm38h,SAME AAHHHHHHHHHH
3311,2020-06-07 20:33:49,gxm38h,They did already! Its on their BangtanTV youtube channel!
3312,2020-06-07 20:35:55,gxm38h,We will be updating this thread with links as we get them. The BTS commencement speech has already been added above!
3313,2020-06-07 22:01:50,gxm38h,They radiate happy couple energy in the most positive ways.
3314,2020-06-07 22:32:15,gxm38h,"I think it would be absurd to call them ""headliners"" and only give them one song. Two minimum please, yt. 🥺"
3315,2020-06-07 22:30:46,gxm38h,It looks like they're the last to perform so I'm hopeful that it'll be more than one song.
3316,2020-06-07 22:48:17,gxm38h,Same. Therefore I claim this one.
3317,2020-06-07 22:52:51,gxm38h,Yeah.  I skipped out my graduation ceremony to early start my vacation travels.  I was so disillusioned by my profession that I had spent years and  so much money on to get a degree.     But the actual work in that same profession turned out great - so it taught me not to write off a profession without actually experiencing it.
3318,2020-06-07 23:15:35,gxm38h,Lololol only thing I recognised too
3319,2020-06-07 23:17:16,gxm38h,"I said that too, I'm old"
3320,2020-06-07 23:16:52,gxm38h,Texan ARMY unite!
3321,2020-06-07 23:19:33,gxm38h,YEEHAW BABYYYY
3322,2020-06-07 18:23:43,gxm38h,I'm sure it will be available on Youtube for free since it is a Youtube event
3323,2020-06-07 18:59:02,gxm38h,"Same, but I've never been to uni lol"
3324,2020-06-07 20:17:13,gxm38h,2 yrd program instead of the conventional 4 yrs
3325,2020-06-07 20:17:18,gxm38h,Bachelor’s is a 4 year degree. Associate is a 2 year degree. Like junior college or community college (shout out to the sitcom “Community”!) 🤪
3326,2020-06-07 20:17:24,gxm38h,An Associate's Degree is a 2-year degree that is usually for education certificates and the likes; a BA/BS is only found at a 4-year university/college.
3327,2020-06-07 20:17:26,gxm38h,"A bachelor's degree is from a college/university, yes! An associate's degree is 2 years, while bachelor's degree is typically 4 years. I believe the order is associates, bachelors, masters, then doctorate degree."
3328,2020-06-07 20:18:30,gxm38h,you are exactly right you can get a bachelors from a college or university! An associates degree is a degree obtained from something we call community college which is a two-year institution. I hope that made sense!
3329,2020-06-07 20:18:32,gxm38h,Typically in US college are smaller than a university but not by rule and both offer 4-year degrees (like bachelors) or graduate degrees like masters or doctorates.
3330,2020-06-07 20:18:43,gxm38h,You graduate with a bachelors from both college and university. They are basically equal with colleges typically being smaller in size than universities. An associates degrees is the halfway point between a high school degree and a bachelors. Typically you can get them after two years of college.
3331,2020-06-07 20:19:13,gxm38h,"College is the same as university in the US although universities tend to be larger. You get a bachelor’s degree from college/university after about 4 years (could be more or less depending on field of study and whether you’re a full time student). 

An associates degree is a degree that takes 2 years to earn (basically the first two years of a bachelors degree)"
3332,2020-06-07 20:31:55,gxm38h,He was trying to say obscure 😄
3333,2020-06-07 20:31:57,gxm38h,Obscure
3334,2020-06-07 20:43:21,gxm38h,"same, and i'm 22."
3335,2020-06-07 20:40:10,gxm38h,The schedule seems very set so far
3336,2020-06-07 20:45:10,gxm38h,I definitely had to watch a second time on YouTube because I am easily distracted by their faces; Jimin's eyes were pretty entrancing and I kind of forgot he was speaking a language I don't know.
3337,2020-06-07 21:00:26,gxm38h,Hi! Are the speeches of the other speakers going to be uploaded too? I would also like to watch them but it's 5 AM in our timezone and I want to go back to sleep cause I work later
3338,2020-06-07 20:52:11,gxm38h,"LOL well he was at Stanford and it is in Northern California so pretty far from the famous beaches he was probably talking about!  I remember as a freshman at Stanford going to the beach, it was over the foothills and very remote, a very different beach experience than you think of in Southern Cal!"
3339,2020-06-07 20:53:21,gxm38h,I too am for online graduations forever. And hated my in person graduation.
3340,2020-06-07 20:53:31,gxm38h,it's also interesting how i now understand the value of a physical graduation in the span of just two hours compared to three years of undergrad studies 😭
3341,2020-06-07 20:59:01,gxm38h,...MARIAH?????????
3342,2020-06-07 20:59:15,gxm38h,😮
3343,2020-06-07 21:06:17,gxm38h,Then the world will collectively cry together. Especially if they decide to include translation subtitles.
3344,2020-06-07 21:34:33,gxm38h,Hmmm — wearing grey so I’m ‘bout to not match with mine 🍷
3345,2020-06-07 23:12:43,gxm38h,"I was thinking BWL/Dionysus, but apparently it's gonna be more than 2."
3346,2020-06-07 23:34:11,gxm38h,Jimin sounds AMAZING; I wonder if he's had vocal lessons during the downtime they've had. His voice didn't scoop or pitch like it usually does when he starts his lines; he came in pure and clean. He did an amazing job.
3347,2020-06-07 23:42:56,gxm38h,I almost instantly hit post-concert-depression. I want more!
3348,2020-06-07 19:21:35,gxm38h,Or to people who literally hate graduation ceremonies like me. But it’s still really nice to hear for others. So far 10/10 support virtual graduation ceremonies more . Then everyone feels supported .
3349,2020-06-07 19:24:17,gxm38h,":(

I hope those people have the support of friends/siblings and their teachers/professors. Everyone deserves support for their accomplishments"
3350,2020-06-08 01:12:13,gxm38h,"Came here to see if anyone was discussing this. One possibility that came in my head was that they did live vocals and then somehow it didn't turn out well? I feel like usually when everyone else is dubbed, the rap line NEVER is, so it was very strange to hear it."
3351,2020-06-08 01:52:29,gxm38h,"I could be wrong, but I thought BWL sounded live (I could especially hear Jin's breathing/huffing in time with his jumps/kicks). 

Regardless, they sounded amazing! Especially Spring Day, my goodness."
3352,2020-06-08 02:18:51,gxm38h,"I am not sure whether it was live or not. But if it was dubbed, it was because of the place. BTS had the performance outside of the museum. And it could have a bad effect on the sound. So they could not use the live version of the performance. Anyway the performance was so good that i watch it repeatedly. It is so addicted. I love their happy face and good singing and rapping."
3353,2020-06-08 07:34:08,gxm38h,"It was clearly filmed in a couple of takes. Jks shirt sleeve is down one second and buttoned up the next. Also jimin and V's microphones magically swapping several times. I'm guessing they used the live vocals but a mash up of visual takes, which then makes the audio slightly out with the visual?? Amazing performance though,  loved every second of it"
3354,2020-06-08 07:37:09,gxm38h,"Everything sounded like they sang live to me, but it looks like they had multiple takes. It seems they spliced together the best part from each take. It's super noticable in Mikrokosmos where people in the background looks like they are teleporting whenever they change cuts. That's why some parts of the video doesn't match with the audio but at some parts they do. 

The audio also undergone some editing/post processing, so it sounds smoother than true live version, but not as clean as a true studio version. They also never perform without MR unless it's an unplugged version. So at some parts when the mic is too low, you only hear the MR. Which is a problem I have even during a proper concert performance. Sometimes when watching fancams I can't hear their voices when they sing in a lower volume, but if I replay the performance on a livestream/DVD version, where MR is mixed lower, I can hear their voices better."

3356,2020-06-07 19:29:25,gxm38h,I believe about an hour each (approximate)
3357,2020-06-07 19:29:31,gxm38h,About an hour.
3358,2020-06-07 19:29:34,gxm38h,Roughly an hour each
3359,2020-06-07 19:29:46,gxm38h,About 1 hour each if I'm not mistaken

3363,2020-06-07 20:06:42,gxm38h,No BTS yet.
3364,2020-06-07 20:08:07,gxm38h,Yes! I am excited; there are green cherries on the trees :)

3366,2020-06-07 21:00:16,gxm38h,Lol. David's face was my face when she came on.
3367,2020-06-07 21:18:42,gxm38h,Except the part where she was part of an administration that actively made those issues worse

3372,2020-06-07 23:18:43,gxm38h,Lol I was wondering the same thing !
3373,2020-06-07 23:25:12,gxm38h,"right!! as much as the current situation sucks, at least their voices are so well rested and clear 💜💜"

And I loved loved BTS' speech."
3392,2020-06-07 21:34:47,gxm38h,I think everyone is popping in for the people they want to see. There’s people I’m looking forward to in every block so I’ll be here the whole time lol
3393,2020-06-07 23:20:39,gxm38h,"If you ever work in corporate, public service or politics, you will understand"
3394,2020-06-07 19:13:45,gxm38h,Big mood lol
3395,2020-06-07 20:51:41,gxm38h,It’s fine. Everyone needs breaks .
3396,2020-06-07 20:59:10,gxm38h,Yes! Such a good and funny movie 🐩
3397,2020-06-07 21:31:56,gxm38h,How come?
3398,2020-06-07 21:33:38,gxm38h,Oh no. Why.
3399,2020-06-07 22:07:12,gxm38h,another women’s college alum?! i’m not Barnard but am a fellow seven sisters alum!
3400,2020-06-07 21:57:44,gxm38h,but lashes complete the look 😔
3401,2020-06-07 22:19:59,gxm38h,No... It's a guess at this point. No schedule has been given.
3402,2020-06-07 22:21:26,gxm38h,"According to the schedule, some time after 7pm"
3403,2020-06-07 22:21:54,gxm38h,"The description in the video says approximate timing is 7pm EST/4pm PST.

I just started watching the stream now so not sure if its actually following that schedule!"
3404,2020-06-07 23:05:38,gxm38h,You're making me feel old here XD
3405,2020-06-07 23:12:39,gxm38h,Cash Shit
3406,2020-06-07 23:20:29,gxm38h,Please I want Fire in there somewhere! Or Anpanman! But that’s my delulu brain. 😂
3407,2020-06-07 23:23:28,gxm38h,ON is almost guarenteed lol. I  think medley is fair considering they're the last act they'll be going out with a bang.....they might perform BWL but they've done so so many times in the US now so doubt 🤔.
3408,2020-06-07 23:31:50,gxm38h,Rhe most beautiful song the most beautiful dance. I may like this version specifically more than the digital one
3409,2020-06-07 23:41:18,gxm38h,"I noticed that too :P Made me wonder how many times they redid the song, makes sense they'd try to make each other laugh to make it more enjoyable :P"
3410,2020-06-07 23:38:36,gxm38h,They've had them for a while now I'm sure
3411,2020-06-07 23:43:43,gxm38h,"I noticed that, at first I was wondering if they'd swapped them around for the sake of it."
3412,2020-06-07 22:19:24,gxm38h,Sometimes a full beat is fun. Makes you feel powerful. Natural makeup is good too though.
3413,2020-06-07 23:11:59,gxm38h,I just shake it back at them.
3414,2020-06-07 20:18:20,gxm38h,"My mom finds her annoying, but I think she has really positive energy. Very chill as well."
3415,2020-06-07 20:18:34,gxm38h,lol! I do too! I love her as a singer and she has an amazing voice but not a big fan of her TV persona :)
3416,2020-06-07 21:12:37,gxm38h,"Each of them spoke and it was very touching, I would recommend just watching the video when you're able. It's uploaded to BangtanTV."
3417,2020-06-07 21:14:12,gxm38h,In what way?
3418,2020-06-07 21:45:24,gxm38h,SAME OMG
3419,2020-06-07 23:19:02,gxm38h,Mightt wanna think again.They mocked BTS by racially making fun of asians and the sound of korean language.
3420,2020-06-07 23:17:37,gxm38h,You’re right on time! BTS is next!
3421,2020-06-07 23:18:10,gxm38h,Nope! BTS is next to perform after CNCO (around in 10/15 mins I'm guessing)
3422,2020-06-07 23:18:09,gxm38h,NOPE!! The boys are next!!
3423,2020-06-07 23:18:35,gxm38h,Not for the performance
3424,2020-06-07 23:26:44,gxm38h,This is not the first time you watched the MV with me a year ago lmao 😂
3425,2020-06-07 23:39:42,gxm38h,"I want Jin's shirt from Mikrokosmos, too! But I'm betting it's far out of my price point haha"
3426,2020-06-07 21:54:02,gxm38h,A breakfast burrito. I was salivating the entire goddamn time.
3427,2020-06-07 23:25:00,gxm38h,CNCO are NOT Army!They made fun of BTS by mocking their korean language.
3428,2020-06-07 23:25:01,gxm38h,OH MY GOD.
3429,2020-06-07 22:18:27,gxm38h,"I do, they were both sweet"
3430,2020-06-07 22:23:38,gxm38h,"I mean, clearly people cares, if nobody cared they wouldn't have literally millions of subscribers"
3431,2020-06-07 22:29:50,gxm38h,"Don’t be such a negative nancy, people who don’t care about pop music/kpop could easily say the same about BTS. Bringing down others for their interests is always a dick move."
3432,2020-06-07 22:23:01,gxm38h,"While I’m sure your intent was not meant to be mean, Nikkie also had an important 2020 as she came out as trans due to a blackmail threat. So, I personally am glad that she was featured."
3433,2020-06-07 21:24:36,gxm38h,She was the victim of an assassination attempt for speaking out about female education: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malala_Yousafzai
3434,2020-06-07 21:23:36,gxm38h,She was shot in the head
3435,2020-06-07 20:36:34,gxm38h,Totally! We often feel so pressured to be the fastest and forget that everyone has their own speed.
3436,2020-06-07 23:43:45,gxm38h,😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
3437,2020-06-07 17:48:09,gxm38h,Oh NO I am so sorry. Have fun in Seoul tho!
3438,2020-06-07 21:35:29,gxm38h,"Haha seriously, I can only imagine watching some of these not being familiar with these people and thinking wtf 😂😂"
3439,2020-06-07 21:42:42,gxm38h,Or full grown adults for whom graduation is a fairly distant memory
3440,2020-06-07 23:21:27,gxm38h,Same

didn't realize how much i missed them until that first note of spring day came in and i just got goosebumps"
3450,2020-06-08 03:51:25,gxm38h,"I was smiling like a fool during Tae's parts. :D He looked so happy and really in his element throughout. :) And when he does, he stands out even more.

That said, all the boys did amazing <3 Everyone was in the zone and were in sync. Plus the harmonies in Spring Day and how they actually enjoyed BWL this time around!"
3451,2020-06-07 20:14:28,gxm38h,"You tuned in at a good time, I think they are actually meant to speak soon now lol!"
3452,2020-06-07 20:58:58,gxm38h,"It gives an impression of humility and good manners, though it's not bad manners to not do it!"
3453,2020-06-08 00:01:05,gxm38h,That exactly that. I believe it has the power the bring world peace or something equally as powerful as give a person hope.
3454,2020-06-07 23:57:36,gxm38h,Right?!
3455,2020-06-08 00:04:54,gxm38h,We won’t talk about the sandals.
3456,2020-06-08 00:02:48,gxm38h,I bet twitter is going crazy rn
3457,2020-06-07 20:35:47,gxm38h,Is this the new Carpool Karaoke? I think we're gonna see an even bigger influx of baby armys and I can't waaaait!!
3458,2020-06-07 20:35:03,gxm38h,Good!!!
3459,2020-06-07 20:17:59,gxm38h,RIGHT?It would be HILARIOUS if it wasn't actually true...
3460,2020-06-07 17:31:44,gxm38h,.... or watch the youtube countdown slowly ticking by.  haha. hope you get your stuff done in time!

3463,2020-06-08 00:07:30,gxm38h,Omg I didn’t even realize it was my cake day haha

3468,2020-06-07 20:08:56,gxm38h,"I hope that they do and that the others will get some time to speak in Korean and with subs to best convey their feelings.

I will also be happy with a full speech from Namjoon a la UN speech (which I definitely cried to when I was watching live)."

3474,2020-06-07 20:35:27,gxm38h,Just finished college and decided I wasn't ready for grad school yet. So I'm working on my TEFL certification and applying to teach English in either Korea or China. It's gonna be an adventure and I'm thrilled but wow. The closer it gets the scarier it gets too...
3475,2020-06-07 20:37:09,gxm38h,Thank you so much! I know it'll be great and such an adventure! There's nothing like leaping into the unknown and hoping for the best.

3479,2020-06-08 11:24:11,gxm38h,Oh he just mentioned BTS amongst other famous people. Still!
3480,2020-06-07 21:03:59,gxm38h,Sameeee. I haven't seen him in so long.
3481,2020-06-07 23:19:01,gxm38h,"Yup! I've applied to about 15 remote roles so far so I'm hopeful that they'll be following up this week. I've even tried applying to a remote role out of Ireland but it wouldn't let me because I'm in the US, hah!"
3482,2020-06-07 23:15:42,gxm38h,Oh me too!!! 😭

3487,2020-06-07 20:48:04,gxm38h,OMG I thought I was the only one...😅
3488,2020-06-07 21:45:38,gxm38h,"Agreed. I graduated a while ago, but if this was my graduation year I'd definitely be disappointed. But maybe that's just me."

3491,2020-06-07 23:53:40,gxm38h,"Lol you can see his sleeve during the performance of Spring Day, specifically towards the end of the song. Granted, I exaggerated a little (you don’t see the whole thing) but you definitely get a good look at it. I only vaguely recall it through my blurry eyes while I was busy crying lmao"
3492,2020-06-07 23:55:39,gxm38h,For like a hot second then they used a closed-sleeve shot right after

3494,2020-06-07 21:43:03,gxm38h,From hearing her speak and advocating these past few years she really seems to be someone who’s dedicated to doing and being better. Very admirable for me.
3495,2020-06-07 21:53:01,gxm38h,I left him a note after we both finished our final test in one of our classes. He never called. I wonder if it's still in the book he had on his desk.
3496,2020-06-07 21:56:54,gxm38h,You sure he wasn't getting inspiration from star wars? lol

3533,2020-06-07 20:48:11,gxm38h,"Thank you all!

So, for example, i'm a physician. In my country you can only be a physician after studyng 7 years on a university, from wich 5 years are for the licentiate and then 2 years of practice for the professional dregree, so i have a licentiate on medicine and a professional title as a physician (technically ""physician surgeon"" but I don't think it's said like that in english). Then i can keep studying for 3 or 4 years to have a medical speciality or 3 years for a magister and then 5 for PhD.

Something similar on the US?"

3541,2020-06-08 01:32:19,gxm38h,"They probably decided on the set and the sound wasnt very good for live vocals there. I cant think of something else. Even tho I have seen BigHit weird dubbings before. 

I was watching the LY in New York DVD and when they were singing the mic drop remix RM sang his last line on his verse in Korean and I was like ""wait this line in the remix is an English one,did he confuse the versions or??"" So I found a fancam of the same show and RM rapped the remix english version and not the Korean one so BigHit dubbed the Korean line in the DVD for some reason."
3542,2020-06-08 03:36:43,gxm38h,BWL sounded like their usual combo of track and live vocals to me.
3543,2020-06-07 20:06:13,gxm38h,Thank you! I’ll check it out later.

3553,2020-06-07 23:21:13,gxm38h,That’s what we hope. But what we get is different. I’ll put out my wish for Don’t Leave Me lol
3554,2020-06-07 23:23:54,gxm38h,They’re literally doing that right now LOL
3555,2020-06-07 22:22:52,gxm38h,"Yes.  I think he got too used to my makeup-less face.  All I can think of is, how can I scare/tease him with this?  I kind of like torturing him a bit.  :P"
3556,2020-06-07 23:13:13,gxm38h,Its self-defense.
3557,2020-06-07 23:48:49,gxm38h,Shake shake shake!
3558,2020-06-07 20:50:30,gxm38h,"Yeah, she's positive, so I don't want to find her annoying :/"

3563,2020-06-07 23:18:19,gxm38h,Thanks you’re an angel!

3568,2020-06-07 22:19:22,gxm38h,I agree. Some people are really into the make up tutorial side of YouTube so I imagine that it was nice to see these people for them.

3580,2020-06-07 23:13:58,gxm38h,HAHAHA YES or Jackson Wang’s reaction

3585,2020-06-08 14:12:42,gxm38h,Thanks :)

3593,2020-06-08 00:22:24,gxm38h,Mte. The song choices were A+. It would have been beneficial if they had added subtitles for non-fans.
3594,2020-06-07 23:03:36,gxm38h,Congratulations!
3595,2020-06-07 20:35:37,gxm38h,I had the same heart-jump until I realized he actually said obscure. 😆
3596,2020-06-07 20:42:28,gxm38h,Mmm food. Im watching from my iPad lol. So food any times.
3597,2020-06-07 20:57:43,gxm38h,I just really don’t like crowds or in person attention. So in person graduation it’s like the opposite of my favorite thing lol
3598,2020-06-08 01:35:36,gxm38h,"It's also possible that they did all this in a short amount of time and their vocals weren't as strong by the end. Spring Day definitely sounded live so maybe they gave all their vocal energy to that and had none left.

I went on Twitter to see if anyone else was talking about it and EVERYONE thinks that all the vocals were live... it's not a crime to lip sync and even the best artists have to sometimes! Pointing it out is not hating on them."
3599,2020-06-07 20:10:02,gxm38h,"Fun fact. Her husband, Joey Zehr used to be in a boy band called The Click Five."

3604,2020-06-07 21:15:51,gxm38h,Should be. But the reality right now is that it’s not. It’s full of privilege.
3605,2020-06-07 21:16:52,gxm38h,I wasn't fully listening either but I think you heard right. Remember whose administration she was in.
3606,2020-06-07 21:18:10,gxm38h,Oh. Okay .
3607,2020-06-07 23:34:14,gxm38h,Why are you like this hmm
3608,2020-06-07 22:20:53,gxm38h,"Agreed! I could imagine people who aren’t into kpop saw BTS and may have had similar thoughts, but that would be invalidating all of us and our interest and care for the boys. So we shouldn’t invalidate other communities either!"
3609,2020-06-07 22:26:52,gxm38h,I don't do makeup at all because i'm too lazy but I love watching makeup tutorials :D
3610,2020-06-08 01:09:25,gxm38h,I have that shirt! I couldn't not get it when I found it it wasn't $1000
3611,2020-06-08 00:21:29,gxm38h,yeah that H&M one! but it really was a rare occurrence 🥺
3612,2020-06-08 11:20:22,gxm38h,lol as expected of bangtan 😅 I'll just look for something similar in my price range hahahaha
3613,2020-06-08 07:08:58,gxm38h,2007 here lol
3614,2020-06-07 20:38:40,gxm38h,Thank you so much! I won't be moving until January so hopefully things will be a little better but it really is a time full of unknowns...
3615,2020-06-07 22:28:50,gxm38h,That sucks. At least it means you didn't end up dating a jerk though :P
3616,2020-06-07 19:56:06,gxm38h,Tove lo?
3617,2020-06-08 07:16:58,gxm38h,"Hard agree especially with what you said on your second paragraph. I've watched too many BTS performances may it be on a concert, music show, tv shows etc. that I can often (not always!) discern if they are singing live or not. Imo they most likely sang live with backing track for BwL because of the choreo, but their team must have done something with the audio for the three songs to make it clear and loud in the video. Performing in a place like that will definitely affect how they sound.

Spring day was def live, it's easy to notice because of their facial expressions when they sang (I was also looking at their necks hehe)."
3618,2020-06-07 20:11:21,gxm38h,WHAAAAT OMG I REMEMBER THAT BAND. You just brought back a memory.
3619,2020-06-07 21:22:09,gxm38h,Tysm!
3620,2020-06-07 21:32:55,gxm38h,"Yes, agreed that it should be a right. I interpreted her statement to mean that she supports the idea of education as a privilege and not a right for all. Hence my comment about feeling unsure about that bit."
3621,2020-06-07 23:34:50,gxm38h,My biggest enemy is me pop a 9–1-1 🎶
3622,2020-06-07 22:23:50,gxm38h,Super agree!! There is something for everyone in this video!
3623,2020-06-08 01:14:07,gxm38h,Omgggg you NEED to wear it for one of those ARMY selca days!
3624,2020-06-08 14:03:26,gxm38h,"One of my favorite brands, [Wildfox](https://www.wildfox.com), has a lot of similar style jumpers. They’re expensive but they have really good sales! Their baggy beach jumpers are my favorite."
3625,2020-06-07 20:13:45,gxm38h,YES thank you!
3626,2020-06-07 20:13:44,gxm38h,Yeah! He was the drummer! He met Kate on their cheesy movie “Take Five”.
3627,2020-06-07 21:40:02,gxm38h,Oh okay. Yeah that would be ek.
3628,2020-06-08 01:15:47,gxm38h,"I don't show my face on ARMY internet but I totally would if I did! I was going to wear it to their concert I was supposed to go to in May but, well...ugh"
3629,2020-06-08 01:17:24,gxm38h,"Yeah totally understandable although you could always put a little sticker to hide your face! Don’t worry, don’t lose hope, you might get another chance to wear it! *fingers crossed*
Edit - lmao I just realised the purpose of ASRD is to show the face 😂😂"
3630,2020-06-06 05:18:09,gxksj8,I would say Jordan Fisher is too old too. At least for the movie.
3631,2020-06-06 05:42:40,gxksj8,I seem to remember on the audition for DEH for the role of Evan you have to be anywhere between 17-25. Jordan is too old to play it live as well. Correct me if I'm wrong.
3632,2020-06-06 17:37:24,gxksj8,They are both too old to play Evan in the movie especially considering there is no set date for it to begin production. My favourite person who has played Evan in the musical is 30 but I’m not out here saying he should play him in the movie. It should be teenagers. Unless you’re close to the stage when seeing a musical it’s hard to tell the age of the people up there especially if they can play being young well. In a movie there’s really no hiding that you’re looking at 30 year olds playing someone who is supposed to be 17 and it doesn’t work.
3633,2020-06-08 13:46:44,gxksj8,andrew barth feldman is perfect for the role though
3634,2020-06-06 14:29:41,gxksj8,"Taylor Trensch was 29 when he was Evan.

Maybe the age given during Casting Calls is a general guideline, but not a strict rule. If they find good talent, they can make an exception."
3635,2020-06-07 01:32:38,gxksj8,"Also, remember that casting directors probably weren't on their first rodeo, and know what they're doing! A successful run will be multiple years of rehearsing + performing, so when they're open to audition a 25 year old they know that means they might be working with a 26 or 27 year old (and feel that a person at that age would still well represent their production)"
3636,2020-06-09 23:01:37,gxksj8,Andrew will always be the best Evan
3637,2020-06-06 00:19:34,gxgdg0,Lol wtf?

3682,2020-05-26 09:25:47,gqspj9,Loved it. And the outfit.
3683,2020-05-27 01:57:51,gqspj9,"I adore Ben Platt: his energy, his quirky personality, his goofy sense of style. He’s just adorable. 

I LOVED when he sang ‘River’ on The Politician! 

That said, I found myself fast forwarding through a lot of the songs in the special. I just couldn’t get on board with most of the music but still loved the special."
3684,2020-05-26 07:59:15,gqrhbl,"Everything that has Ryan Murphy’s fingerprint on it is definitely worth a watch.

3728,2020-08-17 23:45:12,ibpft6,Definitely not. I wish they would cast someone who actually looks like a teenager.
3729,2020-08-18 02:38:50,ibpft6,I think he's too old to play Evan I'd prefer a teen
3730,2020-08-18 18:45:08,ibpft6,"LOVE Ben's voice sooo much!! But I always like a new soundtrack, so one that sounds different from the Broadway Recording would be great, since I have that.  
Also, I saw the production with Jordan Fisher and was VERY impressed. Would love to see someone else take the part."
3731,2020-08-18 00:21:32,ibpft6,I’m torn. I always love seeing the original cast but he is too old to play the part. I think it ended up working out okay for the Rent movie though - I mean they were definitely too old but if you just give a little leeway/imagination it’s fine. I guess overall I see it as his part and I’d rather have to imagine a little than not have him immortalized in the role
3732,2020-08-19 06:51:55,ibpft6,[deleted]
3733,2020-08-18 01:25:39,ibpft6,"Yeah, but other than Mimi (“I’m 19 but old for my age”), their ages aren’t specified in **Rent** so it kinda worked whereas **Dear Evan Hansen** specifically happens in high school and Evan is a senior so..."
3734,2020-08-19 06:57:13,ibpft6,Yes of course. Every actor does their own or similar things to show that Evan suffers from anxiety. I have seen multiple Evans and for example Stephen Christopher Anthony would often wipe his palm on his pant leg and cover/rub his eyes when Evan was feeling especially anxious.

3741,2020-08-08 05:49:59,i5q4cm,"omg agree with everything except elphaba tbh. I love lady gaga but I don't think she'd fit that role even tho she has strong vocals....I'd say lea michele for that role but like u said idk if she rlly deserves that rn.....

BUT YES TO JORDAN FISHER. just put jordan fisher in everything and i'll watch. I also love derek klena as fiyero but he's already played that role."
3742,2020-08-08 02:31:32,i5q4cm,[deleted]
3743,2020-08-08 18:19:15,i5q4cm,I feel like they might get an unknown to be Elphaba and cast a bigger name supporting cast. Hairspray and now the new West Side Story have done the same and both of those star young women in the main role (though Elphaba obviously ages quite a lot in the show which might add some difficulty but I imagine putting a younger actor in make-up to look older would be better than an older actress trying to pass for a late teenager at school. Obviously it works fine on stage where we have to suspend our disbelief about basically every part of the story telling but on film is a different story).
3744,2020-08-11 22:23:48,i5q4cm,I’m not sure about the rest of the cast though I really want Dove Cameron to play Glinda and Lea Michele to play Elphaba because they are both the protégés practically of the og duo
3745,2020-08-08 07:05:50,i5q4cm,"Elphaba - Ciara Renee

Glinda - Beanie Feldstein

Fiyero - Ryan McCartan 

Boq - Taylor Trensch 

Nessa - Olivia Rodrigo 

Madame Morrible - Keala Settle

Dr Dillamond - Lin-Manuel Miranda 

The Wizard - Nathan Lane"
3746,2020-08-09 01:56:17,i5q4cm,"Elphaba - Eva Noblezada

Glinda - I genuinely can't think of anyone I 'd want in this role, so I'm hoping they cast a total unknown. 

Fiyero - Jordan Fisher

Nessa - Presley Ryan

Boq - An actual little person in theory, but that could make the tin man thing a bit challenging."
3747,2020-08-08 06:24:44,i5q4cm,By the time they actually make the movie she’ll probably be old enough. I feel like it’s never going to happen
3748,2020-08-08 06:17:05,i5q4cm,"I was trying to think of really big celebs for Elphaba because if they ever make the film, I think they’ll want a big name attached to it. I feel like she’d probably do a pretty decent job though."
3749,2020-08-08 08:10:57,i5q4cm,tbh i dont think barret would do well as nessa
3750,2020-08-08 03:30:46,i5q4cm,"Are you saying Eva Noblezada is mainstream?  NO ONE outside people interested in theater have a clue who she is.  Lady Gaga is mainstream (I can't picture her doing the part, though she definitely has the voice).  I think Anna Kendrick could possible be Elphaba. It's going to be someone big and mainstream, that severely limits the possible options."
3751,2020-08-08 06:23:34,i5q4cm,"I definitely think Dove Cameron would be an obvious choice for Glinda, and I wouldn’t be mad if she played the role. She has the Glinda vibe down tbh. I’d kinda love to see a POC play Glinda, and I think Kimiko Glenn has enough bubbly energy that she would do really well in the role. And since she played Dawn in Waitress I know she can sing pretty well."

3755,2020-08-08 08:25:05,i5q4cm,"As soon as I heard Keala as Madame Thènardier, I thought damn she would be an amazing Madame Morrible."

3785,2020-07-19 00:03:27,htqzrr,"I think self responsibility exists.

Could RIB have stopped her bad and intolerable behavior? Sure. 

Could Lea have not been a terrible person to begin with? Sure."
3786,2020-07-19 00:29:32,htqzrr,"That was Heather Morris’s point. That Lea was (“very much”) unpleasant to work with but that it shouldn’t have been enabled and allowed to continue. 

It was Marti Noxon’s point too. 

I think it was, ultimately, Naya’s stance too. Never forget that she didn’t get in trouble for feuding with Lea but for bringing it up to producers.

Ryan has admitted he made mistakes on Glee. And he claims to be a better person now. 

(To your point about Lauren Potter she posted that she had just talked to Naya on her, Lauren’s, birthday. Whether or not its true that Lea was mean to her I have trouble imagining her keeping in touch and calling her on her birthday years later.)"
3787,2020-07-19 02:11:54,htqzrr,"They should take some blame but at the end of the day, Lea is main personal responsible for her behaviour."
3788,2020-07-19 00:18:59,htqzrr,"i agree that ryan should be called out too, but lea is still the one to be blamed the most for everything that happened"
3789,2020-07-19 00:22:40,htqzrr,"One thing that's always baffled me, why the heck would Cory want/choose to have a relationship with her? From all accounts he was a lovely guy, so why pick the most toxic person to fall in love with?"
3790,2020-07-19 00:36:51,htqzrr,"I'm sure she was toxic when coming into the show, but it sounds like she got so much worse over the seasons. I agree that RIB is partly responsible for that behaviour. They let her do whatever she wanted and listened to her and took her side on everything. She was never reprimanded let alone punished for her behaviour and that is definitely their fault."
3791,2020-07-19 02:08:49,htqzrr,"Obviously Lea is first and foremost to blame for her own behavior. But RIB either ignored it or maybe even encourage it.

As the producers they hold a lot of blame too as do the directors who allow it.

Even if she was  the main character they could have graduated her, but Ryan built a spin off within the show mainly around her and then also hired her for Scream queens.

Ryan must have liked it in some perverse way."
3792,2020-07-19 00:08:13,htqzrr,"ehh, they weren’t going to get rid of Rachel/lea because she was one of the main characters. The story was focused so much on her that they couldn’t just drop her for her shitty behavior. maybe if glee wasn’t so  focused on rachel, she would’ve had less of a presence."
3793,2020-07-19 04:24:40,htqzrr,"Honestly, Ryan gets caught up with his main actors and has a hard time giving others good storylines. Same has happened with AHS (last couple have seasons have been different w/ Jessica Lange out and Sarah and Even taking less of a prominent role)"
3794,2020-07-19 05:23:55,htqzrr,"I mostly blame LEA lmao, but RIB let her ridiculous behavior fly which is unacceptable. We don't know (besides Naya rip) if other cast members took her shit or not. I only hope that between 2009-2015 someone other than Naya put her in her place."
3795,2020-07-19 04:15:00,htqzrr,Lea/Rachel storyline was annoying af. Glee would have been so much better without it.
3796,2020-07-19 05:24:16,htqzrr,If only Lea took accountability lmao.
3797,2020-07-19 21:37:02,htqzrr,"Lea's behaviour was always disgusting, even before Glee, that's on her. Ryan was an enabler to her. Shame on RIB for allowing it to happen for 6 years."
3798,2020-07-19 01:26:45,htqzrr,my thoughts exactly
3799,2020-07-19 03:27:35,htqzrr,"I thought Lauren saying that was so sweet about Naya, it shows how kind Naya was. She really did root for the underdog and treated people with respect. 

I think I heard a friend of Corys friend who worked on another show that was next to Glee that Lea Michele wasn’t nice to Lauren."
3800,2020-07-19 02:13:36,htqzrr,"I agree, she was not a child anymore when she started Glee, it's sooo obvious what she did was extremely horrible, RIB should be called out but she is the one to be blamed most."
3801,2020-07-19 00:35:02,htqzrr,"My guess is he wasn't toxic to her? It's the same with Jon Groff. Everyone says he is the nicest on every situation and they're best friends, before and after Glee. It seems her supe toxic behaviour was mostly centered around female co-stars she percueved as a threat. I wonder most of these instances happened in private (or at least away from Cory and Jon and people) and if she did that on purpose so she could keep up her facade"
3802,2020-07-19 00:42:44,htqzrr,Jenna said in an interview that they made each other better. Perhaps her relationship with him tamed her ‘tude a bit.
3803,2020-07-19 01:10:07,htqzrr,"i mean, i dont wanna make assumptions about their relationship bc we'll never actually know and cory isnt here anymore, but after reading about the story where lea called a girl ugly and cory defended her, also his mom's words that he didnt have the heart to upset anyone or something like that makes me think that cory wasn't blind to lea's attitude and we dont really know how he/they actually felt for each other or if their relationship was as great as it looked from the outside

also yeah she was probably nicer to him bc he was male, hot and she was into him"
3804,2020-07-24 03:50:30,htqzrr,I always kind of assumed it was (at least on some level) a PR relationship. One or both of them may have gotten some kind of financial kickback for holding hands in public. That’s just my theory tho. 🤷‍♀️
3805,2020-07-19 00:15:38,htqzrr,Yeah but Ryan created Glee. He could’ve not focused on Rachel.
3806,2020-07-19 11:51:45,htqzrr,I agree with Lea not needed for Glee to move forward. I can see Laura Belle Bundy or Christy Altomare for the role. But Rachel Berry is essential to  the main plot YET she could've been characterized better. I wonder if  Ian Brennan (the script for Glee before RM was his brainchild) originally wrote Rachel Berry the way she has been for six seasons? I imagine Ryan Murphy did some changes to fit his mean girls/girl fights fetish.
3807,2020-07-21 06:05:17,htqzrr,People in general keep behaving the way they do because they have not faced any consequences for their behavior. She had been that way for years and years. She was not going to stop unless someone held her accountable for her actions.
3808,2020-08-27 02:14:49,htqzrr,"I don’t think Murphy is the good guy helper he says he was. That intervention failed. And if they’d actually had an expert, they would have known there was no way 30 days was enough for rehab. And vacationing & publicity dinners right after getting out is the worst stuff to do. I think he’s a bully who hides behind scripts to fuck with peoples heads. I’m watching glee again and I love hate it. The insults are what get me. They’re real things about the actors. And actors are insecure about everything. So he’s blasting their inner monologues of self hatred for millions to laugh at. And using their friends to do it. And I’m genuinely sorry if this hurts anyone feelings! I’m really new to glee but I’m old enough to remember when something remotely sex positive would send parts of the country into a tizzy. So I give it mad props for that. And maybe 10 years ago was too soon to know you should at least google integrative dance before having an able bodied actor butcher the craft. So maybe that’s almost forgivable. And I realize I’m piling on. I’m sorry. I’m realizing these things just now so I’m questioning myself. But something about all of this and how they treated Naya over her implants! Ignoring her talent! Ok. Sorry. Ranting. 
I’m reading and absorbing so many great posts on here to help me sort out my crazy conflicted feelings about glee. I have time on my hands."
3809,2020-07-19 01:51:50,htqzrr,Chris could be an exception to the female costars only thing since clearly he can meet her range in the vocal department.
3810,2020-07-19 01:55:05,htqzrr,"Yeah, Lea typically gets along with her leading men. Him, Groff and I guess Darren became her “leading man” friendship wise once Cory passed. I would say that Chris was her new leading man since Rachel and Kurt were best friends but it seems she treated him not that great as well, possibly because Chris could be a threat to her vocally."
3811,2020-07-19 15:05:48,htqzrr,"Ian's script for his movie about glee club was totally scrapped.    But he did say later that if they had not found the right person for Rachel they probably would not have made the show at all.

So for the writers Lea and Rachel were  very necessary."
3812,2020-07-19 14:02:48,htqzrr,"She was unnecessary. I still think regardless they show would of been better without  Rachel as a main character and her plot would have been more tolerable. I think this is why I always found glee hard to watch. But granted what do I know. The show did really well. 


But from what I’ve heard. They’ve basically just been rewarding toxic behavior. People like her won’t change until they are no longer being Supported by people. 

Had these people took action and said look your behavior is not ok. We’re reducing your role or eliminating it. She might wake up and change her behavior. But instead they did that to Naya who was simply calling them out on it"
3813,2020-07-19 01:58:00,htqzrr,"Was she bad/mean/toxic to Chris? All I know is that they were super close in season 1, 2 and maybe 3 for sure and then after that I don't see any evidence of their relationship after that - friendship or otherwise. But I also don't know of anything Lea did to him or any proof he dislikes her."
3814,2020-07-19 02:12:06,htqzrr,"I read that she didn’t want to show up to set when Chris was directing an episode, so I’d assume she gave him some trouble."
3815,2020-07-19 02:14:55,htqzrr,"No evidence he dislikes her. But the blow-up that lead to Naya being written out of the season 5 finale and demoted was on the episode Chris wrote. Lea refused to come out of her trailer to film and Naya thought it was disrespectful to Chris, in particular. 

Certainly not the actions of a good friend."
3816,2020-07-19 02:13:11,htqzrr,"Also they all to seem to have handled her very maturely, so idk if all of them actively dislike her."
3817,2020-07-19 02:22:48,htqzrr,"Hmm interesting. Wonder why 

And yeah they did seem to be very mature... or at least quiet about it"
3818,2020-07-19 02:22:04,htqzrr,Ah okay I didn't know that. Interesting
3819,2020-07-19 02:23:43,htqzrr,"She seemed to only be really awful to her female costars, so I assume anyone who was a threat to her vocally. Chris would fall under the vocal department if that were the case."
3820,2020-07-19 02:26:13,htqzrr,"Chris made a point of saying Naya spoke truth to power in his tribute to her too. And that being close to her was a suit of armor. 

Not that I mean he was thinking of Lea. But I do think he was thinking of that incident."
3821,2020-07-19 02:25:19,htqzrr,I suppose but... like why? I guess that's something we'll never know
3822,2020-07-19 03:54:36,htqzrr,"I thought this, too."
3823,2020-07-19 02:40:15,htqzrr,Hmm I feel like it's a little bit of a stretch to assume that's what he was talking about but in general I'm sure he believed that about Naya
3824,2020-07-19 02:26:28,htqzrr,I guess she felt she needed to be in control and make sure her career launched from this. So she viewed it as a competition.
3825,2020-07-19 02:40:41,htqzrr,Yeah I guess. Just seems so weird to me since she had a career before Glee. Seems super unnecessary
3826,2020-07-19 04:40:44,htqzrr,"It is unnecessary. The rumors go back to when she was 12 though, I’m guessing she thought if it worked for her then she should continue to be that way in order to get what she wants."
3827,2020-07-19 11:09:56,htqzrr,Yeah that's true. Just sucks :( like hey maybe don't be a terrible person??
3828,2020-07-17 17:32:55,hsv74m,"Super cool list, thanks for sharing! My favorites here are Alvin, Emil, Leroy and Jerome. My dad always liked Otis a lot and I don’t hate it :) Also love Edgar with my whole heart, but I’m biased as heck because that’s future son #2’s name :) :)

Terribly curious about Lawrence “Leon”...I wonder if that was his middle name or Leon is a diminutive/nickname of Lawrence."

Regarding Lawrence ""Leon""...his full name was Lawrence Edward Joseph Feuerbach, so I'm assuming that Leon didn't come from either of his middle names. I have no idea how Lawrence turned into Leon. So weird!"
3831,2020-07-22 22:22:41,hsv74m,"TBH, my love for the Olympics started when my mom (homeschool teacher) gave me a CD-Rom about Olympic history to explore, and (thinking it was just an important thing for me to learn) unknowingly began what would become a lifelong passion for me."
3832,2020-07-17 20:06:19,hsv74m,I love it! Names are so weird because it could be quite literally ANYTHING: did a grandparent mistake his name so often that it stuck? Did a younger sibling call him that as the closest they could get to pronouncing Larry? People think my name is Jenny sometimes because my grandmother calls all the girl children the same name as oldest granddaughter lol!

3835,2020-07-11 05:01:05,hp28o4,This is one of my favorite songs. Ben Platt actually said he wrote it from the perspective of the person he was breaking up with. It’s heartbreaking when we can’t understand the reason why and feel like they don’t understand that there’s an ability to grow with us. But in reality the dumper knows that it’s an option and chose not too. Gives a sense of clarity and finality
3836,2020-07-11 02:27:10,hp28o4,"I don’t know what this sub is but what you wrote is how I felt recently. Girlfriend of 8 years broke up with me over text. I felt the same way you do after being told she needs to grow herself and can’t do it in a relationship. 

Now she’s already dating someone else 3 months later and I found out she had been cheating on me. 

Fuck em. You can do better. If they’re meant to be, then they could definitely change themselves by your side. They’re usually just too spineless/confused to figure out what they want or to tell you the truth."

3852,2020-09-04 22:57:33,imq4nw,"I agree. As far as I can tell, they’re both incredibly talented, but I think that Ben Platt is just getting too old for the role."
3853,2020-09-04 23:00:16,imq4nw,"As much as I think Ben Platt is too old for the role, he did a fine job with The Politician and I believe it will be good in the end.

You’re not going to find a stage-to-screen adaptation that doesn’t add or subtract things. It’s necessary when going from one medium to another. Trust the creators, be hopeful, and go in with an open mind."

Both had their break out roles in 2012 movies 

Amandla played a 12 year old and Ben played a college student.

He's just too old"
3857,2020-09-05 21:59:19,imq4nw,"Although I agree that bens too old, getting to see him reprise his role as Evan still feels like such a treat. And in my opinion, there’s no voice like his when it comes to Evans. I was talking to a friend who doesn’t know much about musicals and she didn’t see any problem with Ben doing it (so i think it’s mostly just us theatre folks that are bothered by it). If anything I’m a lot more worried about the “step father” role.... 

But also, everyone needs to wait to see it. These decisions have already been made and it’s truly out of our control now. The movie has the potential to fix a lot of things and even if they add new issues, it’ll be interesting to see more of this world regardless. If the movie is truly horrible then I’ll just pretend like it never happened 😂"
3858,2020-09-05 15:25:34,imq4nw,I agree that Andrew would be great but I think he just started college which is why he left the show in the first place. I also think that they are aware of how old ben looks so they will try to age him down (hopefully better than in the politician). I do agree that he is too old and that they should find a younger actor but he is also a fantastic evan.
3859,2020-09-05 18:38:56,imq4nw,"one word: egot. in my opinion, ben probably wants an egot (i dont blame him who doesnt) and hes like one away. plus if the movie’s good, he’ll probably win the oscar"

3906,2020-09-01 11:29:26,if88qt,"Took me a bit to think this through, but I've come up with something.

Waving Through a Window is Evan's internal monologue, and as the song goes on, he gets more desperate and realizes how alone he feels he is (whether or not he actually is, considering his mother had been trying to get through to him for the better part of his teenage years). The power he puts into that word could be interpreted as an unexpected moment of coherent anger in this otherwise anxiety-ridden person, which makes sense because again this is his own internal monologue and not something anyone else is hearing."

Whilst being a very good singer, what struck me most was the little quirks he added to his performance. Very subtle things like thumbing his thigh, clenching his hands (which as a fellow social anxiety sufferer also does) those pauses and notes that is less 'Showy' and more character driven."
3908,2020-09-03 12:55:29,if88qt,"Fully agree with your theory, and it makes sense when put alongside the staging - like, when Evan runs through the line formed by the other characters, they turn the other way, almost as though no matter how hard he wants people to notice him, they don't.

Play a traditionally masculine, out of touch blue collar type, or something else that is a world away from who you are in day to day. Show the people for whom you are auditioning some of your range of depth. 

You do not want to get pigeonholed. I have worked in theatre, and know it can be hard. I have a very talented, very effeminate male friend and he's continually overlooked because he can't play straight. He is balls out gay in whatever he does, which is awesome because he's being himself, but limits his casting opportunities for sure."

4002,2020-09-23 17:38:45,iy35hv,"As someone who watches bootlegs… I really don’t understand why more shows aren’t professionally recorded and released later. It would make Broadway so much more accessible to people who can’t afford tickets to the live show (which is quite a few people- Those things are expensive!). Broadway is really elitist despite trying to be inclusive in casting and in storytelling. 

Obviously the quality is never great, and you’re likely to get a few minutes of black screen while the bootlegger hides their phone, but it’s worth it to at least hear the live music and dialogue that you don’t get from a cast recording (if there is one).

I have immense respect for the work put into each show by cast and crew, but I don’t think bootlegging is truly harming anyone, maybe other than the person who has to watch bootlegger record the show. Here’s hoping Covid will be a wake-up call to the Broadway world that distributing professionally recorded shows would actually be a really popular decision."
4003,2020-09-23 05:37:36,iy35hv,"This was a very interesting post. There have been a few Broadway musicals that I would have loved to see but I didn't want to have to fly to New York or find where they were performing to go see them. I really wish The Book of Mormon could have been filmed so that I could see it. I find it very interesting how different Broadway musicals are compared to movies and other types of media. In my opinion I think that Broadway musicals are behind the curve technologically. They have to realize that these bootlegs are basically showing a demand for people to see a performance that is not live. I don't think I'm the only one that believes that they would want to see these musicals without having to spend a ton of money on a ticket let alone fly out to go see it. By filming and distributing an official release of the musical, Broadway could make much more money. That is why in my opinion I believe Broadway musicals are really lacking when it comes to the technological advancements that most other forms of media have gotten."
4004,2020-09-27 05:52:04,iy35hv,"This post reminds me of much of the discussion through this weeks lectures questioning if it is reasonable to bootleg or ""steal"" content online when it is not easily accessible. While I understand that production company's must generate revenue to continue to produce new content, I do not think that bootlegging plays and musicals specifically is all that detrimental to the business. As you talked about in your post, most people simply do not have access to this type of entertainment in the areas they live. Furthermore, there is limited capacity to these events, and they are usually not performed for a very long period of time. If people have no other way of accessing a play or musical than through a bootleg recording, then they are at least fulfilling their interest in the production, and may be encouraged to pay money to see the show in person when they get the chance."
4005,2020-09-23 05:48:50,iy35hv,"Yeah theater likes to represent the old days when the only entertainment you had in town was a theater. You would think that they would want to expose themselves on the internet, but they don't see it that way. Also it ruins the fact they may want to have ticket sales because once it is seen on the internet there is no one that would want to pay money to see it live."
4006,2020-09-23 06:55:01,iy35hv,[deleted]
4007,2020-09-28 22:05:57,iy35hv,"I think a big part of this is that those in the ""legitimate theater"" (and I am not about to open up the drama/musical debate) see a big part of what they do as being tied to the live event. They consider it part of their mission to get people to come out to the theater, and they see the reproduction of this to be not just a watering down of live performance, but actually dissuading people from attending live theater.

My wife and I met in our undergrad acting program and we were regular theater goers in Manhattan, at least until we had kids. With the kids, this question has changed a bit. I doubt I would have spent money on tickets for the kids to go and see Pirates of Penzance. But they sat through the movie. I definitely wouldn't have risked Hamilton, but they have watched it on repeat since it came out via streaming. 

So I am very much of two minds here. I can fully understand why they don't want bootlegs *or* professional recordings. And I don't think it is because they are money grubbing artists: with rare exceptions no one gets rich in theater. But I do get the question of democratization. Attending theater has gotten very expensive. I think the solution to that is to increase the supply of live theater!

\+ Insightful and unique perspective, well explained."
4008,2020-09-23 22:09:33,iy35hv,"I love musicals, But most of the musicals that I love, are no longer showing or have tickets that are insanely expensive. I also don't see the harm of bootlegging musicals, because I watch them all the time on YouTube. Sometimes it's the only way I can watch a musical that is no longer in production.   


But in a more responsible viewpoint, It makes sense that this stuff get's taken down or removed. I think in some way's its considered Markey harm, But at the same time Its not? I guess this is because once a musical is gone and no longer show's its gone gone, and the only way to listen is on Spotify or other legal music sources. (Which isn't the same as watching the actual musical).   


I think the release of Hamilton on Disney Plus was the greatest idea people have had in awhile, and i hope other's take note and do the same. Cause like you said, It would be a popular decision, and make many people who cant afford 500$ tickets super happy and help the industry a lot."
4009,2020-09-28 22:06:38,iy35hv,\+ Makes good use of paragraphs or other elements to present and scan clearly online.
4010,2020-09-23 08:14:12,iy35hv,"""It ruins the fact they may want to have ticket sales because once it is seen on the internet there is no one that would want to pay money to see it live"" is one of the largest arguments and in theory, it makes all the sense in the world. 

It just ignores the fact people will still see Oklahoma! or West Side Story or Hamlet live despite there being film adaptations (all three being popular in NYC this past year). It's the same as sure I could watch a concert on YouTube but the quality is nowhere near seeing the band live."
4011,2020-09-23 21:27:57,iy35hv,"Yet, if someone else runs an identical show and puts it up on the internet, there exists a nearly identical experience than if they themselves put their own content on the internet. Besides, I think the whole notion of physical exclusivity that these theater houses seem to cling to is a bit antiquated to say the least. I suspect this is out of fear, as theater has become a more niche form of entertainment than any other form of mass media, although there does still exist a base that is wholly willing to pay for it, and such users are unlikely to forgo the experience of live theater for what is effectively online video."
4012,2020-09-23 07:10:23,iy35hv,"You're right. The fact that someone else publicly announced it first does give a different tone. I'll edit it to make it clearer. Thank you for pointing that out (also in 2019 he said he was going to see the show for the [29th time](https://twitter.com/bensplatt/status/1119037234303438848?lang=en). That's a lot!)

But I think it is the same because even though his father Marc Platt produced it, I'm pretty sure that doesn't make it completely okay for Ben. I think every argument used against bootlegs would still be applicable (not supporting the current actors, don't have the consent of the actors, supporting someone doing something illegal). Morally he may be better than your average bootleg consumer (I don't have a moral objection to begin with tbh)?

I'd love to hear your thought on it!"
4013,2020-09-27 05:57:35,iy35hv,"I do not understand why the bootlegging of musicals is frowned up so intensely by the industry, especially if they do not do much recording themselves. It seems to me that the ability to watch a show online would only intensify someone's interest to eventually see it in person. The experience itself is impossible to replicate, but passionate fans of a production should not be punished for their interest. In most industries, the more attention a product can garner, the more units it will be able to sell. I would imagine that this principle stays true for the play and musical industry."
4014,2020-09-28 22:07:21,iy35hv,\+ Nice response / conversation.
4015,2020-09-23 07:25:28,iy35hv," I can't believe I did this but I did actually search his twitter and he has tweeted about boots before he was an actor but mostly in a joking sense enough. One was ""while I'm disappointed that you have no bootlegs for me, I understand completely. I wouldn't have been able to move either"" and the other ""Cough, Cough. A BARRINGTON BOOTLEG?"" He was young when he made the tweets though so *he could have fully changed his mind on the general bootleg community*. Just thought you mind find it interesting! I know, it's a bit gossipy. I felt fifteen finding it."

4019,2020-09-20 01:54:55,ivzwne,Lana Del Ray’s Once Upon A Dream is perfect! Its on my playlist while I’m playing my cannon run through. “Marked for Death” by Emma Ruth Rundle is another good angsty one.
4020,2020-09-20 12:54:52,ivzwne,"this is such a coincidence because i just made my Solavellan playlist today!

landfill - daughter

king and lionheart - of monsters and men"
4021,2020-09-27 23:14:08,ivzwne,"Personally, I like ""Can You Hold Me"" by NF for... pretty much any passionate and/or angsty relationship. If two people crave each other and there's something in the way? BAM! Hit play. That song is life. 

For Solavellan, my head puts it more in the Fade. After the split when she's seeing him in her dreams. He needs her too much to stay away and she aches to be in his arms again. The way it starts so softly and just builds... Like glimpsing him through trees you can only halfway remember. Being drawn closer and closer by feelings neither of you can resist and crashing together. Then the slow fade at the end is like waking softly to the dawn.

Or something equally sappy and poetic. Stupid sexy eggboy. Making me get all dramatic."
4022,2020-09-19 20:32:03,ivzwne,"I have no doubt that these songs are thematically appropriate, and I appreciate the effort you put into this playlist, except my taste in music is quite different :("
4023,2020-09-23 00:37:36,ivzwne,"oh shit that’s so perfect GAH!! And the funny thing is, that was one of my all-time favorite songs when I was a teenager. For whatever reason, despite its perfection, it never even crossed my mind lol. Thank you for reminding me of it."
4024,2020-09-23 00:44:43,ivzwne,"Thank you for the rec! And I am happy to share:

In my personal headcanon, I imagine that DA4 (though we will play as a new protag) will see the Inquisitor working against Solas in some way. So for my romanced Lavellan who will do everything she can to redeem him, she will be working against him in the shadows with her own trusted team - Inq. is disbanded. (Soldier, Love and War)

I think most would agree Lavellan is the perfect antagonist/foil for him because she knows him better than anyone, and I picture her being a thorn in his side that he is unwilling to ...pluck :) I think he would hesitate to mount a direct attack against her and her forces, but that something forces the battle, and they fight (Villain). And it’s angsty but also exciting because they know each others' moves so fundamentally well and it's more contact that they’ve had in forever so it’s also, uh, kinda hot? XD

Which I think leads to Solas visiting her when no one else is around and she doesn’t have access to telling anyone about him...so maybe the fade, but I’m thinking also in reality...and they become each others’ (Bad Habit) XD. Lavellan still wants to save him (Undisclosed Desires) but is questioning the wisdom of all this (How Deep is Too Deep). Finally Solas, as usual, is the one to call it off (when the party’s over) and Lavellan is finally like,"" SRSLLY AGAIN?!? okay fine, you wanna play it that way (Walk on By), you mofo. i love you, but i don't. but i do (Poison & Wine).""

Then I think she is numbly resigned (Black Flies) to the idea that she will probably have to kill him, and she will keep “running with the wolves” i.e. fighting him and his forces. (The Wolf)

Then, in this headcanon world, he fails to bring down the veil. I don’t believe that he would realistically stop of his own accord - I just imagine he fails/is stopped. But, he doesn’t die - he escapes. I feel that only after the possibility of bringing back his world is taken away from him completely can he begin to release his feeling of duty/obligation and truly mourn his lost world...as well as mourn what destruction he has wrought in this one. And wish for Lavellan to save him, as he’s wished deep down all along but never let the idea completely form (Make This Go On Forever).

After coming out of hiding years later Solas is reunited with Lavellan and everything about her brings all the feelings rushing back as if it were yesterday. (Stolen Away on 55th & 3rd)

(Me in Twenty Years) Lavellan is understandably jaded at this point. Always questioning herself and feeling guilty and conflicted about everything. But even though it’s been years and she had difficulty forgiving him, her love is still so deep and consuming...and she wants to try again, with him (Once Upon A Dream).

...but the sad thing is, now that they are finally ready to have their happy ending, she is already in her mid-life and both are keenly aware of just how little time they have left together. TOO BAD IT TOOK YOU SO LONG TO GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR ASS, EGG. But at least they get to be together, for a time. I conceive of this as a reward of sorts for Lavellan, who has gone through so much and finally gets to be with a Solas who isn’t anything other than what he says he is. And the inevitable death of Lavellan might be a fitting punishment for Solas; he’s immortal after all, and if he was caught and killed within Lavellan’s lifetime, well...i just don't think that would be fair to our bbygirl. It's only a few decades of living in hiding, anyway, grand scheme of things... So. What happens to him after Lavellan dies is anyone’s guess!

I personally vacillate between being a Solas apologist (wanting Lavellan to join him to bring back Elvhenan and find a way to survive the coming destruction RAWR ELVHEN GLORY!!), and decidedly not.

Anyway. That’s basically it XD (it's rather boring compared to other ppl's headcanons i know but that's just the way i imagined things playing out when making this playlist, at any rate)"

But I also think Kristin Chenoweth would make a good Madame Morribile"
4039,2020-09-08 22:39:09,ioxhcz,Upvoting just because of the Jeff Goldblum idea.
4040,2020-09-08 17:20:08,ioxhcz,The only comment I would make is that I agree that Nessarose would probably be too small of a role for Zendaya. I’ve never heard anyone suggest this but I actually think zendaya would probably be a fabulous elphaba!
4041,2020-09-08 18:30:02,ioxhcz,"Ooh I love this. I might throw in Samantha Barks as Elphaba, Helena Bonham Carter as Madame Morrible, and Melissa Benoist as Nessarose (although she is older than both Lindsay Pearce and Samantha Barks... hmm). I love Dove as Galinda and think she would be great but for whatever reason people seem to not like her? I think it would be cool if Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth played Elphaba and Galinda's moms respectively (I know Galinda's mom doesn't appear in the show but they could write a tiny scene for her)"
4042,2020-09-09 05:26:55,ioxhcz,"Wow, hilarious to look back now at how much better the *Glee Project* runners-up did in life than the winners!"
4043,2020-09-08 18:28:25,ioxhcz,"There is NO way  Universal (the show's biggest producer) is going to cast an unknown in the lead of the most anticipated movie musical of a generation. I could also Definitely see Zendaya as Elphaba, and if her career stays on the track it's on, she's the most obvious choice. Jordan Fisher is not nearly a big enough name, and he doesn't really scream ""hunky leading man."" If anything, he would be well-cast as Boq. As for Ben Platt, if he survives all the spackle and filters they're going to have to put on him in DEH to convincingly play 17 (oof) he could easily be in the movie (his dad is a big producer--maybe even with Universal?) but I don't know if he's the right fit for the material."
4044,2020-09-09 01:49:37,ioxhcz,"What about, Hugh Jackman or Richard Gere as the Wizard? Meryl would make a great Morrible, or possibly Imelda Staunton. Idina Menzel and Norbert Leo Butz as Elphaba's parents."
4045,2020-09-09 22:27:44,ioxhcz,"Whoever they choose have to honor the originals, and Idina and Kristin have to be part of it somehow.  Write parts for them, they must be acknowledged!"
4046,2020-09-10 08:47:42,ioxhcz,"Thank you for being original and (while she still may have a Glee connection) choosing a dream Elphaba casting that isn't Lea Michele or Ariana Grande (I would want to see her tackle some Broadway role again but my dream casting for her isn't Elphaba, it's Persephone in Hadestown)"
4047,2020-09-08 22:13:45,ioxhcz,"I was going to say Lindsay Pearce as Elphaba when I saw the title :) Is Dove Cameron really a strong enough singer for Glinda? If she is, fine with me, but I do want that role to be sung well. I always thought Katie Hall would be a good Glinda.

Wicked is such a huge property that I feel like they could afford to cast relative unknowns in the lead and then fill up the supporting cast with bigger names, but we'll see if they do that (if that movie ever actually gets made, they've been talking about it forever)."
4048,2020-09-11 20:54:17,ioxhcz,"Elphaba - Emmy Raver-Lampman 

Glinda - Beanie Feldstein 

Madame Morrible - Keala Settle

Fiyero - Jordan Fisher 

Nessarose - Olivia Rodrigo

The Wizard - Nathan Lane

Boq - Andy Mientus"

4086,2020-10-26 22:04:46,jing2j,"I disagree. I don't think it needs a total reboot. More an N'Sane-style remake. Fix up the controls, redo the cutscenes, and keep the level design intact."
4087,2020-10-26 23:35:24,jing2j,No thank you. Just give me a collection with Tron Boone and Im fine maybe some of the fix they put on the PSP version to help the gameplay flow better and  maybe a way to make the textures look a litter better.
4088,2020-10-26 21:43:52,jing2j,Completely agreed! The legends franchise is so underrated and a reboot in an age like this should help making it more known and fix the outdated stuff

4124,2020-12-08 17:29:01,k8xdrt,Pretty sure that Unique and Harmony had that duet because Alex and Lindsay (their actors) were the Glee Project finalists.
4125,2020-12-08 04:51:39,k8xdrt,"really? I can't stand how they make kurt sing, it's not even the pitch it's kind of like the chipmunk song but sounds wet. He does the same thing when he takes quinn's part in MWDOTY, and it's just hard to listen to"
4126,2020-12-06 16:08:03,k7w907,"high school

RM tweeted early in the year about remaking glee with lea and ben platt and... it did not go down well, and certainly hasn't aged well since he listed a bunch of other people for other roles and lea was the *only* OG"

4128,2020-12-06 16:20:18,k7w907,"I think he ended up deleting it after all the evidence against Lea came out.

4131,2020-12-06 16:33:45,k7w907,">It was so incredibly rude considering...

it was just incredibly rude in general, when most of your cast are still alive and thriving, you say you wished you'd been able to do it with other people! and only keep around the one you know made the set hell for everyone else?! and specifically highlight someone to play the part of a character whose original actor is dead!!? IDK why he thought it was a good idea to tweet that *at all*

>I think he ended up deleting it after all the evidence against Lea came out

he deleted it after naya died, it was still there in the middle/end of june"
4132,2020-12-06 16:25:36,k7w907,"I think *if* a reboot were to happen, it should be in another decade or so and with no OGs"
4133,2020-12-06 18:40:12,k7w907,It could be argued that Chris was the reason why the show was so successful. So many of the most iconic characters and storylines wouldn’t have existed without him.
4134,2020-12-06 18:07:33,k7w907,He was only joking.
4135,2020-12-06 16:35:39,k7w907,"I think they could do a good reboot with some of the OGs, seeing sam take over the reins of the glee club if it's got the same tone as early S1. have it be a bit like what S6 was doing but with better split of kids' stories and what the OGs now the adults of the show are doing. I don't like the thing HSM did in the third movie with the same school and just finding a different generation to tell the same story - it's what they tried with glee S4 and we all know how that went down"
4136,2020-12-06 18:13:22,k7w907,"Obviously he was joking about a reboot, but it was still pretty rude that his tweet suggested erasing the contributions of the actual cast. It’s just something he should not have tweeted."
4137,2020-12-06 16:51:57,k7w907,"That sounds pretty good. My reservation though is this: seeing some OGs reminds me of the OGs that we won’t get back ever. It would feel like something essential was missing. That’s why I think doing it in 2030 or 2040 may be fresher. 

But if I had to lobby for something to be released soon, it’d be a behind the scenes documentary about the show. There *must* be some footage. Recording studio footage, bloopers, behind the scenes of the tour, audition footage, table read footage, etc."

4139,2020-12-06 16:58:55,k7w907,"yes, unfortunately, which is why they probably can't do it unless it really is other adults and just will as principal, sam as glee club director (with quinn as his girlfriend maybe), and maybe kurt visiting burt appearing from the OGs. none of the every-other-week reunions, which were generally done badly, and would make the missing OGs obvious"

Not to mention that a few of them also started to put in effort to see live concerts for a few of the performers.

The same thing can be applied to the official video release of Cats from the 90's. If not for that vhs tape my sister would not have paid to see that damn show live twice (or even once.)"

Last place I expected a quality musical but there it was. But I still agree because regardless of availability, theatre is still a very class divided thing and the art is in the performance. Seeing a grainy bootleg of Legally Blonde didnt really give me the theatre experience it just gave me context to the story and songs. Now that I was able to view the musical for free on YouTube  if given the opportunity I'd totally go to a performance of it."

4200,2020-11-16 18:31:35,jv66oa,Did he get it at the end of May or early June?
4201,2020-11-16 13:55:04,jv66oa,"Who gives a bleep when a celebrity gets COVID, “Oh they reveal they got diagnosed or had it” big deal, I had it and people in my family had it, I don’t see big media corps telling everyone in the nation we had it, and I don’t go around the streets and social media “coming out about having COVID” it’s just so stupid, how about post and write about the people who’s lives are a stake so they can get help from others and even go fund me pages"
4202,2020-11-16 15:35:21,jv66oa,Website is mobile cancer don't open
4203,2020-11-17 00:23:10,jv66oa,"I really wish that celebrities would announce WHEN they are diagnosed. Let people live through your experience. It is that much more real then - don't wait until everything is peachy and then say ""yeah, I had it months and months ago but I'm fine now - wear a mask!"""
4204,2020-11-16 21:03:02,jv66oa,Well done
4205,2020-11-16 15:06:23,jv66oa,"I think the idea is to make people realize that the celebrities they admire and are obsessed with aren't untouchable to the virus and that people should take it seriously. Look at Jeremih, he's on a ventilator in the ICU right now, and he's 33."
4206,2020-11-16 14:07:27,jv66oa,I agree but look at the US. We elected a reality star as president. If famous people get regular joes to take it seriously I’m all for it.
4207,2020-11-16 15:04:39,jv66oa,Agreed except for Tom Hanks
4208,2020-11-16 17:28:48,jv66oa,To be fair to Ben Platt most people outside of broadway fandom have zero idea who he is.
4209,2020-11-16 19:48:26,jv66oa,"Because they know they have influence over their fans and want to assure that they take it seriously? I’m willing to bet at least one person had their mind changed because of this, even if it’s not the best reason"
4210,2020-11-16 16:20:34,jv66oa,"Celeb, average joe, rich, poor, smart, dumb...it can happen to anybody."
4211,2020-11-16 14:05:56,jv66oa,"I agree thanks, and I’m happy you survived and the people in your family did too! Cheers!"
4212,2020-11-16 15:28:19,jv66oa,"Well yeah but most of them (at least 99%) they put an article up of a lot of actors who were like “yeah it was awful, I couldn’t leave the house and had to paint for 4 days while I watched movies on 5 different televisions while I had a sore throat, make sure u take this seriously” meanwhile there’s immunocompromised people who are stuck in the hospital or live in a small home and literally have to pick paint off the wall for 2 weeks"
4213,2020-11-16 14:43:35,jv66oa,Well of course it’s helpful but it’s not as convincing to show a celebrity smiling in their million dollar home than to show someone the mortality of their mistakes if you don’t follow the guidelines
4214,2020-11-16 15:17:28,jv66oa,His diagnosis knocked over all the dominoes in March.  It was crazy how quickly everything moved after that.
4215,2020-11-16 18:23:08,jv66oa,Fair point
4216,2020-11-17 02:59:55,jv66oa,"Guess im the only one that watches ""the politician"""
4217,2020-11-16 21:48:26,jv66oa,"Well obviously, but narrative is important, if you want to genuinely convince people you have to make your experience serious or don’t say anything at all, it does the opposite when someone like Jim Parsons is explaining to the world that his diagnosis sucked because he “had to find new hobbies like paint classes and watch new things online” and not because he thought he was gonna die or couldn’t breathe"
4218,2020-11-16 16:36:17,jv66oa,"Yes, but the results and dealing with the virus are written as though they had no troubles at all, and “revealing” the contraction is like a game to them"
4219,2020-11-16 14:40:30,jv66oa,Thank you!
4220,2020-11-16 18:44:11,jv66oa,[deleted]
4221,2020-11-16 16:07:16,jv66oa,"Honestly yeah. If Tom Hanks and other celebs hadn’t gotten it and posted about it publicly and if the NBA hadn’t shut down, I honestly think we would have been in for a bigger shitstorm earlier."
4222,2020-11-16 18:46:12,jv66oa,"Alright fair point, I retire my argument"
4223,2020-12-23 23:42:15,kj3ok3,"I don’t have it, but if you try searching for the Joni Mitchell version (I can’t remember if they’re a little different) that might help!
Edit: she’s the original songwriter"
4224,2020-12-23 23:44:11,kj3ok3,"Okay, thanks."
4225,2020-12-24 20:37:17,kj3ok3,"I could get the Joni Mitchell version... any interest?

I could get either of these versions if you want to check them out first:

[1](https://freshsheetmusic.com/joni-mitchell-river-99459/) and [2](https://freshsheetmusic.com/joni-mitchell-river-26391/)

I did notice that the Ben Platt version looks like its in G major and the Joni Mitchell versions look like they're in C major. Are you cool with them being in C major or would you rather me transpose them up for you? I could manage either way"
4226,2020-12-24 21:28:00,kj3ok3,"I've already found it, thanks"
4227,2020-12-24 21:53:47,kj3ok3,No worries - Merry Christmas!
4228,2020-12-22 11:50:04,kh4h7s,"This was so beautiful and just so heartfelt
I sent you something I don't know if you're going to reply or not but I just wanted to let you know that you are a beautiful soul"
4229,2020-12-21 19:46:23,kh4h7s,Reminds me of pinky and brain what are we doing tonight brain ? Same thing we do every night pinky !!! TRYING TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD!!!
4230,2021-02-01 04:26:15,kh4h7s,26 san Antonio Texas feel free to hmu and see where things go by you seem like a pritty cool person to be friends with
4231,2020-12-21 03:03:23,kh4h7s,Count me in!!
4232,2020-12-21 06:16:18,kh4h7s,"I don’t know if I can see a relationship with you..

God that was a horrible pun. I’m going to hell."
4233,2020-12-20 23:19:12,kh4h7s,How many boyfriends have you had?
4234,2020-12-19 09:02:19,kg43n3,"Yess, I totally agree"
4235,2021-01-02 13:42:07,kfd1ls,"I hope she calls you! If not, her loss!"
