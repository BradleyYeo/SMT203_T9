1,2020-02-04 17:49:56,eysvkd,I totally agree! I could even say it’s my favorite in the whole soundtrack. It is very relatable in my opinion
2,2020-02-04 20:45:30,eysvkd,"I usually do not cry when I’m watching movies/shows, but this song just beat me to it. Beautifully sung by Olivia, beautiful song, just beautiful."
3,2020-02-04 19:06:25,eysvkd,It's currently my to go song together with Born To Be Brave and All I Want
4,2020-02-05 03:13:17,eysvkd,it’s one of my favorites as well! definitely fitting for a new year! it’s very refreshing
5,2020-02-07 02:28:45,eysvkd,This is one of my favourites this season

9,2020-02-05 16:24:41,evhlh6,I feel like she would be a genuine awesome person to hang out with
10,2020-01-22 23:04:14,esj9kb,"110K after six weeks? I'll be honest out of all the new-ish wave of rappers, didn't expect Roddy to be this successful. Nothing but congrats to him."
11,2020-01-22 22:33:18,esj9kb,"This is Mac's highest charting track as the lead artist, I wish he was here to see this, and more importantly, it upsets me a tad bit that he had to die in order to reach this level of recognition when he always deserved it."
12,2020-01-22 23:46:44,esj9kb,"What are Future’s other top 10s? I’m guessing Jumpman and Mask Off?

Edit: it’s actually Mask Off and Love Me"
13,2020-01-22 23:17:49,esj9kb,Futsal Shuffle is floppin
14,2020-01-22 22:36:14,esj9kb,"I feel like High Fashion's gonna blow up soon, such a nice track"
15,2020-01-22 22:36:52,esj9kb,"Lmaooo selena won by 2k. Would have been like The Travis/Nicki situation, but better since Roddy's project has been charting for 6 weeks.

Also, didn't expect Life is Good to chart that high. It kinda grew on me"
16,2020-01-23 00:31:33,esj9kb,"How much are you guys expecting for Em and Mac?

I think Mac is gonna be around 100-130K

Em on the other hand is expected to be at 300-320K, but I think he'll do higher numbers. Maybe around 400K."
17,2020-01-23 07:17:29,esj9kb,"Nighty night, Old Town Road. What a fuckin' run though"
18,2020-01-22 23:07:27,esj9kb,Thirty-six Top 10s for Drake. Shit brazy.
19,2020-01-22 23:06:03,esj9kb,"Bieber going on SNL on Feb 8 which likely means album coming Friday Feb 7. Wonder if we get another single before then or they ride Yummy into it's release. Pretty sure they banked on a #1 single, wonder how they feel now."
20,2020-01-23 00:31:43,esj9kb,Brockhampton really has a rising hit. You love to see it.
21,2020-01-22 23:10:56,esj9kb,I wonder how close Life is good was to The Box in getting #1
22,2020-01-23 00:00:53,esj9kb,[deleted]
23,2020-01-23 01:39:23,esj9kb,"I had no idea moneybagg yo was that big. Damn. Props to him. 

Too bad his AMA was shit."
24,2020-01-23 02:33:48,esj9kb,That Dance Monkey song is absolute ass
25,2020-01-23 02:24:47,esj9kb,"Hot Girl Bummer is still rising, that song has some long legs"
26,2020-01-22 22:26:16,esj9kb,Fuckin Selena and her fake humble beg for streams.
27,2020-01-23 00:02:12,esj9kb,"Okay so I just want to make clear. How long as The Box been charting at #1 and is it still there? Also does Selena have the #1 album and also beat Roddy’s album now? 

Thank you"
28,2020-01-23 00:08:13,esj9kb,are #1s just so artists feel great to have the accolade or is there any actual benefit to it like how some nba players get incentivized for making all-nba teams?
29,2020-01-23 04:44:33,esj9kb,The Weeknd really came and went. Ya hate to see it
30,2020-01-23 00:12:36,esj9kb,Why aren’t any songs from Eminem’s album on here? Godzilla is doing great on streaming..? I must be missing something
31,2020-01-23 00:04:07,esj9kb,"A huge chunk of that is down to The Box and the streaming push on social media though isn't it? Without this wave and the war against Bieber and Selena Gomez I think it would've come down with time like a regular album, probably doing 35-40k this week"
32,2020-01-23 08:53:36,esj9kb,That’s huge after 6 weeks.. please take in Selena beat him by just 2k. She easily bought that herself as we saw in her sad ass video driving around.
33,2020-01-23 01:41:22,esj9kb,"He had a number one album when he was still a kid. Every album he dropped after that sold a little less than the one before it, because he slowly moved away from the pop music he made on BSP. He didn't seem to care about the charts."
34,2020-01-23 01:00:02,esj9kb,How tf was Low Life not top 10? People really sleep on Future
35,2020-01-23 00:11:01,esj9kb,damn who would have thought that a bad song flops because people dont listen to it after the initial hype... uzi should have just put out a banger instead of a 2004 mtv phone ringtone ad
36,2020-01-23 05:18:22,esj9kb,"Not surprised, the Uzi hype could only push it so far. Listened to it a few times and it never really grew on me"
37,2020-01-22 23:58:50,esj9kb,"As it should, song was ass compared to Uzi's past singles"
38,2020-01-23 00:08:27,esj9kb,"I really hope so, wish he would have dropped a video for this instead of boom boom room"
39,2020-01-23 02:16:32,esj9kb,It’s been stuck in my head for days!!! It’s so good
40,2020-01-23 02:30:25,esj9kb,Thought life is good was really meh when I first heard and then it got better with every listen until I had a day where I was just playing it on repeat lol
41,2020-01-23 01:22:33,esj9kb,"    Eminem - 313K
    Halsey - 196k
    Mac - 187k"
42,2020-01-23 00:39:42,esj9kb,[deleted]
43,2020-01-23 20:57:34,esj9kb,Em won’t touch 300k I don’t think
44,2020-01-23 00:09:32,esj9kb,100 entries in the top 40... stats wise no one can beat drake
45,2020-01-23 07:38:57,esj9kb,If Yummy is indicative of the album then... lol
46,2020-01-23 08:08:09,esj9kb,"Lol if the single is anything like Yummy or if he does another post telling people how to exploit the streaming rules, we will push The Box again or whatever hiphop song that is popping off. I like Biebs but Yummy wasn't it, man.

I have a feeling that Life Is Good will stick around in the top 5/10 for a while"
47,2020-01-23 00:57:04,esj9kb,"They deserve it, one of the best pop rap songs of the last few years"
48,2020-01-22 23:20:28,esj9kb,Simon Faulk (chart prediction guy on Twitter) had the box beating life is good by about 80 points so it wasn’t that close
49,2020-01-22 23:38:32,esj9kb,https://twitter.com/simmnfierzig/status/1218976611145519105
50,2020-01-23 02:33:23,esj9kb,The Box had 77ish million streams and Life is good had 55ish I think. Life is good also had a considerable amount of physical sales but it wasn’t really that close.
51,2020-01-23 02:14:49,esj9kb,[deleted]
52,2020-01-23 01:17:14,esj9kb,"I think Sum 2 Prove is one of catchiest songs he's ever dropped. It isn't my favorite, but I think it's a great choice for a single. It gets stuck in my head like few other songs have the ability to."
53,2020-01-23 08:21:42,esj9kb,Woah is solid but Sum 2 Prove is a lot better imo. Got me hyped af for his tape
54,2020-01-23 03:48:11,esj9kb,Honestly bruh I don’t know how people listen to that shit
55,2020-01-23 16:23:00,esj9kb,This so much. But I see boomers like it more than young ppl
56,2020-01-23 08:17:27,esj9kb,"The song catchy as hell. I cant wait for his next project.

 I went to a concert of his before Do Re Mi got huge, like maybe a few weeks after it released(his ticket was like $13), & it was nothing but girls, none over 25 it seemed. I felt so out of place, but he was a great performer & I love all his songs."
57,2020-01-23 02:31:34,esj9kb,I’m ootl?
58,2020-01-23 00:07:22,esj9kb,"Box is still at 1 and has been for 2 weeks running. Selena has the number 1 album at this point, but it will probably fall off hard next week and Eminem will take the 1 spot"
59,2020-01-23 01:52:08,esj9kb,"Well saying you had the number 2 album in the county doesn't sound as nice.

That's pretty much it"
60,2020-01-23 01:04:05,esj9kb,More promotion is the benefit. Gets people talking and therefore listening.
61,2020-01-23 01:54:02,esj9kb,It can help them renegotiate a better deal with their (or another) label when they resign their contract
62,2020-01-23 15:30:48,esj9kb,Many artists have clauses in their contracts that reward them for number 1s. It helps with contract renegotiations especially. Hence Nicki throwing a fit for not getting number 1
63,2020-01-23 19:48:22,esj9kb,"helps a lot with legacy too. In 50 years when their music will be outdated, people will still look up to the songs that were number 1"
64,2020-01-23 14:10:19,esj9kb,Nah blinding lights is rising and it’s doing amazing internationally
65,2020-01-23 13:59:17,esj9kb,Dont h8 bro he's goin #1 all over Europe
66,2020-01-23 15:07:19,esj9kb,"He still seems like a guy who's one hit away at any given time...hoping it's not something similar to Chance where he fails to keep the momentum going and milked Starboy too much like Chance did with Coloring Book.

The thing in Weeknd's favor is he's also just one feature or hook away from being all over the radio again, especially if/when he ever reunites with Drake."
67,2020-01-23 00:16:52,esj9kb,next week
68,2020-01-23 00:20:26,esj9kb,next week
69,2020-01-23 05:30:33,esj9kb,[deleted]
70,2020-01-23 01:07:33,esj9kb," *The Box* is huge, yea... But he wasn't a nobody before that track. 

He already had 3 Grammy nominations, plus *Die Young*, *Racks in the Middle*, and *Ballin'* were all incredibly popular before *The Box* released.

Sure, *The Box* helped propel him to superstar status, but he was already doing very well, and his talent is what got him there."
71,2020-01-23 01:32:20,esj9kb,The box was going number 1 before the streaming push on social. And it was number 3 before then. Also his second and third weeks he sold 70k.
72,2020-01-23 14:59:59,esj9kb,Drake does that everytime and yet you don't bat an eye. Selena was way less offensive than Justin was.
73,2020-01-23 01:44:48,esj9kb,"It's true, he cared more about the craft, but can you imagine focusing more on the craft and still being able to top the charts?"
74,2020-01-23 01:52:32,esj9kb,"It peaked at 18

Also Future is definitely not slept on lol"
75,2020-01-23 01:56:54,esj9kb,cause streaming wasn't as big
76,2020-01-23 02:23:02,esj9kb,It was only released on SoundCloud at first. They only only started pushing it for real because of how popping it was but by the time it was released officially it’s popularity subsided.
77,2020-01-23 01:11:08,esj9kb,[deleted]
78,2020-01-23 00:35:09,esj9kb,"Facts, I was so confused when I saw that song got a video. It’s not a bad song but idk how the video for that came out before both The Box and High Fashion. Obviously if he likes it he likes it but I really wish he picked High Fashion instead"
79,2020-01-23 01:20:09,esj9kb,"Mac will be in 3rd with 175-200k. 

Eminem will be 1st with 300k or so.

Halsey will be 2nd with 200k or so."
80,2020-01-23 01:58:06,esj9kb,"Mac has been predicted way higher than that, probably closer to 150"
81,2020-01-23 01:01:01,esj9kb,The absolute disrespect to the Glee Cast
82,2020-01-23 08:49:35,esj9kb,Big part of that is the way the top 100 is determined now with streaming. Anyone pre 2010 didn't have an opportunity to have their whole album debit in the top 40 because they weren't released as singles but now with streaming that doesn't matter
83,2020-01-23 15:07:28,esj9kb,The previews he had on the YouTube announcement were much better than Yummy. Idek why would they pick that hot shit for the lead single.
84,2020-01-23 08:14:00,esj9kb,Very reminiscent of 90s boyband pop
85,2020-01-23 03:23:36,esj9kb,I mean it sort of is just a drake song attached to a future song
86,2020-01-23 09:55:23,esj9kb,"No shit fam I live in Australia and it's like the second national anthem. Song's gonna be number one on the Annual Triple J Hot 100 this weekend, smfh."
87,2020-01-23 19:46:57,esj9kb,"I saw him couple years back opening up for hoodie allen. Actually come to think about it, KYLE was also opening for hoodie back then lmao"
88,2020-01-23 04:38:48,esj9kb,"Bitch was begging fans to stream her shit album saying how much a number 1 album would mean to her and how its ""rare"". I mean begging hard AF. She also went to all her local Walmart's, targets and shit to buy every single copy of her album lmaooo.

It's a shame it worked."
89,2020-01-23 01:14:07,esj9kb,Thank you! Also are Mac’s and Em’s albums sales will come out on Friday right?
90,2020-01-23 15:29:45,esj9kb,This exactly
91,2020-01-23 17:24:05,esj9kb,"Lol what? You act Starboy is his only other successful album. Beauty Behind the Madness was huge when it dropped and Trilogy is still his best album to date imo, while others would argue for Kissland. Only album that didn't do as well as the others was MDM and that was more of a personal album, he didn't even bother marketing or promoting it much."
92,2020-01-23 16:00:47,esj9kb,"Heartless is all over the radio... its top 10 there right now

And I hope you really didn’t compare The Weeknd to Chance"
93,2020-01-23 05:56:31,esj9kb,Why are you downvoting me for asking a question? I’m not an Eminem stan but the album did 300k in sales so it will obviously be on the list. Jeez I was just curious 😳
94,2020-01-23 01:31:48,esj9kb,"35k like I said is no mean feat especially for a freshman, no denying he's blown up over the last year"
95,2020-01-23 02:24:17,esj9kb,But Justin Bieber somehow made the song go more viral by constantly promoting his own
96,2020-01-23 02:32:27,esj9kb,"The number 1 was cemented once it was clear he was up against yummy and the ""stream the box"" movement started, that seems to be what's pushing the sales back into the 100s. Before it was in the 70s and The Box was in 3rd because of tiktok"
97,2020-01-23 02:24:49,esj9kb,Like Kanye West?
98,2020-01-23 01:57:11,esj9kb,For how long Future has been around only 3 top 10s? That’s definitely slept on. Especially considering how many hits he has writing credits for.
99,2020-01-23 08:39:25,esj9kb,the video has more than half a billion views
100,2020-01-23 01:14:23,esj9kb,It's honestly one of the only Uzi songs I haven't liked. I thought it might grow on me but it hasn't.
101,2020-01-23 01:44:50,esj9kb,Video was probably made a while ago
102,2020-01-23 01:33:35,esj9kb,I like Boom Boom Room a lot better than High Fashion but yea he probably should’ve dropped a video for that.
103,2020-01-23 02:11:02,esj9kb,"Lol boom boom room way more likely to be a hit...actually rofl. Like both are great songs but in terms of a hit, high fashion not going off like that"
104,2020-01-23 09:15:38,esj9kb,I can't believe they had that many entries into the hot 100. I never realized it was that big.
105,2020-01-23 11:09:43,esj9kb,[deleted]
106,2020-01-23 08:45:59,esj9kb,Didn't Bieber pull this shit too for his Yummy track
107,2020-01-23 05:10:08,esj9kb,Damn she got number 1?
108,2020-01-23 03:15:56,esj9kb,"They should but I'm not 100% sure, I usually just get sales numbers from the guy that posts them here, whenever that may be"
109,2020-01-25 04:56:11,esj9kb,"*MDM* isn’t even an album, just an EP. I don’t think he even did much promo for it.  And the Call Out My Name video still has half a billion views anyway."
110,2020-01-23 17:58:05,esj9kb,And COMN was still top ten
111,2020-01-23 02:45:39,esj9kb,While you are right. The box was gonna go atleast number 2 without the “stream the box movement” and its streams were increasing day by day. Also while Tik Tok did help it become more popular. It’s not what mad it popular. Idk why you’re trying to discredit the song.
112,2020-01-23 05:18:12,esj9kb,"If JIK is what ""focusing more on the craft"" sounds like, I never want to hear someone focus on the craft again."
113,2020-01-23 02:48:44,esj9kb,he stopped topping the charts when he stopped playing the game after Graduation
114,2020-01-23 01:35:09,esj9kb,It grew on me but yea it’s not that good. If Sanguine didn’t leak and had the push Futsal did. Man that would’ve been a hit.
115,2020-01-23 02:16:03,esj9kb,🤣🤣 High Fashion the second biggest song on the album. You know it’s like #27 on billboard right?
116,2020-01-23 18:31:57,esj9kb,"the first season of glee was fucking great too, they really nailed down how to parody dumb high school drama shows and movies, then that huge writer strike that ruined a bunch of shows(including heroes) happened and after that it just turned into what it was a parody of. by the time all the og cast was out of high school and they kept the show going, it was a fucking trainwreck, i think it was s3 or s4, plus that one guy dying didnt help either. that show could've been great but it turned into some of the worst television i've ever watched, and i finished true blood. 

i had an ex who was way too into glee, so i spent a ridiculous amount of time watching it."
117,2020-01-23 19:44:59,esj9kb,if it was Drake X Future it would have been #1 but they had to do Future ft. Drake smh
118,2020-01-23 20:55:34,esj9kb,It was more so his team rather than Bieber himself
119,2020-01-23 07:02:23,esj9kb,Beat Roddy by 2K
120,2020-01-23 03:33:34,esj9kb,For sure appreciate it my man!
121,2020-01-23 18:17:14,esj9kb,i dont think tik tok made it popular so much as any catchy rap song that comes out these days is gonna be inevitably big on tik tok
122,2020-01-23 12:57:21,esj9kb,Feels like most Kanye Albums are focusing on the craft.
123,2020-01-23 03:13:20,esj9kb,He has 10 number 1 albums in a row
124,2020-01-23 02:51:04,esj9kb,Sanguine was so good. That was absolutely my summer anthem.
125,2020-01-23 22:56:14,esj9kb,Pretty sure he himself tweeted / put on his story to push it
126,2020-01-24 01:23:21,esj9kb,Supposedly he's updating JIK like he did TLOP
127,2020-01-23 04:05:22,esj9kb,his last #1 single was Stronger which was 13 years ago at this point
128,2020-01-23 05:34:46,esj9kb,"Yes, but that's because of his dedicated fan base. He hasn't had a hit song in what feels like at least a decade."
129,2020-01-23 04:05:42,esj9kb,but yeah I see yr point

131,2020-01-23 06:01:44,esj9kb,I Love It with Pumpernickel
132,2020-01-23 20:42:06,esj9kb,yeah heartless peaked at 3 and love lockdown at 2 so they were definitely both huge. power and all of the lights peaked at 22 and 18 respectively which I’ve always kinda been confused about but I was like 9 at the time so I didn’t really pay attention to charts. how ubiquitous were they ?
133,2020-01-23 06:38:20,esj9kb,By hit i think he means a #1 song
134,2020-01-23 20:44:24,esj9kb,"My guess would be the state of Kanye’s reputation at the time that MBDTF was released, he was essentially the butt of every joke"
135,2020-01-23 07:43:51,esj9kb,"I meant like a certified big hit. 

I love it would be the closest he had, but we were talking about Kanye albums and how he changed his formula, that single was on Pump's album. It wasn't even on a Kanye album, which sort of proves the point even more.

He could have easily tacked it onto his album, like most other artists would have done, but he didn't do that."
136,2020-01-25 04:32:08,esj9kb,Going #1 isn’t the definition of a hit. Top 40 in general can be described as hits.
137,2020-01-23 20:59:53,esj9kb,ohhh shit was MBDTF right after the VMA thing
138,2020-01-24 01:24:02,esj9kb,Was still the abomination of Obama's nation at release time
139,2020-01-23 08:58:39,esj9kb,It was meant to be on Yandhi not lil pump's album and imagine if he tacked it onto JIK
140,2020-01-23 21:43:06,esj9kb,"Yeah, if you’re interested listen to season 2 of the podcast *Dissect*. He breaks down MBDTF and also comments on Kanye as a whole and the state of his public persona at the time, it’s absolutely fantastic work"
141,2020-01-23 13:01:45,esj9kb,"He wouldn't have added it to yandhi I  don't think, It sounded nothing like anything on yandhi

What would he have changed the lyrics to for JIK

😂."

145,2020-01-23 13:27:14,esj9kb,"Lol. All that means is at one time he thought about putting it on an album he was working on. 

Kanye changes official tracklists, and unofficial ones more than he changes underwear. He never announced that as the tracklist, so it was an idea at best. 

For all we know yandhi may not have had any of those tracks

Hes known to remake entire albums last minute."
146,2020-01-23 13:30:23,esj9kb,"Seeing as he scraped the album and this is the only tracklist out there, we can only assume that it would've been on there seeing as there's no prove that he ever decided to take it off before scraping the entire project.

181,2020-02-28 01:20:23,fajuci,Mix engineer probably didn’t want to pass on the pain of High School Musical onto anyone else and said “fuck it”.
182,2020-02-27 22:39:39,fajuci,"Wouldn’t surprise me, Disney’s philosophy does not seem to give much weight to any fidelity beyond first impressions. Take for example fake HDR on the mandelorian"
183,2020-02-27 22:52:09,fajuci,"I'm sure it's all engineered and mixed up to their standards. It's not like this style of mastering is going to hurt the music in any way. Plus it saves a lot of money, which even the biggest companies in the world will step over their own grandmas to do -- consider how many people in the VFX industry don't even get paid after working on major motion pictures.

Disney music isn't really art. It's a commercial product."
184,2020-02-27 23:49:12,fajuci,"Maybe they served as consultants or engineers? I highly doubt Disney chose a run of the mill mastering service, never mind how much they want to save a buck. 50$ vs 500$ should be totally indifferent to them."

Just a guess."
187,2020-02-28 01:35:23,fajuci,"Disney seems pretty out of touch these days, and not at all interested in producing anything of actual quality. They just want to make a product that sells. Everything they touch seems so watered down in all areas, including sound.

A reboot tv version of HSM on disney+ ? Not surprised at all they went cheap on mastering. Teenage girls listening on pink earbuds don’t give a shit.

I’ve done Disney animation VO/ADR records and they are very mechanical. Very much “get the job done adequately as quickly and efficiently as possible” sessions. And just because they are a huge studio with tons of money doesn’t mean they aren’t cheap. They will absolutely beat you down on rates."
188,2020-02-28 08:08:39,fajuci,Tbh it doesn't sound bad at all
189,2020-02-28 13:57:54,fajuci,A few people in this thread trashing this but the obvious proof that this doesn't matter and is fine is that literally no one even noticed until this post pointed it out haha

194,2020-02-28 07:40:02,fajuci,"Though i get your point, you can get a real good master from someone who has lots of experience and education with a proper studio for starting at about 40 euros. I can't imagine disney seeing this as a big cost given what they make."
195,2020-02-28 03:27:25,fajuci,Run if the mill mastering service doesn't mean it's a bad mastering service. And you have to also consider the time saved using the service. For ten or so tracks for this one soundtrack it all starts to add up.
196,2020-02-28 02:09:04,fajuci,"My experience working for Disney has been similar, turn and burn stuff for their tv channel. Seems like they are a lot more focused on schedules and the bottom line than making sure the quality is high. But I guess who isn’t anymore."

205,2020-02-28 12:41:53,fajuci,"You can always ask for a master and discuss prices before dropping the name disney. Also there's plenty of great engineers that wouldn't bump their normal price because it's good for their resume (this isn't the same as doing it for exposure because they still ask their normal price)

But yes there would be a lot of people asking more indeed. Doesn't mean there's ways around that."
206,2020-02-28 09:10:33,fajuci,"No, it will affect equalization and Dynamics.  There are also some options now to adjust the final sound."
207,2020-02-28 07:36:23,fajuci,I did not understand that video at all. I've noticed that action scenes in TV become dimmer during the action and go back to being brighter once the action has stopped. Is this the sort of thing he is referring to?
208,2020-02-28 13:46:25,fajuci,I’ve done work for Disney Parks (advertising materials) and there’s no way they would ask for a master without telling you who they are first. They do all communication on company emails and you have to become a vendor for them to work with you. A decent amount of paperwork etc.
209,2020-02-29 03:05:43,fajuci,"What’s difficult to understand? Dynamic range is the difference between the brightest whites and the darkest blacks within a work / scene. HDR TV’s have standards (or guidelines) that say they should produce so much dynamic range and peak brightness, and HDR formats are designed to translate that on screen. Mando-delorian is advertised as “HDR” but does not achieve any of the things hdr is designed to do. It’s using less than half of the dynamic range even the weakest HDR standards specify."
210,2020-02-28 13:54:40,fajuci,"Did you charge them the ""disney price""? Just out of curiosity"
211,2020-02-28 18:42:02,fajuci,"I charged them a bit more than I would charge a usual client but they also ask more. Deliverables include several different cut downs plus they want tighter turnaround times than a typical band would. They also retain all the IP etc so they will be paying to buy that out if you’re composing anything for them, at least in this use case (radio adverts)."
212,2020-02-28 18:47:20,fajuci,I can imagine the price being higher if they ask for more they should pay for more. Though a master and a composed piece are 2 different things. I mean this in a way that there's not a whole lot of extra wishes you can add to a master compared to a composed piece. It's damn sick that u composed for disney though.

Don't get too attached to what any one dream or series of dreams show you. Dreams can be a way of working things out - in other words, making your mind up. Knowing what you want and enjoy helps you form an intent or a ""fun to think about, not so much to do"", so you have your own private playground. ☺️

316,2020-09-01 15:55:18,ikfnvk,People born in 2002 are definitely not millennials. I definitely don't feel millennial in any way. We're very firmly Gen Z.
317,2020-09-01 07:57:20,ikfnvk,"By the way, all of these celebrities I listed were from Famous Birthdays.

[https://www.famousbirthdays.com/](https://www.famousbirthdays.com/)"
318,2020-09-01 07:56:55,ikfnvk,"If 19 years:

Baby Boomers 1941-1959 (first to enter school after WWII ended to last being born in a United States with less than 50 states)

Gen X 1960-1978: First to be born in a United States like today to last graduating college in the 20th century

Millennials: 1979-1997: First to graduate college in the 21st century and the last to spend four years of college on campus

Gen Z: 1998-2016: First to graduate college remotely and the last to be born before Trump was president

Gen Alpha: 2017-present

If 18 years:

Baby Boomer: 1948-1965: The first to not have memories of more than half of the 1900s years and the last to graduate high school before Star Wars

Gen X: 1966-1983: First to enter high school after Star Wars and last to graduate high school before 9/11

Millennials: 1984-2001: First to graduate high school after 9/11 and the last to experience a traditional high school graduation

Gen Z: 2002-2019: First to graduate high school remotely and last to be born before a worldwide pandemic"
319,2020-09-10 21:04:24,ikfnvk,Why did you mention Charli on reddit?
320,2020-09-30 04:15:39,ikfnvk,19 yrolds
321,2020-09-01 07:21:52,ikfnvk,"If I were to group generations by 18 years it would go like this

Boomer: 1942-1960 (ends at 1960 since they're the last that could possibly remember JFK dying)

Gen X: 1961-1979 (first who can't possibly remember JFK dying to last 70s borns)

Gen Y: 1980-1998 (first 80s borns to last who can possibly remember 9/11)

Gen Z: 1999-2017 (first who can't possibly remember 9/11 to last who can possibly remember pre-COVID 19 world)"
322,2020-09-01 17:28:39,ikfnvk,"True. Even though I wouldn't argue for this organization of generations, I still liked reading one possible interpretation of how certain years could be grouped together."
323,2020-09-02 00:03:49,ikfnvk,"I know that, but I actually like this generational grouping. Makes all generations 18-19 years is very balanced, compared to making it very short as 15-16 or less years or making it very long like 21-22+ years. It makes things easier for everyone else instead of all this confusion. But at the same time, this is all arbitrary. I know that we are not really millennials at the end of the day, especially based on how society views millennials and such, but maybe being a millennial is different to another person. Just my two cents."
324,2020-09-01 07:59:34,ikfnvk,Interesting.
325,2020-09-10 23:10:09,ikfnvk,What's wrong with that? I was just listing a bunch of celebrities born around that time.
326,2020-09-01 07:43:39,ikfnvk,"I dont think ""first who cant possibly remember"" or ""last who can possibly remember"" something are good markers to mark a generation. I mean it is very likely a three or four year old would not remember the political importance of these events. They may not even know who this Kennedy is until like years after he died. 1961 might have memories prior to Kennedy's death.  I am sure many 1959 and 1960 borns would not remember Kennedy's death. Many 1995-1998 dont even remember 9/11. 2015-2017 though can end up remembering a world before coronavirus 15 years from now, even though they may not know what coronavirus is.

327,2020-09-01 07:52:21,ikfnvk,"Not bad. It's just shifted over four years earlier.

Instead of this:
Boomer: 1946-1964
Gen X: 1965-1983
Gen Y: 1984-2002
Gen Z: 2003-2021

It's this:
Boomer: 1942-1960
Gen X: 1961-1979
Gen Y: 1980-1998
Gen Z: 1999-2017"
328,2020-09-01 07:58:57,ikfnvk,"The 1961-1979 and 1980-1998 definitions aren't that uncommon actually. Many people want to begin gen y at 1980 since it's the first 80s year, so whenever they also apply the 18 year span, it ends up being 1980-1998. You barely ever see 1942-1960 and 1999-2017 though."
329,2020-09-01 08:09:10,ikfnvk,"I prefer the ranges next to: instead of this rather than its this. Makes no sense for 1960 to be gatekept from the other two early 60s years. You even said 1980 should be start of millennials since it is the first 80s year. First half of the 60s is gen jones anyways. 

I have seen 1945-1959 as a baby boomer definition. 

Then 1960-1979. 

1980-1999 is one of the most agreeable millennial definitions I have come across. It is my favorite actually. 

I am not keen on when Gen Z ends though.

 [https://www.blissevolution.com/hustle-millennials/](https://www.blissevolution.com/hustle-millennials/)"
330,2020-09-01 08:02:57,ikfnvk,"1961-1979 is uncommon. I have seen 1960-1979 though with 1946-1959, and even 1960-1980. 1961-1982 is used by just one source though and that uses 1943-1960. I have seen 1998-2016. Never 1999-2017 though. People would prefer stating X in 1960 if 1964 or 1965 is too late, since the first three years of the 60s are the full early 60s years, just like how you said 1980 should be y as it is the first 80s year. People prefer 1982 over 1980 as the millennial start date though."
331,2020-09-01 08:01:55,ikfnvk,"First of all, I have never seen 1961-1979 and I seen 1942-1960, with the exception of 1942, so 1943-1960. I have seen 1980-1998 (though I feel that most start Y in 1980 cause it is the first 80s year like ending it in 1994 or 1999 for the same numerical reason. I have seen 1999-2017 in a way, maybe excluding 2017, so 1999-2016."
332,2020-09-01 08:13:16,ikfnvk,"Here's a 1961-1979 one from 2008

[https://careerhub.adelaide.edu.au/students/news/detail/114/generations-at-work](https://careerhub.adelaide.edu.au/students/news/detail/114/generations-at-work)

Here's one from last year

[https://globalmedia-it.com/USA/millennials-are-not-the-black-sheep-of-generations/](https://globalmedia-it.com/USA/millennials-are-not-the-black-sheep-of-generations/)

It's a definition that will probably never die off, since it begins at 1961 (the second most popular starting point for gen x) and goes all the way to the end of the 70s."

338,2020-10-29 21:00:25,jk5uvx,Honestly I've lost almost any faith I'll ever get to see this movie....I remember checking the imdb page for cast updates 10 years ago.
339,2020-10-29 15:13:53,jk5uvx,I agree with half of these
340,2020-10-29 11:57:40,jk5uvx,I haven't thought it through too much but I think Hanna Corneau should reprise Elphaba for the movie. And I want Ryan Redmond as Glinda because of [this](https://youtu.be/XRGZtxBfX10).
341,2020-10-30 04:22:50,jk5uvx,OHHH Keala Settle as Madame Morrible would be fantastic. (I just want to see her in everything tbh) and I would LOVE to see Emmy as Elphaba. Her Defying Gravity is just... perfect :')
342,2020-10-29 19:20:02,jk5uvx,I'd like to see Barrett Wilbert Weed as Elphaba
343,2020-11-03 15:07:19,jk5uvx,"McKenzie Kurtz or Dove Cameron!!! NOT beanie, I’m not sure she has the vocal range

Daisy Ridley would be an amazing actress for elphaba or nessarose, and is a great singer! Check out her solos on at the ballet with Barbra Streisand."
344,2020-10-30 04:26:57,jk5uvx,I think Keala Settle should be in every movie musical from now on.

347,2020-10-18 06:23:52,jdaku0,Interesting. I feel like the only issue with the Presidential theory is that the cohorts won't always be consistent in length due to the shorter terms of some presidents (e.g. John F. Kennedy or Gerald Ford).
348,2020-10-19 23:01:54,jdaku0,Great list!  The only thing I can really point out is that Britney Spears is missing from the 1981 list.  She is definitely a Millennial icon.
349,2020-10-18 05:33:37,jdaku0,Good ranges btw
350,2020-10-18 13:29:47,jdaku0,Yeah true.
351,2021-01-10 01:18:53,jdaku0,I think it was about actors/actresses and not musicians so that's why Britney Spears wasn't on there.

353,2021-01-10 01:50:13,jdaku0,"Justin Timberlake is on the list.  While he has some acting credits under his belt, I’d say he’s better known as a musician than an actor."
354,2021-01-10 01:54:08,jdaku0,"He's both but yeah, he's more known as a musician. Maybe it's because he was in a lot of movies in the late 2000s/early 2010s so that's why he was put on the list, I guess."
355,2021-01-10 03:26:40,jdaku0,"I think Britney has done some acting as well.  Wasn’t she part of the Mickey Mouse Club before she became a pop singer?  And she’s done a few acting gigs since her entry to pop stardom as well, but yeah her filmography is very limited, so she’s not well known for acting."
356,2021-01-10 03:31:13,jdaku0,"I guess but in the Mickey Mouse Club, weren't they still singing and dancing? And I think she was in All That but as a pop star, not an actress. She probably has done a few acting gigs but not many people know her other than as a musician. It's like saying that Beyonce was an actress (which is actually more believable as she was in a few legit acting gigs). Ironically, they are both 39 and born in 1981."
357,2021-01-10 03:33:30,jdaku0,"Granted, Britney isn’t known for her acting.  And I can’t say what she did on the Mickey Mouse Club; my house didn’t have the Disney channel though back then I wished it did (I still love Disney and Disney+ is one of my favorite steaming apps)."
358,2021-01-10 03:43:06,jdaku0,"Yeah, I like Disney+. I think it's because when Disney Channel was in its earlier years from 1983-1996, basically the 80s and 90s when you were growing up, it was a premium channel so most families couldn't afford, and it didn't become affordable until 1996ish when you were in high school and the Mickey Mouse Club was over."
359,2021-01-10 03:55:07,jdaku0,"Yeah it was a premium channel when I was a kid.  We did have Disney Afternoons on a broadcast channel though.  Once in a while Disney Channel would be free for a weekend and my
Mom would record movies and shows for my siblings and me.  The only problem was during these free weekends the shows and movies would have the 1-800 subscription number scrolling across the bottom of the screen.  By the time Disney became part of the regular cable lineup I had outgrown their programming, although I would have still watched all the Disney shows from my youth for old times’ sake, but Disney wasn’t showing any of those programs - just the new stuff I was too old for."
360,2021-01-10 04:05:45,jdaku0,"Yeah, that's true. By the time they were finally free, they brought a lot of new things like DCOMs and shows that were popular during the early-mid 90's probably ceased production, like the Mickey Mouse Club."
361,2021-01-10 04:12:00,jdaku0,"One thing I do like about Disney+ (besides the Star Wars content) is that I can go back and watch all the Disney shows and movies I did grow up with.  Yes, even though I may be too old for them at my age now, I’ll still watch my old shows from time to time.  I don’t watch those programs that came out after my time, but I will watch old episodes of Talespin, Goof Troop, or even Recess which was technically out when I was a teen but I still watched it for a bit.  Granted, most of what I watch is geared for adults but deep down I can still be a kid at heart.  That’s part of why I love having Disney+."
362,2021-01-10 04:18:56,jdaku0,"I loved watching Disney+ during quarantine for most of 2020 but I started getting out of it. I'll try and get back on it tho. I will admit, I was watching Netflix this past week for 17 Again, Easy A, and most importantly Cobra Kai (IMO one of the greatest shows in recent history)."
363,2021-01-10 19:14:56,jdaku0,"I haven’t seen Cobra Kai yet.  I hear it’s really good.  Mainly what I watch is YouTube, though honestly I don’t really watch a lot of tv.  My tv is always on but usually more for background noise than video entertainment.  Still, when I do watch tv it is usually YouTube.  Quarantine didn’t really change my life much.  I’m an essential worker, so I still leave the house for work.  I never was much of a bar fly or club dancer, so staying home rather than going out doesn’t really bother me.  My life is pretty much the same as it was before the pandemic except for wearing masks in public.  As far as staying home, I’m usually engaged in my hobbies or projects that keep me busy.  However, one thing I like about streaming is all the options I have today because though I’m not a big tv watcher, when I do watch tv I like to have options.  I’d say Disney+, YouTube, Pluto TV, and Netflix are the ones I use most, along with Amazon Prime and Hulu.  I bundle Hulu and Disney, and i share Hulu and Netflix with my family members."
364,2021-01-10 20:12:16,jdaku0,"That's interesting. When you do have the free time, please check out that show. Especially if you watched the Karate Kid series from the 80's, it will make a lot more sense and even better to watch."

368,2020-12-11 20:10:34,kava0q,did anyone else notice some icky autotune in practically every song? it wasnt too bad in most songs but it was almost unbearable on Mark St. Cyr's song
369,2020-12-11 15:33:29,kava0q,"This got me so excited. In the sneak peak it showed, Gina was staying (we assume at Ashlyn’s house), it shows Ricky and Nini together, it showed Ashlyn and Big Red together as well.

Before “The perfect gift” Joshua talks about how Ricky couldn’t afford a gift so he wrote a song. This shows that there is some financial crisis probably something to do the the divorce in the show."
370,2020-12-11 19:23:14,kava0q,"I love the series and all of the cast and it’s fun to see the actors enjoying music and being silly (“Little St. Nick” is a goofy joy!). I do really like the “fantasy” of the show and the characters so looking forward to seeing more of the series with the great characters, heartwarming story arcs, great editing and production values. Can’t wait for the series to come back."
371,2020-12-11 19:31:18,kava0q,Ok the duet with Kate Reinders and Mark St. Cyr is too cute!
372,2020-12-12 02:30:32,kava0q,Dara is such a star I can’t wait to see more of her! ⭐️
373,2020-12-12 09:21:08,kava0q,I find it hilarious Joe was singing in Spanish and Frankie wasn't
374,2020-12-13 05:39:07,kava0q,"“Something in the Air” got me SO excited for Season 2! Obviously it was great to see the cast again and hear them singing and talking about themselves throughout the special, but it was really awesome to see these characters again!

I really like the song, and all of the singing and dancing was amazing! It was also awesome to see so much h of the school showcased. I especially loved the library but maybe that’s because it featured Ashlyn and Big Red (in an adorable Hanukkah sweater)! 

Very happy that Gina’s obviously stuck around this long! I can’t wait to see her and Ashlyn together more; I think that could be a really nice sub-plot and relationship. It’s also great to see that the theater is going to get repaired over the break. I just hope nothing happens to Miss Jenn and Mr. Mazzara!"
375,2020-12-14 08:26:43,kava0q,This was fun 45 minutes! Josh’s song killed it tho!
376,2020-12-13 00:53:30,kava0q,"For some reason I was expecting a few episodes of the series in a sort of Holiday Special, what we got was some interviews with the actors talking about christmas. Lmao, what a load of nothing was that. I've never heard more cliché sentences about christmas like in this special."
377,2020-12-12 02:25:01,kava0q,"I also thought it was really obvious and unnecessary on Frankie and Joe’s song. We’ve heard Joe Serefani sing before and his voice doesn’t need it. I guess they were trying to give the songs a more pop vibe, but I’m glad I’m not the only one who thought there was bad autotune."
378,2020-12-15 21:24:20,kava0q,"Yes, I did notice a particular autotune/studio quality to all of the songs. I think it's quite obvious that the actors are lip-synching to pre-recorded studio tracks, rather than the live singing they did in the 1st season. That being said, I haven't compared the soundtrack to the special the way I have for the 1st season so let's see."
379,2020-12-18 04:55:27,kava0q,Dude yesss I’ve been waiting for somebody else to notice this... it’s so obvious and unnecessary :/
380,2020-12-20 00:07:35,kava0q,"This is so true! I couldn’t really tell until I watched the live performances, like Dara is seriously amazing on the Tamron Hall show, and that version is so much better than the auto-tuned one."
381,2020-12-14 08:42:44,kava0q,We also got a scene at the end and the first new song for the new season. But idk if you made it that far haha
382,2020-12-12 02:38:47,kava0q,"I wish they didn’t auto tune so much, they all can sing so well naturally"
383,2020-12-14 09:33:11,kava0q,"I did, but didn't think it was such a big thing."

388,2020-11-20 06:44:41,jxk7fp,"Definitely some bangers on here! I really loved “River”, “Last Christmas”, and “Something in the Air” in particular. There were some very... interesting things going on with some of the other tracks in terms of the orchestrations and vocal effects but I still think everyone did a really good job. My least favorite was probably “Feliz Navidad”. 😬 Can’t wait to see how “Something in the Air” fits into the context of the show ."
389,2020-11-20 07:02:02,jxk7fp,"I loved every song on this album, my top 3 would be River, That's Christmas to Me, and Something in the Air. That's Christmas to Me was so nice especially because of the acapella. Dara really killed it, I love that she had two solos because her voice is so nice to listen to. I can't wait for the holiday special, I think Something in the Air will be a big opening number."
390,2020-11-21 03:41:33,jxk7fp,"Josh and Matt singing together on Little Saint Nick was my favourite part, but there was definitely way too much autotune overall :( I thought it was mostly unnecessary. Especially on Feliz Navidad it was very overbearing"
391,2020-11-20 19:48:06,jxk7fp,"I really liked the songs ""little Saint Nick"", ""River"", ""Last Christmas"" and ""White Christmas"". And I am really happy with how they made Matt Cornett ""bigger"" in this album. Meaning how they gave him some more songs to sing and he sounded awesome! I didn't necessarily like ""A Billion Sorrys"" So, I think that they displayed his voice much better in this album! (lol. If the word displayed is the right word? :D)"
392,2020-11-20 22:40:02,jxk7fp,The Hanukkah song was awful...
393,2020-11-24 05:42:41,jxk7fp,They did Joe and Frankie SO dirty on Feliz Navidad and I was so looking forward to their duet. They better get an incredible original in season 2 to make up for this. Hopefully they do all the songs live in the special because all of the autotune was not it. This cast is so talented so it was unnecessary.

395,2020-11-21 20:25:46,jxk7fp,"Yeah, I’m really not sure what was up with all the weird orchestrations and autotune. Feliz Navidad just had too much going on. And I definitely heard some really weird vocal effects and autotune on White Christmas and What Are You Doing Year’s Eve?, which is weird because you can tell that everyone is a great singer."
396,2020-11-21 20:28:02,jxk7fp,"Yeah, I thought Matt sounded great here! I’m a Beach Boys fan so I was a little nervous about “Little Saint Nick,” but I thought they captured the vibes really well and sounded awesome. I really wasn’t expecting it to be but “Last Christmas” was one of my favorites too; I think Matt sounds really nice and even thought I’ve heard the song so many times I thought it was a really good version."
397,2020-11-21 20:23:52,jxk7fp,"Having heard several pretty terrible rock versions of those songs before, I went in with relatively high expectations but I think once you get past the weirdness of turning those songs into a weird kiddy pop song, it’s actually kind of fun, and I love Julia’s voice."

402,2020-11-15 23:24:15,juvazz,"Yeah but as we've established in the past the celebs that influence a generation tend to not be born in the generation they are influencing, or if they are its in the very early part of it. For example.

For example going with all music artists:

Baby Boomer influencing celebs: Mostly born between 1935 - 1944 

Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, Waylon Jennings, Kenny Rogers, Dusty Springfield, John Lennon, Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger, Roger Daltrey

Generation X influencing celebs: Mostly born between 1955 - 1964

Billy Idol, Teena Marie, Sid Vicious, Madonna, Bryan Adams, Bono, Boy George, Jon Bon Jovi, George Michael, Chris Cornell

Millennial influencing celebs: Mostly born between 1975 - 1984

Fergie, Chester Bennington, Chris Martin, Usher, Adam Levine, Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears, Kelly Clarkson, Macklemore, Avril Lavigne

Gen Z influencing celebs: Mostly born between 1995 - 2004

Post Malone, Tekashi69, Lil Yachty, XXXTentacion, Lil Nas X, Lil Pump, Billie Eilish, Jacob Sartorius, MattyB, Grace Vanderwaal."
403,2020-11-15 23:42:43,juvazz,Yes 100%

405,2020-11-15 23:46:54,juvazz,"I forgot to mention that the Soomer transition is about 1936/1937ish-1943ish. Starts with people like John McCain, Pope Francis, Kenneth Copeland, Bill Cosby, and Morgan Freeman (honorary Boomers) and ends with Kurtwood Smith, wrestler Billy Graham, Jimmy Snuka, etc."
406,2020-11-15 23:35:32,juvazz,I know! That's why I said a generation system based on ONLY celebrities. Doesn't mean that half of these people are in the generation they are influencing but that's the way it is in a way.
407,2020-11-15 23:48:11,juvazz,"Yeah definitely. You are solid Gen X. The catch here is that this whole list is shifted to resemble the celebrities that represent each generation, not the actual birth years of those people."
408,2020-11-16 00:34:30,juvazz,John McCain doesn't seem part Boomer at all or Bill Cosby or Pope Francis. None of the list does. A better example would be Janis Joplin or John Lennon.
409,2020-11-16 00:02:48,juvazz,Ok that makes more sense.
410,2020-11-16 00:43:35,juvazz,"I can see John McCain and Pope Francis not being remotely Boomer but Bill Cosby is definitely Boomerish, no question."
