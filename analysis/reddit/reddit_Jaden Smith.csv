48,2020-01-28 20:58:20,evamw6,I'm trying to have a conversation with you. How is my position ignorant?
49,2020-01-28 21:03:48,evamw6,"You can't blame evil deeds perpetrated by evil people on the religion they abuse in order to do so.  I have known many people who have reaped great benefit from what religion provides them,and you can't ignore the advances humanity has made, medically, technologically, artistically, etc., all thanks to religion.  For example, while the Catholic church is as evil and organization as Planned Parenthood (joke), they are also responsible for some of the most beautiful paintings and sculptures ever seen."
50,2020-01-28 21:23:07,evamw6,"Ironically I am a huge fan of Roman Catholic architecture. 

But to the issue, I can blame religion for the evils by evil religious people. Especially when people in power have used religion to control and manipulate the masses for thousands of years. 

As far as advancements in science etc, I would argue that we would be FAR more advanced without religion trying to tell us that every new technology is the devil. Consider Galileo's persecution for stating the earth revolved around the sun and being declared a heretic. This is one small example of many of the church taking the word of a book that they think is the word of god rather than measurable sciences. We STILL have this problem today, as many of those in power still seek guidance from this book. 

It's frightening."
51,2020-01-28 21:27:40,evamw6,"Again, you are blaming the tool rather than the person.  Religion in and of itself is neither malevolent nor benevolent; it is what the user makes of it.

What I find amusing is atheists today are as fervent and closedminded in their belief as the most astute adherent to christianity, islam,or any other religion."
52,2020-01-28 21:40:05,evamw6,It‚Äôs not frightening your taking an example that is almost 400 years old and equating it to today.  People have advanced exponentially technological in the past 12 years then the entire existence of mankind combined.  India still doesn‚Äôt understand plumbing though
53,2020-01-28 21:41:03,evamw6,Ok do just let this tool to continue to be used against the general public then? Gotcha.
54,2020-01-28 21:42:50,evamw6,I'm equating it today because people in power are still using fairly tales to government the masses. Should they be? No.
55,2020-01-28 21:44:20,evamw6,As opposed to what?  What's your solution?  Complete eradication of all religion?  That is selfish and unrealistic.

91,2020-01-27 17:00:11,euitt0,"[](/olemiss) **Ole Miss** [](/olemiss) 

*Potential Defense* 

Position | Name | Classification | Backup | Classification
---|---|---|---|---|
Catcher | Hayden Dunhurst | Freshman | Knox Loposer | Sophomore 
1st Base | Cael Baker | Junior | Kevin Graham | Sophomore 
2nd Base | Peyton Chatagnier | Freshman | Connor Walsh | Freshman 
Shortstop | Anthony Servideo | Junior | Peyton Chatagnier | Freshman 
3rd Base | Tyler Keenan | Junior | Cael Baker | Junior 
Left Field | Hayden Leatherwood | Junior | Tim Elko | Junior
Center Field | Jerrion Ealy | Freshman | John Rhys Plumlee | Freshman 
Right Field | Justin Bench | Sophomore | Trey Lafleur | Freshman 
Designated Hitter | Kevin Graham | Sophomore | Tim Elko | Junior 

*Notes* 

This is just my guess based on watching the team scrimmage about four times in the fall and spring. Baker looks pretty natural at 3rd base despite being a 1st baseman by trade. Keenan has struggled a bit in the spring scrimmages that I attended, which is concerning as he is most of the returning offense from last season. 

Freshman Peyton Chatagnier has been really impressive in the fall and the spring and I imagine he locks down the starting spot at 2nd base for the year. If Peyton is not ready, then Justin Bench would most likely slide into that spot rather than backup Connor Walsh. 

Freshman Lafleur has shown some power in the spring as well as the ability to play defense well. If the right field spot was vacant, I imagine he sees some time there as well. 

Football stars Jerrion Ealy and John Rhys Plumlee will man the center field it appears, with Ealy holding a strong lead over JRP for the spot. Plumlee has struggled to read balls off of the bat in the spring and has also struggled at the plate. I imagine he sees little playing time outside of pinch running spots. 

Ealy has been impressive both in the field and at the plate. The team's success lies on his shoulders in my opinion. If he can hit well enough to justify his spot in the lineup, then the team looks solid. If he struggles to hit, then the Rebs outfield situation starts to look a little more dire. 

*What to expect* 

This is a young Rebels team that is facing what is probably the hardest schedule in the country this year. The Rebs will face #1 [](/vanderbilt) Vanderbilt, #2 [](/louisville) Louisville, #4 [](/florida) Florida, #5 [](/georgia) Georgia, #7 [](/arkansas) Arkansas, #8 [](/mississippistate) Mississippi State, #10 [](/auburn) Auburn, #13 [](/lsu) LSU, #22 [](/eastcarolina) ECU, and #23 [](/texasam) Texas A&M. 

The offense has to show promise this year or the team is doomed from the start. This is the largest question mark with the 2020 Rebels, is how they will replace the offensive power they had last season. 

*Potential Rotation and Bullpen*

Position | Name | Classification 
---|---|---|
Friday SP | Doug Nikhazy | Sophomore 
Saturday SP | Gunnar Hoglund | Sophomore 
Sunday SP | Derek Diamond | Freshman 
Midweek SP | Tyler Myers | Senior 
RHP | Greer Holston | Senior 
RHP | Taylor Broadway | Senior 
RHP | Max Cioffi | Junior 
RHP | Mitch Murrell | Freshman 
RHP | Drew McDaniel | Freshman 
RHP | Austin Miller | Senior 
RHP | Braden Forsyth | Freshman 

*Notes* 

With a strong front end of the rotation, the Rebs need Diamond to be good on Sundays. Nikhazy comes off a phenomenal freshman campaign, where he worked his way up through the bullpen and into a starting spot on Saturdays last season. Nikhazy looks the same as he did last season so far through the scrimmages. I would not be shocked to see Doug also get some plate appearances early in the season, as he has been hitting a little bit in scrimmages. 

Former 1st round MLB pick Gunnar Hoglund struggled to start the season last year, but near the end of the season came around and offered some meaningful innings. Hoglund struggles in the cold weather, but once the temps pick up so does his speed. I expect Hoglund to start the season throwing around 90-91, but to end the season sitting around 94. If Hoglund can get up into the mid-90s with his fastball and command his offspeed pitch, he should be a perfect Saturday guy. So far in the spring, his offspeed has looked really good while his fastball is sitting around 90 MPH. Expect some inconsistency with Gunnar this year, especially early on. 

Derek Diamond is a highly rated recruit who ended up at Ole Miss over Stanford and others. He has looked really good in scrimmages and fall ball. I expect him to offer some decent outings for the Rebs. With a decent but unproven bullpen, if Diamond can get 4 or 5 innings for the Rebs on Sundays I imagine coaches will be happy with him. 

The bullpen relies on Greer Holston's return to dominance and Taylor Broadway staying steady. Holston suffered from dead arm last season, but has moved past that and has been throwing steadily through practices and scrimmages. The Rebels NEED Holston to pitch well this year. 

With the loss of closer Parker Carracci, that spot is wide open this season. I expect Holston and Austin Miller to get some time in that role and the coaches will go from there. Junior Max Cioffi may also get a few opportunities at the closing spot. 

Braden Forsyth is a name to look for out of the freshmen in the bullpen. I don't know what his role will be, but the new kid has shown some potential in the bullpen this season. 

*What to expect* 

The pitching should be solid this season for the Rebels, but there are some question marks. Can Hoglund find success early in the season? Will Diamond continue to pitch well into the season? Can the inexperienced bullpen perform well enough in the late innings of a game. I expect Nikhazy to continue being the ace that the Rebels need this season, with Hoglund coming on later in the season. I expect Diamond to perform well enough on Sundays to maintain his spot there. I do worry about the bullpen, with the lack of experienced arms, but hope that the Rebs can put it together with some new faces in the pen. 

*Season Expectations*

Personally, with this schedule and roster, I expect the Rebels to throw up a 14-16 or 13-17 in SEC play. While that sounds awful, if the Rebs can not trip up in the out of conference schedule and secure some wins over Louisville and East Carolina, that is probably still good enough for a high 2 seed in the tournament. If the Rebs can go deep in Hoover again, even with a ""bad"" SEC record, the Rebs could find themselves in the conversation for a host spot again. 

I personally do not see the Rebels getting a host spot this season, unless something miraculous happens. Expect a high 2 seed spot for the Rebels come playoff time."
92,2020-01-27 20:54:19,euitt0,"So we have a team. It's all new and we have no clue what to expect lol. I just hope we find an ace early on, have a couple good batters to cheer for, and win 10 games."
93,2020-01-27 20:32:52,euitt0,"Spot on for LSU, sophomores like Bianco and Dugas need to step up at the dish this year.  Infield defense will be suspect also, hopefully not too terrible.  Pitching will be the best staff since Maineri has been here. Gotta stay healthy no more of this ‚Äúarm soreness‚Äù shit and they get shut down all year."

But as you noted, Noland and Wicklander were freshmen last year and are expected to be vastly improved.  Without a true ace, you can still win the SEC, but you need one to win the WS and SECT, because typically teams rely on their aces more at crunch time."

148,2020-01-26 12:48:23,eu58pb,"I respect the effort, but you make a ton of assumptions about our guys having trade value that, in all likelihood, they do not have. 

I think the only semi-realistic trade here is Morris for a first. Everything else is wishful thinking. I mean, in what world do Portis and Payton have enough value to bring us back the 31st overall pick?"
149,2020-01-26 13:35:25,eu58pb,Knicks have lost 12 games by 6 points or less. They are the worst free throw shooting team in the league.  They miss 7.1 free throws per game.  Are they a good team? No.  But I dont feel they are as bad as the record suggests. Keep the guys who want to be here.  Five 1-3 year guys isnt going to win anything. Vets are a part of the process too.
150,2020-01-26 12:32:28,eu58pb,"No secret we should sell any and all of our vets for any young guys and picks. Even if they‚Äôre 2nd rounders. The Darryl Morey thing I don‚Äôt care about, Rockets ain‚Äôt done jack. The best teams are the ones with the best talent. Everyone else bends to them. 

I‚Äôll nitpick at the last part. Free agent values are way skewed. You‚Äôre talking bertans for 15 mill for 1 season. Yea that makes sense, but then plan b is to offer him 14 mill for 4. How does that make any sense at all? 3.5 million per year? Dude has played himself into 10 million bucks easy per season."
151,2020-01-26 14:42:48,eu58pb,"Great work and good presentation but a lot of this is still unrealistic. To summarise, it's to hire quality development staff and move anyone past 22 y.o. then rebuild with youth. This has its own issues. 

//Begin rant
One is that Vets are still required in a team but they need to be quality players who buy into our system, carry the team through the troubles and at the same time mentor the youth.

The Knicks system every year for the last 20 years reminds me of having an assignment to complete, leaving it until the last day and then trying to construct a masterpiece overnight when you never did any research in the first place. Last years result was a good example.

We've ended up with a couple of good vets (Taj,Morris) and a heap of overpaid hacks.
Paying these players disproportionately across the roster(age) would come with its own problems in the team. But the players we gained had nothing to bring the team for the short term (wins) or long term (development). It made more sense to use that cap space to take on bad contracts (possible development vets) and gain assets in the process. Atlanta and Memphis have done this well.

Then if you look at a team like the Spurs who has built a reputation on is having a solid foundation. Knicks haven't had that for decades. Cutting the team to shreds won't solve the problems.

If the Knicks are ever going to move off the bottom of the league it won't be a quick fix. Free agents have no confidence in coming here. The move in hiring Mike Miller was a good start, in hiring a coach who had grown within the organisation. Also players like Dotson should be retained to show we reward players who show development and commit to the team. Same goes for Frank next year.

I agree that we need to continue to trade players to build the team but Knicks issue is bigger than the players. If they are looking to improve the culture then players like DSJ, Portis and Trier who show very little team commitment should be moved. 

Plus we should lose this BS of showcasing players before the trade deadline. All that does is halt development of the players we do need to build and continue down the same slippery slope of constantly trading assets with the hope of hitting a home run trade to solve all our problems.

The draft will help the Knicks a lot but if we have no system, another new coach and an ever-changing roster then we will always be lolknicks. The change needs to start from the brass and then make small changes that can lead to growth whereas right now they are doing the exact opposite.
//End rant"
152,2020-01-26 17:43:46,eu58pb,"Lmao...wth. So we ended up getting 6 picks, signed five of the biggest free agents, and a top 3 pick? Haha okay..."
153,2020-01-26 15:54:52,eu58pb,"Dumping all our salary in unrealistic trades for picks and sign AD and Ingram is Plan A? FVV and Bogdanovic taking incredibly below market 3 year deals is Plan B? 

More words doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not a quick fix. Appreciate the effort but these moves are only realistic in 2K."

155,2020-01-26 17:16:35,eu58pb,"It's not bad in theory, but some the trades are unrealistic. Some of the signings I'm unsure about as well.

I also don't know why you would want to sign Beasley but not give him minutes"
156,2020-01-27 15:28:11,eu58pb,Cool except this is real life not 2K myGM
157,2020-01-26 17:02:46,eu58pb,"I have no idea why there's all this hate. It is well formatted and well thought out:

I see all kinds of crazy trades and ideas all scattered throughout. Instead of bad mouthing, why not give your version of what you would like to see? 

Also, I love people that claim ""2K trades"". I literally came across a 2K trade from a Pistons blog writer in regards to what they could get back for Andre Drummond. I kid you not, Jru Holiday and a 1st was one of the scenarios. The beat writer then went on to say that it would make the Pistons have ""too many guards"" and ""wouldn't make sense for them"". Then there was Middleton and Brook Lopez for Drummond which suddenly ""didnt make sense for the Bucks"". 

This post suggests nothing that insane. 

The Heat wouldn't like Morris? 
I posted a deal that would be a 3 team trade:
Morris and Covington to the Heat
DSJ, Ellington and Portis to the Twolves
Justice Winslow, Duncan Robinson, Dieng and Waiters to the Knicks. 

The Mavs are looking for a 15+ point game, big. Portis can knock down open 3s. Imagine how many he would get on the Mavs? 
Then you have Payton's ability to drive the lane while team's are more focused on guarding the perimeter. 

How many teams are shopping even above average players? The Kings? Nope. Hawks? Nope. Bulls? Not really. Wolves? Apparently not. What players are ""deserving"" of the ""31st overall pick""? Oh and in an apparently weak draft class. Do tell your list. 

The Blazers one is way off. 

Reading is also an issue sometimes. You cop out and say ""2k trade"" but can't read. 

Hes suggesting 1 year/15 mil or 4 years/56 mil. 
Not 3 mil a year, lmao.

But then again, Jason Derulo is kind of a different case as his entire musical campaign was built around becoming a pop culture icon so he knew very well what he was getting into when the production label approached him. He's obviously made his retirement but he also made a lot of money for a lot of other people (who you and I have probably never even heard of).

It's a bit like selling your soul to the devil (maybe, maybe not, but I've always thought of it this way). Sure, you end up rich but at a certain point, as perhaps maybe seen in Derulos case, you become sick of it. It's why the execs dont want to do it themselves, no one wants to sign away their privacy. Its a pretty shitty deal imo but still, there are millions that would love to be in his shoes for a day lol."

Then again there are also some people who fucking love the control! Should clarify I am not saying that of you or that there isn't a broad spectrum in between. Presumably economics is also a primary factor in all of this"
231,2020-01-24 01:19:37,esw6ob,It's not even 100% in western cultures. Depends on the parent and kid really. The point you're expected to move out is consistent in the west but how happy/sad the parents are tends to vary.

430,2020-03-27 04:14:32,fp50of,Our pick goes to the sixers right?
431,2020-03-26 04:18:35,fp50of,"The last terrible draft gave us Giannis, Oladipo, Adams, CJ, Schr√∂der, and Gobert. There‚Äôs bound to be some talented dudes in this one too."

434,2020-03-26 13:28:32,fp4o7a,"I really think the Warriors go Avdija there instead of Okongwu and then the Wolves snap up Okongwu the next pick. Other than that this is a pretty solid mock imo!

People may question Wiseman at 1 but I‚Äôm not sure he‚Äôs any less risky than Ball or Edwards"
435,2020-03-28 12:51:08,fp4o7a,"I feel like Poku is going to end up being the steal of the draft. The biggest knocks about him seems to be his level of competition and his skinny frame. I honestly think his upper body will fill out and his lower body seems a lot less ‚Äúskinny‚Äù.

He‚Äôs a highly skilled player (ball handling/IQ) in a 7 foot frame. He‚Äôs a good rim protector/rebounder, despite his weak upper body. I hope he doesn‚Äôt slip past the Wolves at 16z"
436,2020-03-26 22:13:23,fp4o7a,I feel like we (cavs) would trade down or try to package Edwards with another asset for some young talent that fits better
437,2020-03-26 22:25:14,fp4o7a,"I think the Twolves go with Toppin honestly. I just think that they need guys who come in straight away that are effective. The time is now to prove to KAT that he can win in Minnesota especially now with D'lo there. Maybe Deni is the better long-term player, but right out of the gate I just don't see an argument to say he'll be better than Obi.

Kind of a nit pick but I do like your mock. There's so many different scenarios I can see come draft night considering how close the talent is in this class."
438,2020-03-27 13:45:26,fp4o7a,"Ball at 3 seems like a stretch, but maybe.  The Golden State and Charlotte picks are illogical though.  There is no chance they draft those players.  Pistons would also almost surely take Anthony over Hayes.  They have the worst attendance in the league."
439,2020-03-28 02:55:42,fp4o7a,Don't see the mavs taking nico. See them going 3/D wing
440,2020-03-26 15:05:22,fp4o7a,Yeah and also the Wizards could really use a big
441,2020-03-26 14:12:09,fp4o7a,Yeah Okongwu and Deni could have been flipped. My theory is GSW would want a cost controlled big man for the next few years for their championship window.
442,2020-03-27 23:49:43,fp4o7a,"doubt wolves go Okongwu, doesn't fit with the new FO's MO"
443,2020-03-26 16:28:32,fp4o7a,"Only thing is Okongwu is a complete functional overlap with draymond who closes games at the 5 anyways. Avdija would fill a legitimate need of versatile wings. Also it‚Äôs not really that hard to find cheap bigs, warriors have been doing that for years. There‚Äôs always a Aron Baynes/Richaun Holmes type player out there.


That being said I really do like Okongwu as a prospect and I think he‚Äôd really help balance out Towns/DLo in Minny."
444,2020-03-23 05:24:58,fneg10,"Why would the Hawks ever draft LaMelo

Also Toppin and Jalen Smith are too low, Toppin will go top-10 and Jalen Smith will go top-20"
445,2020-03-23 05:27:27,fneg10,I am a Wizards fan and not high on RJ Hampton. Also curious about what you all think about Deni Avdija going 3.

447,2020-03-23 07:29:17,fneg10,I don‚Äôt think the Hawks would draft a PG
448,2020-03-23 12:09:17,fneg10,"The Kings are going to resign Bogi in the off-season. That leaves a guard rotation of Fox, Bogi, Buddy, and Joseph. They aren't going to draft Maxey. A wing defender in Vassell or a high risk high reward McDaniels would seem to make more sense. I wouldn't be surprised to see them trade down either but Maxey makes very little sense to me"
449,2020-03-23 19:31:42,fneg10,"not a big deal because of the lack of ball recently, but this mock is from the 8th, right? i'd expect a slightly modified one soon."
450,2020-03-23 07:13:56,fneg10,Rather get Bolmaro then Bey but I would live with this
451,2020-03-23 06:54:13,fneg10,"I hope Wiseman ends up at GSW. I know he might not be the top prospect and it's all about BPA and all that jazz but they don't really have anyone else to trade to get a good center, nor do they have cap space. I'd just get Wiseman to plug the hole"
452,2020-03-23 06:37:37,fneg10,Can Obi play the 5?
453,2020-03-23 18:11:48,fneg10,Can people stop taking tankathon seriously? Isn‚Äôt the person that runs it a self-admitted casual? Y‚Äôall shouldn‚Äôt take my mocks drafts too seriously so why take his?

Can Obi play the 5?"
463,2020-03-23 20:49:15,fneg10,"I don‚Äôt see the Warriors drafting Wiseman. His only proven skill is blocking shots. He has no post game and no reliable shot. 

Edwards, on the other hand, is an NBA ready player. He has an NBA body, an explosive move to the hoop, and a sweet jump shot. Based on his size, skills and athleticism, he‚Äôs the best player in the draft and there‚Äôs not a close second.

On the downside, during his one season in Georgia he took too many bad shots and was often indifferent on defense.

If the Warriors can bring the best out of him on a consistent basis, he could be a special player."
464,2020-03-24 02:55:13,fneg10,"There's something called Euro-virus that infects all draft site owners and makes them think that Brooklyn will draft obscure Euro players every time, lol.

465,2020-03-23 05:44:52,fneg10,I mean who should the Hawks take if Deni / Wiseman / Ant are off the board?  Okongwu and hope he can play C?  Maybe they trade the pick but Tankathon isn't accounting for that
466,2020-03-23 11:26:38,fneg10,I hope the hawks ll trade the pick. For other picks or some good player ready to play
467,2020-03-24 00:26:34,fneg10,In this scenario he would clearly be the BPA and LaMelo would be the best asset to trade.
468,2020-03-24 06:53:18,fneg10,Ihu guarantee if the hawks pick lamelo he will hold out what kind of pick is that . Literally the worse type of player to put next trae. Ball dominant guard with a iffy shot and they both don‚Äôt play defense
469,2020-03-23 16:41:23,fneg10,I'd love him in Minnesota tbh
470,2020-03-24 16:55:32,fneg10,Deni has been scouted by us since the season. Strong contention to be the selection.
471,2020-03-23 07:06:05,fneg10,Think people see him as an elite defender who can develop a shot and turn into an x-factor. Offensively he hasn‚Äôt shown anything that indicates that but I understand if teams believe in him expanding his game.
472,2020-03-23 12:52:29,fneg10,"I think teams will look at him in a similar vein to Marcus smart. His percentages aren‚Äôt great from three but he‚Äôs a solid finisher and has shown some confidence taking step back threes. May be a little while, but I think his shooting will come around."
473,2020-03-23 06:45:52,fneg10,Want to hear thoughts on this as well.
474,2020-03-23 07:14:49,fneg10,1-4 elite defender (on and off ball) on defense and slasher on offense in theory
475,2020-03-23 11:24:41,fneg10,In my opinion I see a late career Andre Iguodala as his median outcome
476,2020-03-23 21:53:51,fneg10,80% of Andre Iguodala
477,2020-03-23 09:48:14,fneg10,"The essence of what makes him special is being able to play above the rim as an undersized forward. So to me , Okoro‚Äôs best role is as a playmaking small ball 4 who defends multiple positions."
478,2020-03-24 03:28:24,fneg10,OG 2.0?
479,2020-03-26 03:04:21,fneg10,I read somewhere on twitter from a sports writer that Vlades really been scouting Aleksej Poku≈°evski. IMO he‚Äôd be a really good fit next to Bagley.
480,2020-03-24 20:53:40,fneg10,what changed since the 8th?
481,2020-03-23 22:20:28,fneg10,Yeah take Bolmaro so Saddiq can fall to the Raps please
482,2020-03-23 11:31:43,fneg10,"As a Warriors fan I truly hope this doesn‚Äôt happen. They can get a center for the biannual exception, MLE, or even the minimum who can do at least 75% of what wiseman can do. If they can get a bruising center to complement Chriss/Bender/Looney, I‚Äôd be happy. I think picking a guard or wing would make a lot more sense."
483,2020-03-23 21:38:31,fneg10,"outside of blocking shots, what special ability has Wiseman demonstrated that justifies the No. 1 pick?"
484,2020-03-23 21:55:27,fneg10,Draymond green is our center to close games... we can get any combination of vet min players to fill minutes here and there. Wiseman isn‚Äôt really as great of a fit in terms of asset allocation as it initially seems.
485,2020-03-23 14:41:28,fneg10,The  more I think about it the more I like Toppin to the Warriors. Hes a much  better offensive player than Wiseman and would thrive in their floor spacing. He is a prospect who will be able to play right away and contribute.
486,2020-03-23 20:15:02,fneg10,"> Y‚Äôall shouldn‚Äôt take my mocks drafts too seriously so why take his?

490,2020-03-23 06:45:44,fneg10,Who would trade up though?
491,2020-03-23 07:14:18,fneg10,It's definitely the best pick here for us
492,2020-03-23 11:32:53,fneg10,Give me Okongwu. Toppin isn‚Äôt good enough defensively to play the 5 in my opinion
493,2020-03-24 07:01:39,fneg10,Poku makes sense though and isn't that wierd
494,2020-03-23 07:10:16,fneg10,"Hail fits Trae really well and means they won't be married to Huerter and could move Cam to SF more. 

Okongwu isn't bad either"
495,2020-03-23 06:05:18,fneg10,"Hayes would be a better fit than LaMelo. He looks like he could operate better off ball than LaMelo could at the very least as we all know Trae isn‚Äôt coming off of it anytime soon. Could also do Okoro as we suck ass at defense, and maaaybee OO but that‚Äôs kind of a stretch if they think Collins will be here long term."
496,2020-03-23 06:04:31,fneg10,"Literally anyone else lol

If I were them I‚Äôd take Okongwu, Okoro, Toppin, Hayes, hell even Cole Anthony over LaMelo

Like yeah I get offense is generally more valuable than defense when compared straight up, but Trae and LaMelo would be by far the worst defensive backcourt in NBA history

In a vacuum LaMelo probably has the highest ceiling of all those guys, but I can easily see him being a complete bust, and there‚Äôs no need for the Hawks to take that huge risk, especially on a ball dominant high volume low efficiency shooter who by all accounts plays absolutely zero defense

Really he‚Äôs only projected so high because people think ‚Äúdamn what if Lonzo was a little bit taller and could shoot‚Äù but from what I‚Äôve seen they‚Äôre not all that comparable"
497,2020-03-24 02:29:46,fneg10,"I obviously don‚Äôt agree he‚Äôs best player available.  But best player to trade is interesting.  Because if a team is high on him, like I‚Äôd assume Portland, Detroit and Sacramento are, you could get quite a bit.  The problem is, I imagine there are a lot of teams very low on him, so if those teams don‚Äôt give you what you want, you could be stuck with him.   And if I‚Äôm Atlanta, the last thing I would want is to be stuck with another young player, when they should really be eying the playoffs next year."
498,2020-03-23 13:39:10,fneg10,"Do people really think his defense is that much better than Vassell's, Bey's, or other 3+D guys to the point where it compensates for his shooting? I personally see Okoro ""falling"" and going somewhere in the 20s and some of the guys like Vassell, Bey and Nesmith (if he continues to light it up in workouts) jumping ahead of him. Depends on the team as well though. Maybe somebody has shooting and feels like they just need a lockdown guard with quick feet to specialize on D."
499,2020-03-23 08:24:07,fneg10,I feel like there can only be 1 non-shooter at all times on the floor who contributes by either rim running or playmaking. The Andre Roberson or Tony Allen type seam to be going extinct. Does he have good mechanics? Is there a shot in his future?
500,2020-03-24 22:11:10,fneg10,"there were a few games played before the season was called on the 12th. Euros, i think, were cancelled the same day. not much activity, but i'd still expect some movement coming up."
501,2020-03-23 23:18:12,fneg10,"Don‚Äôt see any way that happens tbh.  Big 3&D wings like Bey are overvalued now, the days of a prospect like Anunoby slipping in the draft are gone .

Honestly I could see teams in the top 12 talking themselves into Bey. He‚Äôs very safe prospect and went to a respected program, that‚Äôs the type of player who will rise up boards this year when there‚Äôs so little info available on the sleeper prospects."
502,2020-03-23 23:03:08,fneg10,Better for both of us
503,2020-03-23 21:47:21,fneg10,"It‚Äôs obviously not a normal draft year so there won‚Äôt be a conventional #1 pick. If Wiseman projects to be a massive rim protector who can run the floor, set screens and hit jumpers (I‚Äôm not talking about creating his own offense, but developing a PnP game like Myles Turner isn‚Äôt out of the question for JW) then he can add great value to any team. Even moreso GSW who have an exceptional amount of spacing and the playmakers to help Wiseman develop."
504,2020-03-23 21:51:58,fneg10,which is probably more reason for them to not want edwards lol
505,2020-03-23 22:48:33,fneg10,"Sexton is a beast. I was more inferring that Cleveland is such a shit franchise that no matter how much young talent they get it really doesn‚Äôt make a difference, they‚Äôll find a way to fuck things up. Would love to see Edwards end up in Phoenix with booker, that would be a dangerous wing duo"
506,2020-03-24 01:26:03,fneg10,Not to mention he can guard 5 positions while giving you 15 boards
507,2020-03-23 16:10:54,fneg10,Knicks or Detroit. Especially if Lamelo is still available. They both need a franchise player so I can see them trading to try and get one.
508,2020-03-23 20:16:44,fneg10,"If the board falls exactly like this, would you be willing to trade up with the Cavs to get Ball or Edwards? How much would you be willing to give up?"
509,2020-03-23 08:19:03,fneg10,"yea 

i like defense"
510,2020-03-23 18:51:32,fneg10,I feel like Toppin is overated. He‚Äôs also 22
511,2020-03-23 06:51:43,fneg10,"I think taking Okoro at 4 is a massive overdraft even in this current class.  Hayes is probably a little better as a fit but I think if you're playing him off ball he's not gonna give you 4th pick value either, at that point you should be looking to trade as they assumedly would with Lamelo.  Ultimately I'd assume ATL would just go BPA and look to make a deal so whether you think Hayes or Melo is the better prospect determines who's going in that slot, I'm personally pretty split between the two.  I think a trade up to get Edwards from Cleveland could be interesting for both teams if the draft plays out exactly like this"
512,2020-03-23 14:26:34,fneg10,"Melo is a lot better than Lonzo in the half-court, and has a lot more moves to break down a defense. Lonzo is also a much better defender and doesn't need the ball in his hands nearly as much as Melo does. They aren't that similar players if we're being honest. 

Really, the people that are comparing him to his brother are just being lazy, like when European bigs who can shoot are automatically compared to Dirk."
513,2020-03-23 13:35:36,fneg10,"Lol. That is not why lamely is projected high. There is a good argument he is the best player in this draft (though I would personally take 1-2 people over him). ATL could reach for Okoro or okongwu...Logically, I could see them trading down 2 spots with the Knicks. But if no trade happens, Lamelo is the best player on the board. Not just higher ceiling, he's a better player right now than any of the other guys. His abilities might not fit which is the most logical argument for ATL passing on him."
514,2020-03-23 13:39:42,fneg10,Maybe mid-low teens considering this draft
515,2020-03-23 21:50:32,fneg10,"He's the kind of high character guy that Garpax will probably pick, maybe they think he's Jimmy Buckets 2.0 on the basis of trying really hard"
516,2020-03-24 22:42:58,fneg10,"It will be interesting to see how this process plays out. Normally, we‚Äôd have some information from the combine and team workouts and evaluations. Those appear to be in jeopardy, so evaluating and projecting the draft might be challenging"
517,2020-03-23 23:23:25,fneg10,"There‚Äôs always a couple players that fall every year for no explainable reason

Plus I don‚Äôt really see any other good 3/4‚Äôs in the late 20‚Äôs that the Raptors could go for so I‚Äôm hoping that‚Äôs the case with Bey üòÖ"
518,2020-03-23 22:16:08,fneg10,"Shot blocking is a commodity in the NBA and not a skill that should determine the No. 1 pick. Everything else about Wiseman is potential. He doesn‚Äôt have any offensive skills yet that will translate to the NBA and he can‚Äôt defend on the perimeter. He bites on pump fakes way too easily. He‚Äôs a project who might develop in time, but it would be a long wait.

I‚Äôd argue that Anthony Edwards is more NBA ready than Wiseman and is a natural scorer. He would be a poor fit for a team that needs a No. 1 scorer, but on the Warriors he‚Äôd be the 4th option behind Curry, Thompson and Wiggins. And as a slasher with a good jump shot, he could boost the bench short term and work his way into the rotation relatively quickly. And he‚Äôll be 19 when the 2020/21 season starts."
519,2020-03-23 22:05:58,fneg10,Yeah it's a rough draft to be a bad team with a young core consisting entirely of guards
520,2020-03-24 17:34:25,fneg10,"Cavs just get picked apart because they have LeBron. Minny, Atlanta, Detroit, Chicago, Phoenix, and Orlando are all just as good as being awful"
521,2020-03-24 00:22:22,fneg10,They would give up next year's much more valuable pick? I highly doubt that.
522,2020-03-23 19:24:13,fneg10,Gross
523,2020-03-23 20:32:20,fneg10,"Not really for either. Not confident enough in anyone to waste other assets. Rather just rock Hail here.

Maybe a Mavs first for Edwards but unsure. I think y'all would be better off keeping Edwards"
524,2020-03-24 06:57:37,fneg10,Yes our pick and the clippers pick to move up for a second and your 1st this year
525,2020-03-24 00:50:48,fneg10,"If anything I think he's underrated. He's a Uber athletic 4 man who can pick and pop, shoot 3's and make dynamic plays off the dribble for himself or others. Defensively he will struggle guarding NBA 3's but I don't think he will be hopeless against 4's."
526,2020-03-23 20:00:25,fneg10,"> I think a trade up to get Edwards from Cleveland could be interesting

What do you propose that Atlanta could give up in this scenario? I want Cleveland to trade down if we get a top three pick, but the only option that stands out to me is trading back with New York depending on how the lottery goes because they have the Clippers first, the Hornets second, and some other assets. I don't see Atlanta giving up a future first in a likely better class to move up for Edwards."
527,2020-03-24 00:27:06,fneg10,Well there‚Äôs Tyler Bey who would be a great fit with the Raps as well.   He fits the OG Anunoby role but obviously older and not as heralded a prospect. He‚Äôs definitely more likely to be available where you guys are picking
528,2020-03-23 22:44:26,fneg10,"Never said anything about shotblocking. Wiseman has the perfect profile to be a player who can take away shots at the rim in a drop defensive scheme. Being able to shut down the paint is incredibly valuable , it‚Äôs not just the shots you block but also the ones you deter the opponent from even taking. 

Rudy Gobert only logs ~2 blocked shots per game, but he has an impact on every single possession whether it‚Äôs recorded in the stat sheet or not. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs been voted as DPOY. Wiseman has similar tools but is better prospect than Gobert was at 19, and has more potential to shoot the ball offensively so it‚Äôs pretty easy to make a case for him in this draft. 

I personally have Edwards #1 but it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if Wiseman goes 1st due to his aforementioned potential. I don‚Äôt think any of these prospects are a home run"
529,2020-03-25 00:43:53,fneg10,"At least Minnesota, ATL, CHI, Phoenix and Orlando have pieces to work with. Cavs have next to nothing along with a horrible owner and a bunch of players who don‚Äôt even wanna be there."
530,2020-03-24 01:27:34,fneg10,Doesn‚Äôt have to be unprotected
531,2020-03-24 17:47:40,fneg10,"Using the Atlanta trade up for DeAndre Hunter as a reference (8, 17, 35, and a protected 2020 first that will probably turn into two seconds for 4, 57, and a conditional 2023 second) I think it will probably take more from New York to move up to #2 from #6."
532,2020-03-24 01:08:58,fneg10,"I don't think he'll be guarding 3's. He'll be guarding 4's or he'll play a lot of small ball 5. As athletic as he is, he'll need to def get quicker on his feet and get the grown man strength in the mix. At the very least one or the other so he can figure it out defensively."
533,2020-03-23 21:38:07,fneg10,"Well if ATL is high enough on Edwards that they'd trade up (again, speculating) that means they probably want to dump one of their other wings to make room.  I'd assume somebody out of Reddish/Huerter/Hunter would be a decent incentive depending on who Cleveland likes out of the bunch.  Cleveland probably wants a 3-D guy given their roster construction, and Melo gives them a legit playmaker.  I have trouble imagining Edwards is a good fit for them if they're moving forward with Sexton as a lead scorer"
534,2020-03-24 00:32:19,fneg10,"My concern with Tyler is his less complete offensive game but I like him too. I also like Patrick Williams (if they wanted more of a project)and Nesmith but they‚Äôre both likely gone by 28 too.

The Raps could also go for someone like Oturu given they need youth at the 5. Or Kira Lewis, but I think they‚Äôll wait until next year before looking for their next PG."
535,2020-03-23 23:11:28,fneg10,"I agree. There's no clear choice No. 1 pick in this draft. 

Any team that drafts Wiseman, however, will likely have a long wait for him to develop. His rookie NBA season will be the equivalent of his freshman year in college, and he and his team still have to figure out what kind of player he is.

Is he a post center? Is he a stretch 4 or 5?

In either case, he doesn't have any back to the basket moves or a perimeter shot that will translate to the NBA, at least not yet.

And although he can block shots, he hasn't demonstrated the ability to bang with large NBA bodies in the paint or defend the perimeter.

He might be the next Giannis, who was drafted relatively late in 2013 or he might not.

In any case, he's more of a project than Edwards, IMO. Edwards has warts, no doubt about it, but he knows who he is as a player and has scoring skills that should translate to the NBA"
536,2020-03-25 00:51:23,fneg10,"I mean Sexton is an objectively nice piece, Kevin Porter Junior is the best kept secret in the league, and they‚Äôre going to have massive cap space this summer and the next. Also have a decent haul of picks. I‚Äôd rather be them than Minny, Chicago, and Orlando. KAT and D-Lo are gone and Minny has to overpay Beasley soon. Chicago with GarPax is awful and Orlando has to pay Issac, Fultz, Bamba in the coming years and they have Okeke and a another non-lottery pick coming down the drain. 

Gilbert is bad, but they have flexibility"
537,2020-03-24 01:22:50,fneg10,"Yeah I am not sure Bey is an NBA caliber offensive player either , just that for where the Raps are picking he‚Äôs an option. And they‚Äôve had more success with those types of players than most teams. 

If you guys don‚Äôt bring back Ibaka/Gasol, then Oturu or Xavier Tillman could be young options at the 5"
538,2020-03-24 00:31:18,fneg10,"I think the teams who are drafting him to be their #1 option (which would
be absolutely stupid) will have to wait cause that ain‚Äôt happening any time soon. 

For a team with experienced guard play - like say GSW, Washington.. I do feel Wiseman would more or less hit the ground running. His flaws won‚Äôt be as pronounced if he has good playmaking and spacing around him . Just tell him to grab rebounds and sprint in the general direction of the basket, as long as he can catch a pass Steph will make the game easy for him. Or playing with a guard like Bradley Beal who gets double and triple-teamed , Wiseman will have 5 open dunks per game. Once he starts hitting trailer threes (and I don‚Äôt doubt GSW can improve his  shot) you have yourself a stronger Myles Turner. 

IMO Edwards is much more of a project as of now. He has to actually learn the nuances of elite guard/wing play whereas Wiseman can have an impact just from being big and running the floor. But the long term pay off with Ant could be much higher."
539,2020-03-24 02:45:37,fneg10,My ideal draft is Saddiq Bey at 28 and then Neemias Queta at 58. If that doesn't happen though I'd like to get Oturu and then whoever BPA is in the second.
540,2020-03-24 03:53:45,fneg10,"you might be right. I don't have a crystal ball

But I'm not sure that Wiseman gives you much more than Chriss or JaVale McGhee

Giannis would be his ultimate ceiling, and he could get there, but who knows.

Edwards is a natural scorer and no team, even the Warriors, can have too many of those"

556,2020-03-22 00:43:35,fmqmdb,Mavs can't trade their first because of the Stepien rule
557,2020-03-22 00:45:36,fmqmdb,No one's trading a first round pick for Julius
558,2020-03-22 06:51:42,fmqmdb,"Mavs don't do this. All the Mavs big men are rim runners. Boban is the exception but he's on a cheap contract and doesn't play much anyway. The reason they have the number 1 offense in the league right now is cause there is no one clogging up the paint.

He also doesn't improve their interior defense which is what the Mavs would probably like to help shore up

They're also saving up cap space for 2021 like most teams"
559,2020-03-22 02:21:12,fmqmdb,I'm 100% down for this if Dallas does it. I'd probably do it as well if they just want to swap firsts (may need to give us a second as well to sweeten the deal)
560,2020-03-22 06:31:06,fmqmdb,"Who is the ‚Äòsalary filler‚Äô supposed to be from Dallas? Powell and (Wright, Kleber or Curry) get the numbers to match, but those guys aren‚Äôt exactly filler, especially if you‚Äôre hoping for picks coming back to NY... Just doesn‚Äôt seem to be a viable destination for Randle."
561,2020-03-22 16:29:16,fmqmdb,Mavs say no
562,2020-03-22 04:16:08,fmqmdb,"He's also from Dallas and they really wanted him after his last year with LA. Even before we got rid of KP, I was saying how good a fit them 2 would be together.

Julius can play the 5 on offense and the 4 on defense. KP can play the 4 on offense and the 5 on defense."
563,2020-03-22 03:03:41,fmqmdb,Maybe minnesota's 2nd 1st at 16 would be a more realistic trade up option
564,2020-03-22 17:53:40,fmqmdb,"Even if this was possible we are shooting ourselves in the foot for the unprotected pick in 2021.

So many things can change in an 82 game season with injuries, and other teams playing better/worse.

As much as people give Julias shit, next to shooters, a talented ball handler and good spacing he will be a contributing factor to winning games. 

Is there a chance their entire roster stays healthy and they out perform this season? Absolutely, yet there is also the same chance they lose players in FA or injury (hopefully not, don‚Äôt wish that on anyone but it‚Äôs a reality) that change their team chemistry enough to put them in low lottery/early First round territory."
565,2020-03-22 18:23:47,fmqmdb,Lol another disaster like dumping THJ. when our talent improves so will Randle. Bright young player
566,2020-03-22 01:04:34,fmqmdb,Damn. Bro put a lot of effort into this post and you sniped it in like .03 seconds.
567,2020-03-22 01:53:08,fmqmdb,"Can't they pick for the Knicks and trade the rights, though?"
568,2020-03-22 01:23:59,fmqmdb,Then we can pick swap with the clippers pick and they throw an extra 2nd
569,2020-03-22 02:20:04,fmqmdb,They can make the pick and give us the rights to the players
570,2020-03-24 17:11:43,fmqmdb,I think they could do it after the draft. Probably better off with Donnie Nelson making the pick anyway
571,2020-03-22 04:00:54,fmqmdb,"Randle isn't trash. Offensively he's good, solid 18 points a game he's giving you with 8 rebounds.

Most guys picked at 18 don't turn out as good as Randle. And there's not many players that the Mavs can get to improve there team this off season."
572,2020-03-22 08:40:53,fmqmdb,I mean Randle is better offensively than any of those rim runners and the Mavs can cut him loose for only a 4 million dollar cap hit.
573,2020-03-22 11:45:30,fmqmdb,Probably Dorian Finney Smith and Max
574,2020-03-22 05:49:13,fmqmdb,Depends how they feel about KAT and Randle

577,2020-03-22 15:02:56,fmqmdb,He isn't trash. If your trying to win an NBA title you stay away from players like randle. Bigs who can't defend the paint is a no go. Mavs can do better
578,2020-03-22 08:38:25,fmqmdb,That team isn't gonna guard anybody. if we gave them a S+T for harkless in exchange for two seconds then they could get randle and fill a need.
579,2020-03-22 15:50:21,fmqmdb,If he's your starting big then yes it's an issue but if he's coming off the bench it's fine

652,2020-03-17 05:04:42,fjv9bd,"The artist that broke me through to hip-hop and rap was Masta Ace
 
Specifically his tracks *Take a Walk* and *Soda and Soap*
 
Take a Walk broke me through because it talks about serious issues
 
Soda and Soap broke me through because it's the opposite, it's silly and fun and lyrically interesting, Masta Ace uses different names of sodas and soaps to tell a story
 
e.g. I went to a Mountain, Dew a little skiing
 
The Mouse and the Mask by Danger Doom (MF Doom and Danger Mouse) is a lot of fun, I didn't get into it until later and honestly I generally find it more.. chaotic than other albums. But it's a fun one
 
If you like either of the Masta Ace songs I recommend checking out the albums that they are from they both have really good stuff and both are concept albums. Definitely in my most listened to albums right up there with the likes of metal legends Opeth. In fact when I am testing out new audio equipment my two go to albums are Masta Ace - Disposable Arts and Opeth - Ghost Reveries"

659,2020-03-17 18:26:24,fjv9bd,"I know you weren't asking for more songs you'd like, but...I've got a few that you could add! I'm a fan of rap, but I totally get people who /aren't/. I've got your back, bros.

Nightmare Parade - FAKE TYPE; It's considered part of the J-rock genre, but FAKE TYPE has mentioned that Nightmare Parade was intended to be J-rap.

Wii Tennis - 420 Unlovable/Splash Daddy; It's upbeat and silly, and it's nice to listen to, while still being /rap./ It's one of my favorites.

Caligula - Ghostemane; This is sort of an alternative rap thing. Ghostemane is considered the NIN of rap, and fuck, I love him for it. This song makes me feel like punching someone in the face and then getting a tattoo on my own. (Another good song by Ghostemane is The Singularity!)

Just about anything by Yung Gravy. Like Wii Tennis, his music is really funny to listen to, while still being good! His mic quality is really crisp, though, so if you have sensitive ears, his music won't be for you.

TROUBLE BUSTERS - BiBi; Okay, this one is anime. It's a nice mix between video-gamey music and rap...but more of the first one. Pile, the voice actor for one of the members of BiBi, mentioned that they were going for a rap sound, so I'm adding it to the list.

Kill me for it, but Linkin Park is good for any aspiring rap fans. They're a bit of a pathetic excuse for rap, but hey, rap is rap. I don't like them personally, but you might!"

The way I like to think about it is avoiding the temptation to try and be ""right"" or to ""win"" and to focus on what you actually want from a situation.

Often you can be wrong and get what you want or be right but get nothing."
692,2020-03-13 16:05:24,fhz12i,Thank you for this!
693,2020-03-13 16:38:56,fhz12i,"Thanks you so much, I really needed to read this, I faced exactly that kind of situation at work today, I m usually calm with a lot of patience but I lost it today and got very angry (to the point I wanted to physically fight for it, I didn't though). I will try to ""be water"" thanks for the learn"

700,2020-03-13 20:10:20,fhz12i,"My martial arts instructor told me that our brain is our greatest weapon and tool.Without the calmness and confidence then nothing can work in our favor so meditation is a great choice for combining these things.My first taste of meditation was 50 years ago taught by a Kung foo monk, and I never quit meditation after that.My brains has got me out of more situations than I can count and it still works to good effect after all these years of use."

704,2020-03-13 22:40:28,fhz12i,"I trained in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu for 4 years and the most important lesson I learned was on day one of my training. My professor asked all of us why we want to learn to fight, most of the responses were ""to be able to defend myself"" or ""to get stronger"". He then said ""the reason we all should be learning to fight is so that we don't have to"". It took me some time to fully grasp that concept but when I did, it quickly became my motto in training."

715,2020-03-14 06:22:44,fhz12i,"This is true but I also have the utmost respect for people who enter and deal with difficult situations even though they are literally trembling.  While I don't personally believe it to be the most optimal body/mind for dealing with challenges I can't help but respect the courage that it must take that person given that the fears are physically manifesting.

I have noticed over time too that people that keep entering and dealing become calmer with time though in some cases (occupations such as paramedics etc) there is always (while on the job) a level of ""yellow alert.""  This is most likely why the friends I've had who have been paramedics have burned out after around 20 years of it or so."

800,2020-04-18 23:25:31,g3uzw6,First thing that sticks out is Saddiq Bey would be sown a lot further for me
801,2020-04-18 23:43:59,g3uzw6,Okongwu at 8 and Stewart at 52 after Stewart dominated him on both ends during both games this year is interesting. OO got exposed during that game and he has no ability to deal with strength. any team will be able to throw a second string bruising center at OO and he‚Äôs going to crumble
802,2020-04-19 01:07:09,g3uzw6,"Cool board, and I like the Vassell love. How high is too for him in this draft? 

A player like him always seem to have rules and criteria‚Äôs why he should not be a top pick, then a middle-of-the pack team scoops him up and he does nothing but produce, elevating said team next season and beyond.

Edit ‚Äî I‚Äôm also wondering the same about Maxey. I like both of these players quite a bit and think they both should be top 6 picks."
803,2020-04-19 08:40:37,g3uzw6,Interesting take. I'm an IA state homer so love Haliburton obviously. The kid has great vision/high IQ and will continue to grow each year imo. He is incredibly lengthy and will be a defensive threat at the next level. Hayes looks very solid as well. I'm interested to see how Wiseman and Anthony fit because people are either really high on them or the opposite. I like Maxey in the top 10 also
804,2020-04-18 23:52:44,g3uzw6,Killian Hayes looks pretty convincing
805,2020-04-19 00:57:20,g3uzw6,This is terrible in my opinion
806,2020-04-19 18:51:23,g3uzw6,Definitely doesn‚Äôt have the movement skills of a Covington.  Nor the playmaking ability on defense
807,2020-04-19 22:36:40,g3uzw6,I like your board. I have Bolmaro way higher (top 20 for me) and you're a good bit higher on Oturu than I am. Have you checked out Grant Riller? One of the best off-the-dribble creators in the class imo. He is pretty old though...
808,2020-04-18 22:51:13,g3uzw6,Carey in the second round? Hell nah
809,2020-04-19 00:23:01,g3uzw6,What's the justification for having Edwards and Haliburton over Hayes?
810,2020-04-18 23:17:34,g3uzw6,In general I favor wings/guards who can shoot. Hence my high placement for Bey. Terry I looked at KOC's big board and then did my own research on him and I can see the hype around him. Definitely gonna be a controversial prospect!
811,2020-04-18 23:17:52,g3uzw6,Appreciate it. Thanks for looking at it!
812,2020-04-18 23:57:04,g3uzw6,"There's no ""disqualification"" on any of these until at least 3 years from now."
813,2020-04-18 23:46:06,g3uzw6,Is it though? What is it about Wiseman's scouting report that makes you think he's likely to be more than an obsolete rim running center? I see his range of outcomes as somewhere between Cauley-Stein and Gobert which makes him good value at 13 but not exactly a steal
814,2020-04-18 23:16:33,g3uzw6,Yeah he definitely has upside I just didn't trust the sample size with him and the fact that he's limited in horizontal mobility.
815,2020-04-19 01:42:52,g3uzw6,"Give me a likely outcome where Wiseman is any better than an average starting center. What does he improve? He‚Äôs really poor as a pick and roll defender, his hands are really bad, his shot is flat and doesn‚Äôt project to three, and he doesn‚Äôt move well laterally. 

Center has the highest replacement level in the NBA, do you want to spend a lottery pick on a replacement level center when you can find them in free agency for $5m a year? I‚Äôd rather roll the dice with a wing player with versatility or a potential initiator"
816,2020-04-18 23:26:30,g3uzw6,I think in this draft I'm looking for a potentially game-breaking skill. Terry I think can get to that level as a shooter/distributor. And yeah KOC's big board definitely turned me onto Terry haha. Thanks for reading!
817,2020-04-18 23:19:30,g3uzw6,Thanks for reading! Jalen Smith is definitely my most out there placement on the board. I just was really convinced by what I saw of him in college as a shooter and rim protector. He'll need to get stronger to be a defensive difference in the NBA but I really liked what I saw at Maryland.
818,2020-04-19 18:45:50,g3uzw6,"How is Bey not simply a Covington clone? No more, no less. Every team with a star wants that more than ""potential"". I don't see how he doesn't go top 10."
819,2020-04-18 22:36:48,g3uzw6,I think Avdija that low is kinda ridiculous considering many have him as top 5.
820,2020-04-18 23:24:48,g3uzw6,I'll look into it!
821,2020-04-19 00:05:01,g3uzw6,We'll see!
822,2020-04-18 23:24:28,g3uzw6,Yeah I'll admit that my research on Bolmaro wasn't that strong. From what I watched though I just wasn't too impressed. Thanks for reading!
823,2020-04-19 18:50:06,g3uzw6,He looks like a replica of Covington. That's what everyone wants right?
824,2020-04-18 23:31:37,g3uzw6,Yeah that's a fair complaint. I just like his shooting and defensive promise. He definitely isn't the most fluid mover but I like what he brings. Also I like wings a LOT more than bigs as you can probably tell. Thanks for reading!
825,2020-04-19 00:04:48,g3uzw6,Yeah I definitely paid attention to that game. Was not encouraging for Okongwu at all. The stark difference between Okongwu and Stewart just came down to upside. I would say though that I am not particularly strong at evaluating big guys.
826,2020-04-19 03:02:30,g3uzw6,"> How high is too for him in this draft? A player like him always seem to have rules and criteria‚Äôs why he should not be a top pick

I think he‚Äôs a go after the top 3. The reason guys like him usually aren‚Äôt top picks is because the guys above them have more upside and/or can impact a game more. Looking at the past 5 or so drafts I‚Äôd probably take him at then end of the lottery or at #15 but in this years draft I think he‚Äôs fair game after Ball/Wiseman/Edwards depending on fit.

Those are really the guys with high end upside and everybody else is basically destined to be a starter/role player that would have to have a lot of things break fright for them to be a star. Vassell fits in here and so if he feels like the right fit for a team I think it‚Äôs smart to take him because he‚Äôs a sure case that has some upside as a 3rd/4th scorer."
827,2020-04-19 01:17:35,g3uzw6,"Honestly I'm not sure. I've been super high on Vassell since like January when he was first starting to be regularly talked about. He went from a second round pick to a possible top 10 pick in like 3 months. I'm a Bulls fan so seeing that Vassell would fill a need, I wouldn't mind them taking him at 5-6. I want Haliburton first for the Bulls then either Ball or Vassell. It'll vary from team to team but I don't think any team should be discouraged from taking him in the top 7. Thanks for reading!"
828,2020-04-19 00:05:31,g3uzw6,The more I watch him the more I like him. Could easily slide into the top 2 for me.
829,2020-04-19 00:59:13,g3uzw6,Appreciate the feedback!
830,2020-04-19 23:09:50,g3uzw6,Thanks for reading! And yeah Bolmaro is one of those guys who will probably rise on my board after watching him more in depth. Riller is the Charleston guy right? I think Sam Vecenie from The Athletic had him top 30 in his latest big board. I'll definitely check him out.
831,2020-04-18 23:25:16,g3uzw6,He might go in the first round. This is a big board rather than a mock draft. Thanks for reading!
832,2020-04-19 00:51:58,g3uzw6,"With Edwards it's the physical gifts that he possesses. He's not consistent obviously, and his defense leaves a LOT to be desired, but it's just an upside play with him. With Haliburton, I love his playmaking ability. He also has a really infectious personality and is a smart kid. His film session with Mike Schmitz really won me over. Good length for a PG and despite his weird mechanics he was a knockdown shooter. Hayes I still really like. He's a guy that as we progress through May/June/July I could have him moving up to as high as 1. Right now though what troubles me is that his handle isn't that strong and he never goes right. That being said, he's been really effective for Ulm without a right hand, so maybe I should have him higher!"
833,2020-04-18 23:20:39,g3uzw6,"100%! Especially with Trae Young playing as he has will make near playoff teams think he could be the difference maker, looking at you Orlando"
834,2020-04-18 23:59:45,g3uzw6,You‚Äôre welcome. Look forward to seeing what you post in the future.
835,2020-04-19 00:01:10,g3uzw6,That's kinda my thoughts on him as well. If he had more of a skill package in place I'd put him higher but I just don't see that yet.
836,2020-04-18 23:51:27,g3uzw6,There‚Äôs other games besides just him at Memphis
837,2020-04-19 21:00:53,g3uzw6,Yeah I like Bey a lot. He seems like a high floor top 10 pick to me.
838,2020-04-18 22:43:29,g3uzw6,I think he will end up going in the 5-10 range with late lottery being the latest he'll go. You never know what might happen with medical evals or team interviews though. Look at Robert Williams.
839,2020-04-18 23:23:41,g3uzw6,"My main worry with Avdija is more of a trend situation. If you go back to international players who played overseas that were selected in the top 10, there's a huge discrepancy in production between players who started for their teams and those who didn't. Deni didn't start for Maccabi so I worry about how he'll translate to the NBA. For example players like Dragon Bender, Darko Milicic, and Mario Hezonja all did not start while Porzingis, Luka, and Dirk all started. Just a trend thing more than anything else."
840,2020-04-18 23:27:09,g3uzw6,Yeah I don‚Äôt really like him but he isn‚Äôt that bad.
841,2020-04-18 23:38:25,g3uzw6,Yeah definitely.  Same here.  I actually don‚Äôt think Saddiq has the movement skills to play on the wing in the NBA.  I think of him more as a combo forward in terms of how he will translate to the NBA.  He‚Äôs got pretty stiff hips and I think the game will be too quick for him at the next level if he‚Äôs on the wing.  We will see though!
842,2020-04-19 07:14:26,g3uzw6,Love this response
843,2020-04-18 23:29:00,g3uzw6,Yeah I'd love that for Orlando. Nothing against Vucevic or Fournier but they just aren't the most exciting players haha.
844,2020-04-19 00:02:42,g3uzw6,Thanks!
845,2020-04-19 02:03:47,g3uzw6,"He has a great skill package for a 7‚Äô1 teenager. You don‚Äôt see it because he played 3 games at Memphis and did what the coaching staff asked him to do: dominate the interior. In HS he showed a promising handle, faceup game, and decent jumpshot.

Bam Adebayo‚Äôs stock plummeted at Kentucky because ppl thought the same thing (ohh he‚Äôs just a rim-running big) then the Heat brought him in workouts and realized a lot of the skill was hidden in college. Fast forward a few years and the skill package he has has been harvested."
846,2020-04-19 00:02:23,g3uzw6,My rule is that I use AAU stuff for college evaluations and then college stuff for NBA evaluation. I don't think seeing Wiseman dunk on everyone in high school really gives me a good enough foundation.
847,2020-04-18 23:01:11,g3uzw6,Robert Williams or Nasir little are good examples but Deni is considered top 3 by a lot and I‚Äôd say the majority believe he is top 5 or top 7
848,2020-04-18 23:26:21,g3uzw6,"That is true.A common misconception that Americans do is that they think that just because they play in the euro league they are auto busts/great picks.Ex Hezonja and Doncic,one was MVP the other 7th-9th man. With that being said Avdija played great in the u20 tournament and shows true promise in a weak class.Last year I would have him in the 10-20 range, but this year I‚Äôd say top 5."
849,2020-04-20 23:48:59,g3uzw6,"Honestly,  I don't think any of the other top prospect in this draft would start on his team. As being said, he's playing in a top 5 team in Europe, a team  that only care about winning now, with a massive noisy crowd, that have no patience for mistakes. You guys really see players like LaMelo, Edwards, Haliburton, Okoro etc.  starting in their lineup? because I don't. They are too raw and  inefficient as a teenagers who just started to learn the game. These elite European teams are all about experienced players.  Watching Hayes  for example, he is playing in the worst team in the EuroCup, a much  weaker league than the Euroleague, and I'm 100% sure he wouldn't get  minutes at all at Deni's team, not even off the bench). So the fact Deni actually have a big  role there is speak for itself."
850,2020-04-19 00:03:47,g3uzw6,"Yeah that is definitely my primary concern with him. I just think in a draft this barren of explosive talent, he seems like a safer top ten pick."
851,2020-04-19 02:27:41,g3uzw6,"Dude I looked at his stats and he put up fucking 

20/11 and 3 blocks in **23 minutes per game**

Small sample size but still"
852,2020-04-19 01:17:13,g3uzw6,"
Yeah but when you‚Äôre talking about not enough sample size then that‚Äôs your best option instead of underranking him. 

How will you do your draft board if/when the one and done rule is abolished?

Where would you have had the high school guys of the 2000s in your draft ranks with limited samples?"
853,2020-04-18 23:30:21,g3uzw6,Yeah there are definitely things to like about Avdija. He's also playing on a really good international team so that's also a factor.
854,2020-04-19 02:34:42,g3uzw6,"Lol yeah I think ppl are overthinking it and trying to act like they‚Äôre ‚Äúabove the hype‚Äù or thinking physical tools matter. Even if he barely improves his skill, he‚Äôs a dominating inside presence and there‚Äôs more than a negligible difference between him and the cheap, replacement-level ones you can get in FA."
855,2020-04-19 02:09:16,g3uzw6,">How will you do your draft board if/when the one and done rule is abolished?

Thank you! I always see ppl say they don‚Äôt value HS tape or something along those lines and I think it‚Äôs such a cop-out. In reality they just don‚Äôt know how to, or afraid to, glean the value out of them.

They act like it doesn‚Äôt count when pretty soon it‚Äôs gonna be all you have to go off. Is all of Emoni Bates tape just going to be invalid? And we should just knock him down the boards in favor of ‚Äúproven‚Äù college guys"
856,2020-04-18 23:31:37,g3uzw6,"Yeah he is in a top 5 euro team,so basically the 35th best team in the world,which tbh the 5 best euro teams could beat the Warriors without Curry and Dray."
857,2020-04-19 03:02:51,g3uzw6,"Do you know why he played so few minutes those three games?

 I looked and he wasn‚Äôt even in foul trouble (maybe one game but I don‚Äôt think so)"
858,2020-04-19 02:31:44,g3uzw6,"Yeah exactly, is this guy taking Bosh, Melo, Wade, Darko, etc. ahead of LeBron cuz there‚Äôs only high school tape?"
859,2020-04-19 03:06:14,g3uzw6,The first two games they won by ~40 and the Oregon game he was in a bit of foul trouble iirc.
860,2020-04-19 04:26:44,g3uzw6,"That's a fair point. I don't think it's fair, however, to be comparing LeBron and James Wiseman. Wiseman is nowhere near the level of prospect where you can just bet on his high school tape. Emoni Bates? Yes."

866,2020-04-18 07:12:58,g3ct94,I thought it was a good movie. The only thing I would change would be the title; The Kung Fu Kid.
867,2020-04-18 02:04:01,g3ct94,I really enjoy it. People just get mad it‚Äôs named after the one from the 80s
868,2020-04-18 06:43:55,g3ct94,That‚Äôs really my only actual complaint about the movie. I guess they wanted to try for the nostalgia points? Or maybe they didn‚Äôt want to be called a rip-off so they called it a remake? I dunno.

975,2020-04-16 00:43:28,g1w7ad,"https://www.consumerreports.org/water-filters/make-sure-your-water-filter-removes-lead/

""A problem with high levels of lead in Newark‚Äôs drinking water led the city last year to distribute water filters to residents. But that plan hit a snag this week when the Environmental Protection Agency alerted the city that drinking water in two of three homes it tested still had high levels of lead, despite the filters.¬†

The EPA advised Newark residents to stop drinking tap water and urged the city to supply bottled water instead (though that solution also ran into problems when the city learned some of the water had passed its expiration date).""

I left in the part about expired bottled water to remain honest about the fact that bottled water, in particular where it is bottled in plastic or glass, has a lot of problems. If you truly take your water bottle everywhere and never drink bottled beverages then I am proud of you - but there are places where the water is bad enough to require reverse osmosis filtration. That can cost over $1000 and require regular maintenance going beyond that. Even where the lead levels are lower:


""Faucet-mount filters, like those used in Flint and Newark, typically cost $20 to $40 and require several installation steps that can go awry.¬†

'These filters are not easy to get onto the faucets,' McElmurry says. 'We found that a lot of people in Flint with arthritis or poor motor function in their hands couldn‚Äôt attach them.'

In addition, faucet-mounted filters often require special adapters or don‚Äôt fit on faucets at all. If the filter or adapter doesn‚Äôt sit properly in the housing, some water could bypass the filter and go straight into your drinking glass.""

It's definitely far from the best solution, but for some people in a wide range of circumstances it's the easiest way for them to feel safe drinking water. Even if those people are wrong and they live somewhere with great municipal water, we are better off encouraging this kind of reinvestment into community water supplies and requiring less of the environmentally destructive shipping and packing vs Nestle et al"

984,2020-04-16 05:29:39,g1w7ad,"Nope. The diversion from a clean water source to a poisoned one was purely for the political and monetary gain of a few. What's worse? The people of Flint were told that the water they were drinking was SAFE! We only know about this because a group of desperate residents went on am ardrous legal crusade to obtain proper information about the water they drank and bathed their kids with and which had become visibly contaminated. Do you understand the gross neglect that goes on when officials LIE about their failures to properly treat the unnecessarily diverted pipelines leading to the erosion in the pipes and the contamination, all he while attempting to defame the concerned citizens that brought it up? People in Flint shouldn't have trusted their government then and I don't blame them in the slightest for continuing to feel that way.

So yes they need to replace many many miles of pipes, including in peoples homes. Im not sure why they didnt simply switch back to the detroit water supply."

I am always sceptical when I hear these stories of one guy messed up and that is why this entire city doesn't have clean water.

It can happen everywhere I understand but apparently there was this big social media thing about America forgetting flint had bad water. They were of the opinion that it was not a priority of American government to fix this. To the extend that celebrities and even companies reached out with solutions. That would not happen where I live. That is the only thing I wanted to say.

At this point they can put out whatever they want and I‚Äôll still admire the long way they‚Äôve come, whether it suits my musical taste or not. The Violence isn‚Äôt my cup of tea, and to my liking They Don‚Äôt Want... is a step up. While I personally think it was a dick move to tease the breakdown of the song on IG it was something that was expected at this point and after coming to terms with that I‚Äôm beginning to genuinely enjoy DTH. 

The thing is, they‚Äôre not passionate about playing *heavier* tunes anymore (based on what they‚Äôve put out) and I‚Äôd rather see them play what they like now than force themselves to play something they just don‚Äôt *feel* to please the fans.

So even if the album disappoints, I wouldn't care much. But I do hope for something better than Down To Hell. I liked the first three singles and enjoy the teasers for In My Blood and One Turns To None, so...it's a ""let's see what will happen"" type of deal."
1047,2020-04-18 11:50:37,g1voi7,"You know I'm going to be completely honest here and I've been listening to this band for a good while now since probably late 2011ish but I have a bad feeling that this will probably be the worst album that they've ever made based off of how all of the singles have been sounding like. I know people will sit there and also say like ""Oh the rest of the album hasn't come out yet so you never know what it will sound like fully"" but this bands sound took an opposite 180 it seems once Danny came back and especially with the self-titled album. I actually enjoyed FDTD a lot because it had a hybrid of styles from the first two albums and it wasn't too heavy and it wasn't too soft sounding either. If they could make every album in the FDTD formula and incorporate new elements and build on that progression then I wouldn't mind it at all. I also really enjoyed Denis Stoff's time with the band when he was on ""The Black"" album even though it seems like a lot of long time AA fans shit on it for whatever reason. I realize Danny tore his vocal chords though so they probably will never go for a totally heavy route again obviously from like SUAS and R&R and I still won't give up on this band but I guess I'll give this new album a shot. With that being said and if this new record totally bombs then I'm probably just gonna stop listening to the new stuff altogether."

I can't crucify the guys just for trying new things, if I don't like it, it doesn't mean other folks didn't.

Think of all the times they talked shit about Danny not wanting to make heavy music anymore and as soon as Dennis leaves, because they have no other option, the band becomes hard rock.

>Across 112 games dating back to the 2018 FIBA World Cup, Deni Avdija has shot 28.3% from 3 (318 attempts) and 53.9% from the line (230 attempts)

I normally dont like holding players accountable for their percentages as a teenager, but the free throw numbers are hard for me to ignore. In this draft I still think hes a top 5 talent but I am not as comfortable with his floor as I once was."
1059,2020-04-15 04:03:36,g1fur2,"I really can't see a couple of fits in this draft. 

1. Cole Anthony to the timberwolves at #5 seems like a pretty bad fit for me considering their roster already has Russell to run point and is in major need of athletic defensive forwards. I could maybe understand a couple of the bigger better defensive guards as the pick if you don't believe in Beasley as their 2, but with Anthony just 6ft 3, him and Russell would be terrible on defense. Also it's not exactly a seamless fit on offense either with one of them undoubtedly having to learn to play significantly more off ball. 
2. I will agree with you that RJ Hampton would provide a much needed secondary ball handler for the Hawks, but the Hawks need defense and 3 point shooting out of their pick more than that. I am doubtful that RJ projects to be able to provide either of those at a high level so I am not a fan of this pick.
3. Tyrese Maxey to the wizards does not make very much sense to me unless you think they trade Beal and go full on rebuild. Both Beal and Maxey are already slightly undersized at the 2 and would get absolutely torched at the 3 so I really don't know how you could make this work unless you think Maxey could play minutes as a point guard, which I don't."

1065,2020-04-27 03:41:18,g1fur2,"In terms of talent, this is really one of the weakest drafts I‚Äôve seen in a long time. Zero impact guys at the top, and a lot of average in the middle."
1066,2020-04-15 02:08:26,g1fur2,Hate this draft for us
1067,2020-04-15 04:52:50,g1fur2,"I appreciate your post and position, though I will say not all fits are perfect or at most optimal depending on the lens you look through. 

1. I could understand why you say that about Anthony and I‚Äôd respectfully rebuttal by saying that the T‚ÄôWolves just need more talent in general and from my POV specifically someone who can create their own shot. D-Lo and Cole wouldn‚Äôt be an exact ideal fit, but also based off your statement and the players available I don‚Äôt think you can insert any other one player that would be absolutely more optimal. Between Beasley, Okogie, and Culver you already have enough bigger guards/wings that are unable to create offense on their own, be it for themself or others. You could put Okoro maybe here or even Haliburton if you think he could mesh well with D-Lo, but Okoro seems somewhat redundant and not enough of a difference maker when considering some other players they have and Haliburton is arguable about how effective he would be both personally and collectively alongside Russell. Both also seems like reaches at that spot. At the least Cole could come in and spell D-Lo from being the sole initiator of offense and offer you another guard who could get his own shot. I agree that it may not be an optimal fit, but I‚Äôll argue you to find a better one, specifically at that spot. 

2. RJ to the Hawks is beauty in eye of the beholder. You could argue the Hawks need more shooting, yet a very valid point could be made that they need an athletic bigger guard to help assist Trae and the entire team‚Äôs effectiveness on perimeter defense and add a much needed secondary ball-handler ‚Äî as you mentioned ‚Äî simultaneously. They have shooters on the wing in Huerter and Reddish, what they don‚Äôt have is a backcourt/perimeter player of Hampton‚Äôs profile to help ‚Äòprotect‚Äô and pair with Trae, while adding to the overall construction of the team as a whole. I will say that Hampton has a lot of projection to fulfill his potential and you could place maybe a surer bet at this spot, though I believe with his upside and contrast to Trae‚Äôs game it would allow RJ to grow organically and still have Trae be able to play his game more effectively without having to sacrifice what he does well in order to accommodate him. The makings of a backcourt consisting of Trae Young, Hampton, Huerter, Reddish, combined with Hunter, Collins, and Capela in the front court presents an exciting young team in the East that can continue to grow in the right direction and compete for a playoff spot in the East in the coming years. Potentially as soon as next season if things were to shake right and other astute transactions were made to supplement that young core. 

3. Maxey may seem redundant with Beal in the fold, yet you‚Äôd be hard pressed to argue you‚Äôll get a better value at that pick. The Wizards are in rebuild mode already and would be in full-on rebuild mode if they were to move Beal, in which case Maxey would make even more sense to have in the fold for the future to go along with whatever assets you receive in return in a deal for Beal. Should John Wall be able to return and have any elements of effectiveness then having Maxey as depth behind Wall and Beal is a positive proposition, if you ask me. At worst, the Wizards need backcourt help/talent as much as any team in the league and while Maxey may seem similar to Beal already, it‚Äôd be difficult to deter yourself from selecting him at that spot in search of a better ‚Äòfit‚Äô that for all intents and purposes would net you a lesser player. Again, Okoro or Haliburton could be a fit at this spot. Haliburton, especially. But then if Wall were to come back (a contract they are inevitably going to be stuck with) and then you move Beal to try and get back as much as you can, you‚Äôre looking at being left with a backcourt of Wall and Haliburton that doesn‚Äôt help much."
1068,2020-04-14 23:48:05,g1fur2,"True tea. He was one name I knew going in I‚Äôd be interest to see where might slot. 

I‚Äôm aware Mannion is a consensus 1st round prospect in most people‚Äôs mind and I‚Äôll admit he has a pretty decent shot at going within in the first 30 picks, I just didn‚Äôt see a natural fit over some other players in specific spots. 

Same could be said for Tre Jones. 

I think there is a real possibility he can fall to the 2nd round, but that fit with the Miami Heat seemed solid."
1069,2020-04-15 07:08:38,g1fur2,"Idk about that one. He could very well go top 10 but top 3 I have a tough time seeing. 

That‚Äôs just me though. I respect your POV and you making that assertion."
1070,2020-04-14 23:08:56,g1fur2,"I‚Äôve seen multiple reports that Golden State would likely take him with their selection if they land the #1 pick. Still I shuffled back and forth between he and Wiseman, while even considering LaMelo. 

Ultimately, I can see and believe the Warriors bringing in Edwards to initially use as their 6th man/OKC version of James Harden and then insert him into the lineup at the end of games allowing Steph to play off the ball on occasion and giving them another able body defender on the perimeter with Klay (similar to how they utilized Iggy in a sense). 

Them along with Wiggins and Draymond could be their end of game lineup in the near future. 

Still it would allow them to groom Edwards into a star who could increasingly grow into assuming more responsibility as Steph and Klay get older. 

I believe he has legitimate James Harden potential with the floor of a Zach Lavine."

1072,2020-04-16 18:41:35,g1fur2,"Some picks aren‚Äôt always a seamless fit. Toppin may seem superfluous with PJ Washington and Miles Bridges (we also saw the Cavs take Sexton and Garland in back to back years), but he would be a quality to player to add at that pick. I actually believe his athleticism would pair well with Washington‚Äôs toughness and their skillsets could mesh well and cause some tough matchups for opposing frontcourts to deal with if they were on the floor together as many teams in the NBA don‚Äôt always happen to play a traditional ‚Äò5. I‚Äôll say Onyeka Okongwu could potentially be a good fit there as well. 

As for why the Cavs would take Wiseman, why not ?. 

Arguably the highest upside of any player in the draft and being as that K-Love situation with the organization is fluid, Tristian Thompson is in the last year of his deal, and while they acquired Drummond there is no guarantee he stays their past next season ‚Äî that‚Äôs if he picks up his player option for next season ‚Äî their frontcourt could stand to add some talent."
1073,2020-04-15 05:06:15,g1fur2,"What else is new for a Knicks fan. LOL üôÉ

You may not like LaMelo but it‚Äôd be difficult not to get excited at his talent and potential when looking at the talent you have in the backcourt currently. As for Carey I believe many analysts and fans are far too foul on him for what he does. He may not excite as an NBA-type athlete but for a big and what he‚Äôs shown himself to be capable of doing you could do a lot worse at the end of the first round."
1074,2020-04-15 05:49:25,g1fur2,"I can respect much of your reasoning and appreciate the manner by which you provide your discourse. Most of our disagreements seem to come down to what need or skillset a particular team should focus on first rather than conflicts over thinking certain players are good or not in general. I started my previous post in a numbered order and you continued it so I might as well for consistency.

1. I'm not particularly high on Cole in general and have him in my 8-12 range so from my POV I wouldn't select him purely based on best player available. Im also not very high on Okoro who you mentioned as I get a lot of MKG vibes from him and would stay clear up until the second half of the lottery. Going based off who you have available at this spot I think I would select Onyeka. He would provide an instant impact as a defensive anchor with lots of room for development offensively. I think they could play him next to towns fairly easily as spacing wouldn't be too much of a concern with Town's great perimeter shooting ability and their rim protection would be markedly better from this year. I don't know how high you have Onyeka on your big board, but for me he seems to be the best combination of fit and best player available.
2. I agree with you a good bit about RJ, but I do think he is a bit of a reach with the 6th pick. Looking through the remaining prospects I am hard pressed to find one I like for the Hawks, but if he were available I would choose Deni. Since he is not and thats pretty unfair since you might have as well if he was available I will counter with Tyrese Haliburton. I think what he lacks in athleticism to RJ he makes up for with more natural ball handling skill which would allow him to at minimum be a quality backup PG. I also think his shooting ability and defense would make it easier for him to play alongside Trae as the 2 guard. Im not completely sold on Huerter as a starter and not a 6th man so if this scenario played out I think Haliburton would be a good do it all option for the Hawks at this pick.
3. I think Maxey is a good player don't get me wrong and I understand this pick a lot more if we are going based on the assumption the wizards are trading Beal. However, I still would rather have Okoro and Onyeka with this pick over Maxey. This is purely a preference thing as in a scenario where Beal is gone the wizards would be in almost complete best player available mode which on my board would be one of these two over Maxey. This is about the range I would be willing to take a chance on Okoro with the swing skill obviously being his jump shot. I really like Onyeka as mentioned above and think he would be a great fit for the Wizards regardless of if they keep Beal or not.
4. I'll also ask a fourth question just to keep this discussion from going stale. Who are some of your sleeper talents within the first round?"

What film have you seen that shows Edwards to be a capable ball handler? His decision making is really poor, he looks like he has his mind made up before the play even develops. He also doesnt have a great handle. He has a decent crossover and in and out dribble, but his lack of feel really limits him from using it effectively against defenders. 

I think the james Harden comp is insane considering the lack of ball handling and the lack of shiftyness. 

I think the best comps for him are a mix between Martell Webster and Dion Waiters. I was higher on Edwards months ago but the more film I see of him the more I think people are being way to optimistic about his upside, he just has to many things that are hard to fix at the NBA level. Lack of feel, ball handling and reading the game arent things you can just improve on. I expect his shot to get better and his handle to get tighter but without a basketball mind he will always struggle to apply those skills in game."

1079,2020-04-16 18:50:09,g1fur2,"Toppin isn't a great fit at all for us. His defense lacks supremely and that's something major for us, we have next to none defensive pieces, why would draft another Stretch four 2 years in row? The difference between this situation and that of Garland and Sexton is that Sexton lacks passing ability and is essientially a 2 guard, Garland plays the point and can run it. Toppin and Washington have near exact same skillsets with worse defense. Even if we did run Toppin or Washington at the 5, that would make no sense. We need a Rim protector or someone who has some sort of defense in their game.

Wiseman, makes zero sense to me for Cleveland. Drummond is most likely to opt in to his player option and has been a loyal player his entire career. The whole thing with Detroit really shouldn't change his attitude towards that. He'll stay. Based on prior evidence there's no reason to suspect he won't. Plus Cleveland is stupid enough to keep re-signing him.

If anything they would probably take Obi."
1080,2020-04-15 06:12:00,g1fur2,"Hayes has a higher floor and not that much less of a ceiling than Lamelo. Hayes also fits the team due to his ability to space now. Why honestly is Lamelo a better draft pick for us? Because ""you got nothing to lose"" because we always have something to lose. 

Carey is just not something I would draft in the first round. There also other options available. Kira Lewis, Isiah Joe, Bolmaro, Poku, Aaron Henry, Tyrell Terry are all players who are available and better than Carey. 

We also don't need a fucking center, why draft someone if they have a zero percent chance to start?"
1081,2020-04-15 06:38:50,g1fur2,"I appreciate and respect your outlook as well as I believe it to be both reasonable and respectable. 

As you mentioned, I believe that our differences lie in team/player fit for the most part. Yet we share enough similarities and specific distinctions to display that we each have our own unique POV which is what evaluating and discussing the draft is all about. 

It‚Äôs been enjoyable to engage in a discussion with you about this upcoming draft and its prospects. I really do appreciate it, again. 

To address some of the things you mentioned, I too am high on OO. I will be in honest in saying that I have yet to construct a comprehensive, concrete big board. But I do have enough knowledge to place players in certain abstract tiers, if you will, at this point to feel comfortable in  slotting them in certain spots. 

With that being said, I can comfortably say that I probably place OO as a top 10-ish prospect in this class. Likely landing somewhere between 6‚Äì12. I‚Äôm high on him and wouldn‚Äôt be upset to see him land with Minnesota or Washington as you mentioned. And not to just agree with you, but the things that you pointed out do make sense and could be easily seen from my POV. 

Some sleepers within the first round for me are Amar Sylla. When you watch him you‚Äôll likely have shades of certain international players in the league who have found success that I‚Äôll hold off on mentioning for a later time, just so that if in fact you do happen to watch and come up with your own comp of him it can be something to discuss down the line. 

But when watching Sylla his motor runs high and his versatility looks legit in translating to the next level with relatively high upside if he can put it altogether. 

I‚Äôd have a hard time saying where I‚Äôd slot him at currently in terms of spots on a big board, specifically. Though I guess where I had him going in the mock might give somewhat of an idea, as of right now. 

Mannion can easily be seen as an oversight so I guess you can mention him to an extent, even though it be difficult to call him to a sleeper and despite the fact I didn‚Äôt have him going in the 1st round in this mock draft. 

As for some other ‚Äòsleepers‚Äô that I did have on the list in this mock draft I‚Äôd say Saddiq Bey is one. His game just says productive pro player to me. Granted his athleticism won‚Äôt wow anyone, but his shot making ability and feel for what his game is gives him a floor as a base that I‚Äôd be willing to bet/build on. 

Jahmi‚Äôus Ramsey is another. His game could use some seasoning for sure to establish himself as a sure bet to be a productive player at the next level but I‚Äôll be honest in saying that I could see myself being convinced that he has a higher ceiling than Smith and Culver coming out of Texas Tech before him. 

Hindsight being 20/20 it can seem easy to say that now, despite the fact both players are still early into their NBA careers, but watching Ramsey he just has a natural talent level, to me, that is somewhat higher than both of those players. He‚Äôs someone I can envision as a riser in future mocks both personally and among the consensus as the pre-draft process pickups and resumes. 

I also used to believe that Patrick Williams of Florida State was a bit of a sleeper when watching him earlier during the college basketball season but it seems that his stock has picked up some traction during mid-to-late January into February that has me comfortable with how I believe he‚Äôs viewed upon currently."

1083,2020-04-16 19:26:36,g1fur2,"I appreciate and don‚Äôt necessarily disagree with your assessment.

I‚Äôm well-aware of Toppin‚Äôs lack of defensive awareness. Neither he or Washington are true rim protectors though I would say that if and when on the floor they could alternate responsibility as weak-side help defenders that could challenge people at the rim and have enough functional agility to deal with the modern day ‚Äò4‚Äôs‚Äô. As I said its not a seamless fit and that was something I was aware when I slotted him there. Though I don‚Äôt believe it to be terrible or altogether a forgone conclusion that wouldn‚Äôt take him at that spot. 

I agree Drummond is likely to opt-in and that the Cavs would be more than willing to pay him, though it is very well possible he doesn‚Äôt end up staying there for the long term as well.

I ventured with the thought of both Advija and Toppin there, amongst other others as well. I believe that pick might be a little rich for Toppin and while he may seem like a better fit for the Cavs roster, I‚Äôd think long and hard about taking him over Wiseman with all things considered."
1084,2020-04-15 07:05:27,g1fur2,"It was more in jest. Though I appreciate your sentiment. Though I can understand why‚Äôd you say Hayes has a higher floor, I wouldn‚Äôt just simply agree with you. Ball‚Äôs floor isn‚Äôt low by any stretch and I‚Äôd be hard pressed to think that if it weren‚Äôt for the narrative surrounding him and his family name that you‚Äôd so easily say that his floor is lower than that of Hayes. 

As for his ceiling that‚Äôs a topic for another day. I‚Äôd say in a simplistic statement/manner Hayes may be anywhere from Markelle Fultz or D‚ÄôAngelo Russell at best, Ball should become D-Lo at worst and maybe a Luka-lite at best. Not saying they‚Äôre exact comps but to illustrate my point those are some players that I‚Äôm comfortable using. 

Also, being though that you guys seem to have difficulty on attracting any superstar or borderline superstar talents recently, I‚Äôd rather go in the direction of Ball than Hayes in that spot, specifically. 

When it comes to Carey I appreciate and understand what you said it as refers to him, as well as the other players you mentioned that could potentially slot in that spot. 

What my thinking was with that pick is that you solidify the ‚Äò5‚Äô spot with Carey coupled with Mitchell Robinson. Two distinctively different players but having them both should make that spot a positive for your roster ‚Äî or at least not a net negative. 

It may not be conventional in today‚Äôs NBA-style but Carey‚Äôs strengths supplement Robinson‚Äôs weaknesses, specifically perimeter shooting and being able to throw the ball to him in or around the paint on something other than a lob and look for him to score. 

Similarly, Robinson strengths offset Carey‚Äôs weaknesses and while they likely won‚Äôt see time together on the floor, combining both their skillsets to pick and choose from given the game situation could have some inkling of success in strategically setting up your roster. 

I‚Äôm intrigued by Bolmaro and do like both Isaiah Joe and Kira Lewis, too. 

Aaron Henry wouldn‚Äôt be a bad fit with Ball and Barrett either, so I commend you for mentioning him as well.

Terry its tough to tell just yet for me what I see him being at the next level and having confidence in it. 

Pokusevski I see more suited as a draft and stash or strictly G-League type player for almost his entire first season or two, which is why I mocked him to the Celtics. As he would be their third 1st round selection and someone whose skilled at his size that could become somewhat of a lottery ticket for them in due time."
1085,2020-04-15 14:58:37,g1fur2,"I agree with most of your sentiments about Sylla. Admittedly prior to today I had watched probably less than five minutes of him as on most big boards he seems to be viewed as a fringe second round guy and I had not really gotten to evaluating him fully yet. After watching roughly 40 min of film on Sylla, I can see why you value him as he is remarkably similar to Sekou Doumbouya who as I'm sure you know was a top 15 pick last year. I will counter however that although they both have the same strength being defense, youth, and athleticism I was much more confident in Sekou's floor than I am with Sylla. Sekou demonstrated he was a competent player in a pretty good European league and showed a failry competent perimeter shot (32%). Sylla on the other hand is pretty woeful from beyond the arc (23%) and is a bit too timid around the basket for my liking. I do think he is a bit of a sleeper though as I would consider him above his projected range in the mid to late second round. From my POV he is a fringe 1st probably early second guy.

Mannion really just projects as a backup point guard from my POV and I would value that late 1st or early second which seems to align with where you have him.

Bey has appeared in the 15-20 range on a lot of the mock drafts Ive looked at, which I think is appropriate. Ill agree that he has a good bit of translatable skills and is an almost sure bet to be a productive role player.

Ramsey is someone I need to watch more of, but based off the very little I've seen he demonstrates a lot of the things that translate well to the NBA and I would agree with the late 1st projection.

Patrick Williams is a monster and should be in the 15-20 range imo. He needs refinement offensively, but he has an NBA ready body and could instantly provide quality minutes off the bench as a Jerami Grant type player. He is also really young, which gives him plenty of time for development.

My controversial take that I will add is that I am really high on Devin Vassell and think he is the best 3-D prospect in this draft. I have him higher than Okoro on my big board, because he is a really good perimeter shooter whereas Okoro struggles from beyond the arc and he is the best team defender in the draft, which is arguably more important than man defense in todays NBA. Stats are not everything, but Devin Vassell is clearly superior to Okoro in that regard. Vassell is a top 12 prospect on my board."
1086,2020-04-14 23:22:10,g1fur2,Forreal? No cap?
1087,2020-04-16 19:54:45,g1fur2,"At least my thought in the draft about Wiseman, I see him falling. Not far, but falling nonetheless. He's only played 3 games on the collegiate level, and that I think will stray people away from him and While Toppin isn't really worth being at the 2nd pick. I legitimately think that, because of the awards he won recently, and the hometown factor, and the fit, more tape, The Cavs will draft him. 

At least for the Hornets, I don't ever see them straying anywhere near to Toppin. Regardless of what could possibly happen, it's still a janky fit. Okongwu or Wiseman make much more sense in these positions. Okongwu is better at defense and could fit the teams needs much better. And can shoot the 3 if needed.

Wiseman is a rim protector, someone like Hassan Whiteside, rebounder, gets putbacks and can occasionally shoot a mid-range. This also makes much more sense then as opposed to Toppin considering the other weapons at hand for the Hornets, multiple 3 shooters, In Rozier and Graham, Stretch four in PJ, Decent shooters off the bench, like McDaniels and Martin and Monk.

I don't know, but it seems like Toppin all around is a boneheaded move. There's not a good reason to draft him unlike someone like Wiseman, and in the realistic situation where that doesn't happen, Okongwu is still a better option and fits the team, much better."
1088,2020-04-15 07:47:06,g1fur2,">Carey‚Äôs strengths supplement Robinson‚Äôs weaknesses, specifically perimeter shooting and being able to throw the ball to him in or around the paint on something other than a lob and look for him to score. 

Carey can't shoot though. All he does is rebound and be big, I don't trust his shooting or passing ability at all. 

I also fully believe that Ball has a lower floor then Hayes on the sheet fact that Ball is a bad defender and bad shooter. That makes his level of current play worse then Hayes who can defend and shoot as well as make plays"
1089,2020-04-16 21:25:41,g1fur2,"I honestly think I talked myself out of putting Toppin to the Cavs in part cause it would‚Äôve been easy to do due to the hometown factor in a sense. That in addition to just not seeing him as the #2 pick. 

Idk, it could be dissected in different ways.  

Wiseman could slip a couple spots and if he were available at the pick I had the Hornets at then it‚Äôs a no-brainer. Yet I don‚Äôt see him getting near where their pick was slotted at in this mock draft, so that‚Äôs pretty much a mute point. 

Its clear to see and understand why you believe Toppin is a janky fit and all around boneheaded move, but believe me I‚Äôve witnessed more questionable selections occur in the draft before.  And again I agree Okongwu would likely be a better fit for them which I stated before. So by all means, stand strong in your beliefs."

1167,2020-05-03 05:28:14,gckx0h,"something to note: while tyler hasn't assigned himself a label, he has confirmed he has an attraction to men, both in his music and in an interview. 

something i'll never get is why people still seem to think they're dating, because it's pretty obvious jaden is joking whenever he says that shit and tyler has repeatedly denied it even on jaden's own song."
1168,2020-05-03 10:18:10,gckx0h,Tyler has staight-up said he is gay. He is just a frequent liar and shit talker so no one took him seriously.
1169,2020-05-03 06:42:46,gckx0h,Maybe I'm out of touch but isn't Jaden like no older than 20 and Tyler is around 30?
1170,2020-05-03 07:57:18,gckx0h,"I have two friends who always joked about dating, switching their status on facebook on April fools day among other things.  They are now married with two kids."
1171,2020-05-03 13:03:16,gckx0h,He isn‚Äôt the one who assigns a label to himself. There is already labels & words for that. He is either gay or if he likes women he is bisexual. That‚Äôs his label.

1173,2020-05-05 05:08:36,gckx0h,A 20 year old should have the mental capacity to give consent.
1174,2020-05-03 10:46:13,gckx0h,so what
1175,2020-05-03 11:02:04,gckx0h,My friend and I kinda-joke about just getting married if neither of us find a wife soon. Neither of us is gay; we just hang out all the time and want someone to split the bills with. Plus it'll be easier to handle stuff if one of us is incapacitated.
1176,2020-06-10 01:50:31,gckx0h,Every joke hold a little truth.. I always find it weird when straight guys take gay jokes with their friends to the next level. I always end up thinking they low-key are in to men foreal.
1177,2020-05-07 20:49:20,gckx0h,Thats commitment to a joke.
1178,2020-05-03 13:38:24,gckx0h,"sexuality aint really that simple bro. the only person who can label someones sexual orientation is themself, really."

1181,2020-05-03 13:03:51,gckx0h,wtf is ‚Äúso what‚Äú dude that‚Äôs like 10-11 age difference lmao
1182,2020-05-03 20:44:22,gckx0h,"I actually have two best friend with whom I have a pact with, similar to this... 
The guy, if we're both 35 with no serious relationship, gonna get married and find a place together.
The girl, if we're 40 and not married, we're just gonna tie it off and see what happens lol.

Like a shotgun marriage with no baby, lol"
1183,2020-05-03 14:57:18,gckx0h,Nope. They can‚Äôt. Someone can‚Äôt label themself as straight if they like men and are a guy. They‚Äôd either be labeled as gay or bisexual. Sexuality is something you obviously don‚Äôt understand.
1184,2020-05-03 13:12:31,gckx0h,"Weirdness really depends on the context and persons involved, here. In some cases it's weird and kinda wrong, but that does not mean you can just flat out judge and shit on every relationship just on that basis."
1185,2020-05-03 16:13:00,gckx0h,"It's not that weird. This isn't uncommon in a lot of LBGT communities.

The pool of people that match your sexual preference is much smaller, and so the odds are slimmer that the person you emotionally connect with best with will be close to your age."
1186,2020-05-03 13:05:38,gckx0h,its not that weird. my parents are ten years apart. my uncle is 65 and has a 22 year old girlfriend cause hes a fucking king
1187,2020-05-03 15:01:01,gckx0h,"on the contrary, yes, they can. it's not up to you, or anyone else besides the person in question. people can label themself whatever they want. sexuality isn't really a black and white thing, man."
1188,2020-05-03 16:15:44,gckx0h,"i mean yeah i can kinda see it i guess.. 10-11 years just seems really extreme, there‚Äôs a huge maturity difference there whether it‚Äôs 10 to 20, 20 to 30, or 30 to 40. being lesbian i‚Äôve managed to date women 1-4 years in my age range"
1189,2020-05-03 15:12:03,gckx0h,You misspelled predator.
1190,2020-05-03 15:41:34,gckx0h,"On the contrary, no, they can‚Äôt. That‚Äôs why there is literal definitions for this thing. Your invalid opinion doesn‚Äôt beat out valid facts."
1191,2020-05-04 05:36:36,gckx0h,"Jaden is 21 and Tyler just turned 29. So 8 years apart, which isn‚Äôt uncommon in the gay community. 

It‚Äôs fine that you date women 1-4 years in your age range but the funny thing about people is that they don‚Äôt have to be like you."
1192,2020-05-03 16:14:05,gckx0h,oh my god stop that üòÇ
1193,2020-05-03 15:44:35,gckx0h,"sexuality isn't really a black and white thing man, it's a bit more complicated than that. but, you do you, keep being close minded i suppose."
1194,2020-10-28 07:29:24,gckx0h,"If you like both men and women your bisexual, nothing complicated. You are literally arguing that a woman who has never attracted to men and have 20 lesbian relationships at her hand can calm herself stright because 'open mindedness'?"

1424,2020-04-29 16:06:56,gabt0g,If the Knicks pick Cole Anthony with Killian Hayes on the board I will lose my mind
1425,2020-04-29 15:43:53,gabt0g,"**Jalen Smith**

After a slow start to the season, Smith came on in a big way for the last three months. He finished the season averaging 15 points, 10 rebounds and 2.4 blocks while shooting 36 percent from 3. That‚Äôs a rare set of skills. How rare? Well, Smith and Daniel Oturu are the only two high-major players in the last three decades to do it, and they both did it this year.
That makes him a fascinating fit for the modern NBA. It‚Äôs hard to find floor spacers who can also shoot it. Those are the kind of players, typically, that tend to give general managers roster-building versatility, because they knock out two essential skills in the frontcourt. Particularly for the Knicks, he would mesh well with what they‚Äôve valued in the past, and the young roster they have. How much does that change with Leon Rose in charge? That remains to be seen.
Now, there are a couple of concerns. First, is he something of a tweener ‚Äî between the 4 and the 5? I buy him more as a rim protector than I did earlier this season, but I‚Äôm unclear if that‚Äôs going to hold up at the next level. Additionally, he‚Äôs also quite stiff, which could lead to him being a bit of a liability in space. Particularly, college coaching sources who played Maryland this season thought that they could move Smith around underneath the hoop a bit due to his higher center of gravity. He needs to get with a trainer and figure out how to get bend throughout his lower half and torso. But right now, I buy into him as a borderline first-round prospect, especially if you think you can develop his ball skills a bit more and make him a 4 man. Given Smith‚Äôs improvement this year, I get taking a flier on him."
1426,2020-04-29 15:42:59,gabt0g,"**Cole Anthony**

Anthony‚Äôs season was obviously a roller coaster, one that was held back by his North Carolina team‚Äôs lack of talent and by its lack of fit together. On the surface, his numbers don‚Äôt look awesome. He posted just a 50.1 true-shooting percentage, turned it over 3.5 times per game and really just struggled to get anywhere because of the lack of space provided to him by North Carolina‚Äôs anemic perimeter attack. Every time he drove, he was surrounded by three guys. That hindered him as a finisher inside, and it cut down an awful lot of passing angles. But, he also seemed to get tunnel vision and missed some easier looks you‚Äôd expect a top-10 pick to make, too. It was really just not a great year for Anthony. And yet, there were also some real flashes.


He hit 35 percent of his 3s despite extremely difficult shot selection. He still averaged 18.5 points, 5.7 rebounds and four assists per game, which is a stat line that only 15 high-major players over the last three decades have hit. Despite imperfect circumstances, Anthony was still a good player this year, which I think has gotten lost in the discussion about UNC and his season. And teams that look further back in his history will find that he‚Äôs been good prior to this year, too. His passing skills showed up well at lower levels in events such as Nike Basketball Academy, Nike Hoop Summit and McDonald‚Äôs All-American practices, when he was surrounded by better teammates.


The Knicks badly need a long-term answer at point guard. Frank Ntilikina is an NBA player and is useful, but he‚Äôs a secondary ballhandler who is an elite defender, not a primary creator. At the very least, Anthony can create shots for himself and has the potential to develop into a nice passer based off of the vision he showed at lower levels. There would be some concern about pairing the ball dominance of both him and R.J. Barrett together, but as someone who buys more into Anthony‚Äôs passing than the consensus, I‚Äôd be okay with it. Anthony‚Äôs range is considered somewhere from No. 5 to the end of the lottery."
1427,2020-04-29 17:11:25,gabt0g,"Would rather have Hayes if both are on the board that late, more of a well rounded player imo"
1428,2020-04-29 17:34:24,gabt0g,I hope we trade up for LaMelo if we fall that far
1429,2020-04-29 15:52:36,gabt0g,If cole Anthony is anything like his dad he‚Äôs gonna let a lot of knicks fans down
1430,2020-04-29 16:15:32,gabt0g,Overall it's a good mock imo. I I would still take Hayes if he's available at 8 tho.
1431,2020-04-29 15:44:53,gabt0g,"Cole/Jalen would be really solid, maybe a Desmond Bane/Bolmaro with the Hornets pick?

EDIT: If KLJ is rising that fast, I feel like a trade down to 10-12 would be really good for us."
1432,2020-04-29 17:06:53,gabt0g,The only good thing about picking Cole over Killian Hayes is the fit with RJ. His shooting will translate imo but his play style will take the ball out of RJs hands.
1433,2020-04-29 16:06:20,gabt0g,why have i heard nothing about the lottery?
1434,2020-04-29 16:11:53,gabt0g,Him having the Knicks pick 8th isn‚Äôt sitting well with me and my ancestors.
1435,2020-04-29 18:37:57,gabt0g,Jalen Smith with the clips pick is very good
1436,2020-04-29 16:22:29,gabt0g,In this instance we'd get the 8th pick and still possibly pass on the best player in the draft lol. Killian Hayes going one pick after us would just be the next one on a long list.
1437,2020-04-29 16:44:47,gabt0g,It would make a lot of sense really. Rose trying to get some excitement in the garden and picking someone who wants to score just fits.
1438,2020-04-29 15:53:52,gabt0g,DSJ averaged 18/6/4 in a high major conference at a younger age. But 6 assists and 4 rebounds a lil diff from cole I guess. I wonder who other 15 players are
1439,2020-04-29 17:50:21,gabt0g,If we fall that far I'd trade down for Kira
1440,2020-04-29 15:49:03,gabt0g,"I didn't follow KLJ but after reading up and watching highlights (yea I know not the best way to get to know a player) I really like him. He is 6'3 with a 6'5 wingspan, blazing fast, seems right hand dominant tho, can shoot in catch and shoot situations and off the dribble. Seems like a good not great passer.

I wouldn't mind grabbing him at all"
1441,2020-04-29 17:27:15,gabt0g,"I disagree with this completely. Hayes has far more value off ball than Anthony. Also, RJ likes a more european style of play."
1442,2020-04-29 17:09:04,gabt0g,"If we decide to run a Cole Anthony / RJ Barrett backcourt we'll be bottom 5 in assists for the upcoming 6 years, while everyone here will keep blaming the coach for it. Book it. It's inevitable. 

Not having a natural playmaker in our backcourt is going to fuck us endlessly."
1443,2020-04-29 16:05:06,gabt0g,"There's a difference between Cole and DSJ though. Cole has a much higher motor and is active on defense.

And this is an opinion not fact but Cole may have been a bit more efficient and had a better stat line if he played when DSJ played. 

When DSJ played the 3 point line was 20.9 feet. This year they moved the 3 point line back to 22.25 feet."
1444,2020-04-29 17:36:18,gabt0g,I would prefer Hayes personally but I think offensively Cole would be a better fit off the ball. His shooting will translate very well in the nba.
1445,2020-04-29 17:45:54,gabt0g,Just curious why you think Hayes will be more valuable off the ball?
1446,2020-04-29 19:58:45,gabt0g,"Not saying it is the right move, it just makes sense in the context that it could happen. I'd definitely would take killian over cole, but you could see how people would be up in arms that we picked another euro project. That is just what the fanbase does... Do we think Rose is ready to take that battle already?"
1447,2020-04-29 22:51:47,gabt0g,Cole Anthony is DSJ 2.0
1448,2020-04-29 20:54:04,gabt0g,"Exactly....

Cole Anthony doesn't have playmaking skills or great vision. He doesn't make his teammates better and he has lower ceiling than Hayes.

There is no way we pick Anthony over Hayes."
1449,2020-04-30 00:48:10,gabt0g,"RJ is actually a good playmaker he needs to be allowed to let that show. We should just move him to the PG and not be so obsessed with getting a PG unless they have all star talent that‚Äôs readily apparent. There is a lot of solid talent, especially shooters that can be taken if we fall that low. I want an exciting PG don‚Äôt get me wrong, but that high we need talent not fit."
1450,2020-05-15 03:19:12,gabt0g,"RJ will be the primary playmaker aka this team's point guard 

He has shown that he has great vision when given the chance"
1451,2020-04-29 16:17:19,gabt0g,"DSJ averaged about 2 steals a game. Not saying steals are everything. Cole is a solid on ball defender and quick on his feet. He does look pretty much peaked physically tho since he looks the same since hs. He also doesn‚Äôt project to be switchable. He doesn‚Äôt have the Lowry/Chris Paul fire hydrant unmovability on switches. So we got a solid on ball defender and rebounder, but he can‚Äôt switch and he‚Äôs not necessarily elite on ball. There are great guards who are as good or worse defensively, but those guys are way more efficient and playmake at a way higher level."
1452,2020-04-30 00:43:00,gabt0g,We‚Äôre the NY Knicks...... we tend to gamble and lose

1454,2020-04-29 17:20:08,gabnku,"1) As a Wolves fan, I'd be really happy with this draft. 

2) I can't see the Wolves FO taking Okongwu. I think he's a great fit next to KAT, but the team seems pretty set on going with a big SF at the PF position (e.g. Covington at the 4 before he was traded). The team seems to really value perimeter shooting and perimeter defense/switchability at the position."
1455,2020-04-29 17:39:31,gabnku,"This was part of his explanation for Tyler Bey: ""Defensively, he won the Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year award, but it‚Äôs pretty clear that was just a numbers-based accolade. The tape tells the story of a gambler who doesn‚Äôt always hold up on-ball.""

Does anyone actually agree with this? I've watched a lot of his tape and concluded the opposite..."
1456,2020-04-30 00:03:24,gabnku,Can you post the explanation for Okongwu to the Wolves? I love the idea of drafting a defensive stud 4 to play next to KAT but from what i'd heard he's more of a 5 offensively and I find it hard to believe Rosas would pick someone who cant shoot at that position so high.

1458,2020-04-29 17:24:49,gabnku,I would guess the Wizards would take Haliburton or Vassel and maybe even Bey over Hayes. So I'm confused about that.
1459,2020-04-29 17:19:36,gabnku,"Would be an interesting, high-risk/high reward, draft for the Celtics, but I think I'd rather they trade out/up if it's gonna go this way."
1460,2020-04-29 19:50:05,gabnku,I'm surprised Terry fell that far. I get that he's super skinny and would get killed on defense right now but his shot is absolute money. Reminds me a lot of lou Williams in terms of his shot creation ability and body. Not sure he can reach Lou's scoring prowess but I think he's a better spot up shooter and passer than Lou. As a Sixers fan I'd be mad if we passed on him at 22.
1461,2020-04-29 23:58:29,gabnku,If the Raptors take Isaiah Stewart over Xavier Tillman or Paul Reed I think I would gag.
1462,2020-04-29 15:35:52,gabnku,can i get the explanation on the Kira Lewis Jr pick?
1463,2020-04-29 17:30:46,gabnku,"Who wrote this, Sam Vecenie?"
1464,2020-04-29 19:12:07,gabnku,May I please have an explanation for the RJ Hampton pick? Seems low
1465,2020-04-30 01:56:00,gabnku,"Okongwu and Bey would really clean up the Wolves‚Äô lack of defense. O would be the only one in our starting lineup who can‚Äôt spread the floor, and even then he has a mid and will develop a three. This draft would be ideal if we don‚Äôt get Edwards"
1466,2020-04-29 16:00:13,gabnku,"Said Hes heard a combination of Edwards, Wiseman, Ball, Advija and Toppin as potentil #1 picks. Edwards is name heard most often when talking to his NBA sources about the #1 pick. He also said that Lamelo isnt a lock for a top 5 pick."
1467,2020-04-29 22:32:34,gabnku,Pok and Terry are 2 of the guys I hope we target but I really don‚Äôt want Achiuwa.  Don‚Äôt really see what he does to maximize the young core moving forward and he doesn‚Äôt help us win playoff games now so it would be kind of a waste
1468,2020-04-30 19:34:47,gabnku,Portland taking Maxey makes zero sense to me. It would be a total reach and he‚Äôs a guard. We desperately need young wings. If Saddiq Bey is there that‚Äôs the logical pick to me.
1469,2020-04-30 01:06:54,gabnku,If Hayes is available I'd prefer it they take him over Anthony due to better defensive versatility.  Love the Jalen Smith pick though.  Could be a sleeper in the draft.
1470,2020-04-30 02:13:24,gabnku,"I'm glad he has Kira Lewis Jr in the lottery

I have Lewis to the Suns in my mock draft (at pick ten)"

1478,2020-04-29 17:26:35,gabnku,Maybe Deni?
1479,2020-04-30 01:03:50,gabnku,"I like Okongwu but I just don't see the fit with Towns. It negates the spacing that comes with having the best shooting big of all time.. 
  
  
Tbh I'd much rather offer #4 for Isaac than take Okongwu"
1480,2020-04-29 23:01:12,gabnku,"He also said his 3 point % is only high because teams don‚Äôt guard him out there, but the issue with Bey was that he was too reluctant of a shooter and should‚Äôve shot even more, he showed some real potential to shoot off movement. Feels like Sam is missing the boat completely"
1481,2020-04-30 00:34:14,gabnku,Felt like Okongwu deserved the award but he didn‚Äôt even make an All-Defense team in the pac12
1482,2020-04-30 14:40:37,gabnku,Sam has been inexplicably brutally low on Bey all year
1483,2020-04-30 15:42:00,gabnku,"FWIW Ringer‚Äôs Big Board has Bey 19, Tyrell Terry who they have here at 30 number at 9. There‚Äôs going to be a huge variance after the top 5 on opinions"
1484,2020-04-30 01:12:38,gabnku,"This is a bit high, but it‚Äôs a good fit. I‚Äôd peg Okongwu‚Äôs draft range from here down to about 12 at this early stage. He was one of the most productive freshmen in college basketball. He averaged 16.2 points and 8.6 rebounds this past season while also being paired next to a true center in Nick Rakocevic. It wasn‚Äôt the most optimal situation for Okongwu to produce, as he didn‚Äôt always have space to operate. But he dominated anyway. 

Generally, the role here is going to be rim-running center who can both finish lobs above the rim and can short roll and take a couple of dribbles prior to finishing.
And that‚Äôs before we get to the defense. He‚Äôs a 6-9 center who can protect the rim because of his strength and length. At 245 pounds, he holds his ground with verticality well. He finished in the top 20 nationally in block rate, and USC was consistently much better as a rim protection team when he was on the floor. On top of that, he can also sit down and slide on the perimeter with opposing guards due to his flexibility and lateral quickness.


The big question teams have, though, is whether you can play him full-time at the 5 given his size? Can he maintain that terrific rim protection at the NBA level, given that he‚Äôs not a behemoth in terms of height? Here, I‚Äôve got him going to Minnesota. Why? The Timberwolves have consistently struggled defensively in the Karl-Anthony Towns era. 

The time where they‚Äôve had the most success on that end is when they paired Towns with Taj Gibson and allowed Gibson to clean up the errors on the backline when Towns got pulled away from the rim. And that‚Äôs going to happen often with this core, as the team has decided to build around the pairing of Towns and D‚ÄôAngelo Russell. Late in games, I‚Äôd anticipate nearly every team just running 50 ball-screen actions at that pairing and forcing them to defend. I think it‚Äôs going to be necessary for them to have someone on the back line to clean that up, and someone who can help Towns when he goes through his inattentive weak-side spells. Towns is great, now the Wolves just need to build around him and insulate his weaknesses."
1485,2020-04-29 19:24:51,gabnku,Hopefully Sarver doesnt go Arizona again
1486,2020-04-29 17:55:06,gabnku,I think the wizards are confident wall will come back well
1487,2020-04-29 22:32:16,gabnku,"Hayes is BPA at that spot. In the top 10 you always draft BPA, not fit"
1488,2020-04-30 03:11:16,gabnku,"Most definitely Hayes, Sheppard loves Euro guys"
1489,2020-04-29 17:47:51,gabnku,"I'd rather they take Hampton if he is on the board, I do like the draft and stash pick towards the end of the draft. I've been reading a lot of good think about Pokusevski"
1490,2020-04-30 16:22:00,gabnku,"Yea I think Stewart is getting the Nico Mannion treatment, I really don't see it."
1491,2020-04-29 15:39:34,gabnku,"As I wrote last week, the more evaluators dig into the tape and look into Lewis‚Äô profile, the more impressed they are. He averaged 18.5 points, 4.9 rebounds and 5.2 assists per game with 1.8 steals on the other end of the floor. He also hit 36.6 percent of his 3-point attempts for the second-straight season. That makes him one of three high-major players in the last three decades to hit those numbers. And since 2010-11, no high-major players have hit those numbers. Among the six mid-major guys to do it, four played in the NBA. So simply put, being able to produce across the board in this many categories tends to portend an NBA career. Oh yeah, and he did it while playing his entire sophomore season at 18 years old after enrolling in college early while also possessing a plus-four wingspan at nearly 6-7? The track record of guys this young to be this good is extremely strong at the next level.


And on the scouting side, Lewis made strides this year in the way that he diagnoses defenses in the halfcourt and chooses to attack. He became a better pick-and-roll distributor and passer, showcasing impressive cross-corner kick-out passes and live-dribble, one-handed reads. Add that to the fact that Lewis might be the fastest player in college basketball ‚Äî who led Alabama‚Äôs uptempo attack in coach Nate Oats‚Äô first season ‚Äî and you have all the ingredients for a draft riser. The questions here largely center on his body and strength. He‚Äôs about 170 pounds and has a very skinny frame that might not necessarily put on a ton of weight long-term. That could hinder him as a finisher, and could hinder his ballhandling ability a bit if guys get physical with him on the perimeter. But for the Pelicans, who have Jrue Holiday‚Äôs free agency to potentially deal with in the summer of 2021, it would make sense for them to invest in another creative lead guard to develop ‚Äî especially given how loaded their roster is with young depth."
1492,2020-04-29 17:51:08,gabnku,"Yup, how'd you know"
1493,2020-04-29 19:51:47,gabnku,"Hampton got hurt and shut things down in the NBL in January. It was encouraging that he held down a rotation spot on a pro team this year, but it wasn‚Äôt quite the wild success that many had hoped.¬†I recently went deeper on Hampton, and explained why teams are struggling to reconcile his tape against other elite guards in this draft. The struggles shooting and the lack of success on defense, particularly, are the issues at play.
In general, I think the draft range is a bit wider on Hampton than what people think. It‚Äôs not impossible a team falls in love with the tools and takes him in the back half of the lottery. But it‚Äôs also a pretty real possibility he takes a bit of a tumble into the latter portion of the teens based on the feedback I‚Äôm getting after he averaged nine points and four rebounds per game in Australia with a 48.8 true-shooting percentage.
In terms of the role, the idea for Hampton is to be a solid combo guard who can switch between the 1 and the 2, given that his handle is pretty polished and his pull-up game has potential. But his jumper needs to be good for that to work in actuality, and it was terrible this season in Australia.


If I were the Mavericks and this is the way the board fell, I‚Äôd probably look more at the trade market. But Hampton does make a modicum of sense for them if they think he will keep getting better. They could use a bigger, secondary ballhandler next to Luka Doncic. Hampton does have good burst athletically, and has the potential to break down defenses. But yeah, the start to his pro career wasn‚Äôt completely ideal, and the way the board fell doesn‚Äôt totally work for what the Mavericks need."
1494,2020-04-30 15:08:29,gabnku, Very interesting. Thx.
1495,2020-04-30 18:59:36,gabnku,Spurs need shooting at the wing spot to support DeMar and Aldridge so they'll get the best 3-D guy available
1496,2020-04-30 23:11:56,gabnku,90 day free subscription is available
1497,2020-05-01 18:28:01,gabnku,"Maxey remains one of the most polarizing draft prospects of this cycle. Some teams have him as a top-10 guy, whereas others have him clearly outside of the lottery. I‚Äôve even talked to some evaluators who have him in the 20s. It‚Äôs somewhat easy to see why. His college performance was not particularly elite in terms of consistency. He‚Äôs not a monster athlete in terms of quickness and explosiveness and he won‚Äôt really break down guys off the bounce with ease at the next level. And as a shooter, Maxey hit just 29 percent from 3 despite developing his jump shot at a high level in high school and turning into a real shooter.¬†Earlier this week, I delved deeper into why I think the shooting is the swing skill for Maxey‚Äôs draft stock. If you buy into the high school numbers, you‚Äôre probably going to be a bit higher. If you‚Äôre more skeptical about the low release point, then you‚Äôre going to be lower on him.

There are some real positives, though. His in-between game is terrific, as he possesses a killer floater package and repertoire. Defensively, he‚Äôs a monster on-ball because he‚Äôs tenacious and built like a free safety. Plus, he‚Äôs also known to be a terrific kid who is hyper intelligent, a hard worker and a great locker room presence. A lot of those skills are actually things that the Blazers value. They tend to select younger players in the draft because the organizational philosophy is that it‚Äôs unlikely rookies can contribute early on, and therefore they should just take the highest upside players. In fact, they haven‚Äôt taken anyone over 20 years old since 2016. Maxey does have upside as a scorer, he fits their scheme, and he‚Äôs the type of defensive presence they could use in the backcourt next to Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum."
1498,2020-04-29 18:55:36,gabnku,Jaden McDaniels has a great mentor in Giannis. Jaden is low floor high cieling prospect just like G. I like it for his development as a player.
1499,2020-04-30 18:53:30,gabnku,"Anthony‚Äôs season was obviously a roller coaster, one that was held back by his North Carolina team‚Äôs lack of talent and by its lack of fit together. On the surface, his numbers don‚Äôt look awesome. He posted just a 50.1 true-shooting percentage, turned it over 3.5 times per game and really just struggled to get anywhere because of the lack of space provided to him by North Carolina‚Äôs anemic perimeter attack. Every time he drove, he was surrounded by three guys. That hindered him as a finisher inside, and it cut down an awful lot of passing angles. But, he also seemed to get tunnel vision and missed some easier looks you‚Äôd expect a top-10 pick to make, too. It was really just not a great year for Anthony. And yet, there were also some real flashes.


He hit 35 percent of his 3s despite extremely difficult shot selection. He still averaged 18.5 points, 5.7 rebounds and four assists per game, which is a stat line that only 15 high-major players over the last three decades have hit. Despite imperfect circumstances, Anthony was still a good player this year, which I think has gotten lost in the discussion about UNC and his season. And teams that look further back in his history will find that he‚Äôs been good prior to this year, too. His passing skills showed up well at lower levels in events such as Nike Basketball Academy, Nike Hoop Summit and McDonald‚Äôs All-American practices, when he was surrounded by better teammates.


The Knicks badly need a long-term answer at point guard. Frank Ntilikina is an NBA player and is useful, but he‚Äôs a secondary ballhandler who is an elite defender, not a primary creator. At the very least, Anthony can create shots for himself and has the potential to develop into a nice passer based off of the vision he showed at lower levels. There would be some concern about pairing the ball dominance of both him and R.J. Barrett together, but as someone who buys more into Anthony‚Äôs passing than the consensus, I‚Äôd be okay with it. Anthony‚Äôs range is considered somewhere from No. 5 to the end of the lottery."
1500,2020-04-30 03:08:00,gabnku,there is an argument Wiseman is the bpa at 1.
1501,2020-04-29 21:39:42,gabnku,Because BPA is based on who is making the selection. Wiseman could be the best player available according to Mitch.
1502,2020-04-30 18:56:41,gabnku,"McDaniels is a particularly difficult guy to slot on the mock right now. After a rough season that resulted in a disappointing result for Washington, McDaniels has teams trying to get a handle on how to assess his mentality and more. At times, he showcased tremendous defensive effort and versatility. At others, he looked aloof and not interested in defending. Then there were intermittent flashes of immaturity and emotion, resulting in six technical fouls and poor body language on the court. He also fouled out a somewhat astounding eight times while playing on the wing (over one-quarter of his games played), while also not really displaying a high-level feel for the game. He had a strongly negative assist-to-turnover ratio, and those turnovers don‚Äôt even account for the shot selection-based mistakes that result in the same outcome as turnovers.


In addition, his overall play in the Pac-12 raised an awful lot of alarms. He averaged 11.8 points per game over Washington‚Äôs final 20 of the season, shooting just 37.6 percent from the field and 32.2 percent from 3. That along with his inconsistency resulted in him being removed from the starting lineup for basically the last 10 games of the year. Also, as you‚Äôll see momentarily in contrast to Isaiah Stewart, it probably doesn‚Äôt speak particularly well of McDaniels that Washington was basically the same team with or without him on the floor in terms of results.


I‚Äôm not all that interested in advocating McDaniels as a first-round pick. Still, the feedback I‚Äôm getting is that someone is likely to select him somewhere in the first round. His talent level is really high for a 6-foot-10 guy who can handle the ball, defend on the perimeter and shoot it. He needs to get to the point where he‚Äôs actually good at those skills, as opposed to being good at those skills for someone his size. If he gets there, he‚Äôs going to be a steal."
1503,2020-04-29 17:33:04,gabnku,"He'd also make sense, and I saw a rumor a while ago from one of the local beat writers that the team likes him."
1504,2020-05-01 16:51:35,gabnku,Probably the best bet imo. Wolves have been all over him
1505,2020-05-01 01:42:38,gabnku,"If you're talking about Jon Isaac then be a little bit realistic, I don't see a situation where Orlando trades Isaac for #4. He is too, too valuable of a piece for that organisation going forward. Kid genuinely has DPOY capabilities and you don't give that away for a chance of something similar at #4, especially in a generally weak class"
1506,2020-05-01 02:55:36,gabnku,Wow.. he wasn't even honorable mention.. wtf?
1507,2020-04-30 17:15:18,gabnku,"Koc is one of the worst draft guys in media. Vecenie is doing this mock based on what he is hearing, not based on what he thinks of guys."
1508,2020-04-29 22:21:55,gabnku,"So, you can still draft his back-up/potential future"
1509,2020-04-29 22:56:36,gabnku,Agree but I think the Wizards are looking for BPA over the next 2-3 years. Hayes will likely need more than that amount of time to develop into a useful player.
1510,2020-04-30 03:01:45,gabnku,"This is generally true, but what about in a draft where everyone sucks?"
1511,2020-04-29 23:50:29,gabnku,"No interest in Hampton.    With three picks one has to be a draft and stash.   For the other two I would prioritize shooting whether a wing or a guard, and a big with either elite defensive potential or stretch."
1512,2020-04-30 16:50:14,gabnku,"I've read/heard a couple of tidbits from those ""in the know"" that Stewart has some untapped shooting potential that's been mostly displayed in practices (plus his FT% is good), so it's not the absolute worst idea to take him, BUT I find that Tillman and Reed are such complete defensive players (and in Tillman's case he can contribute as a passer too) that I would not want to take any bigs ahead of them as a Raptors fan. I think Nurse would love to be able to coach them and immediately insert them into his system."
1513,2020-04-29 19:53:16,gabnku,Thanks!
1514,2020-05-01 20:41:05,gabnku,Thank you kindly!
1515,2020-04-29 19:10:24,gabnku,Jaden McDaniels just sucks imo. I think his ceiling is as high as Kevin Knox(nba). Not great. I don't understand how he is projected to go in the first round.
1516,2020-04-30 01:20:48,gabnku,If you are picking him over about 5 of the players below him then you‚Äôre not picking The BPA
1517,2020-04-30 18:59:33,gabnku,He sounds like Robert Williams or what was being said about him during his draft.
1518,2020-04-29 21:09:17,gabnku,Noo i want the Spurs to get him
1519,2020-05-01 14:36:25,gabnku,"It was just an idea, they could always throw something else in if needed.
  
 
That said, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that unrealistic due to the amount of injuries he‚Äôs had, and that Orlando has so little offensive talent and thats not gonna improve with the 15th pick every year"
1520,2020-04-30 18:11:22,gabnku,"True, didn't know that that was his reputation?  I like the KOC's, the Chad Ford's, Fran Fraschilla's. Obviously insiders are great too, I love comparing what teams are saying versus what are observers saying"
1521,2020-04-30 00:08:58,gabnku,"Well the GM said this .. food for thought 

> ""I think when you look at our roster and you see eight players 23 or younger, we can probably take a swing at somebody and they're not going to have to help us immediately next year. If that player is there, certainly we do that,"" Sheppard said."
1522,2020-04-30 17:17:49,gabnku,Disagree. Hayes is not a project player at all.
1523,2020-04-30 04:43:03,gabnku,Its def not an easy class to project but there are always prospects who have great work ethic and find a way to thrive at the next level. This year teams will have to do more background research than usual on character/intangibles..
1524,2020-04-30 00:17:29,gabnku,"Hampton is the classic Ainge pick, and like our past drafts he usually goes for the highest upside with his first pick. Plus he has experience playing with the ball in his hand, is an able defender, and can switch to guard multiple positions.

You should have no problem with Pokusevski as he is going to be a solid NBA big for the modern game. If the Celtics could somehow land him it would be fantastic, I would even burn the earlier pick for him."
1525,2020-04-30 17:13:42,gabnku,He is definitely a unique prospect but I just don't think he makes sense as a modern power forward and if he's at center he just seems like a worse version of Vernon Carey.
1526,2020-04-29 22:07:16,gabnku,"I see it. McDaniels upside might hit 1/10 times, but when you hit once you have potential to rebuild into a dynasty. Plus, Bucks are stacked as fuck. Bucks are not getting a rotation player for the first rounder.

He's a 99 potential guy, wrapped up in a 60 package."
1527,2020-04-29 19:23:59,gabnku,He's 6'10 with a decent shooting stroke and a ton of athleticism... How could you not see high ceiling there?
1528,2020-04-29 21:38:14,gabnku,"> Jaden McDaniels just sucks imo. 

So did Giannis when the bucks drafted him. Thats  not to say he is the next Giannis but that you arent drafting a player for the player he is today."
1529,2020-04-30 00:06:11,gabnku,"i‚Äôm right there with you, i wouldn‚Äôt even draft McDaniels. he‚Äôs so basic as a basketball player and he‚Äôs really not that good of an athlete imo"
1530,2020-04-30 17:05:42,gabnku,Everybody's read on this year is different. There is no consensus.
1531,2020-05-01 01:45:07,gabnku,People and FO's have different opinions and big boards. There's not a consenus
1532,2020-05-02 02:13:46,gabnku,Orlando GM and President love him he was averaging 2.5 bpg and 1.4 spg before getting hurt AG would be the one to get traded he has been on the trade block past 2 yrs.
1533,2020-04-30 01:18:50,gabnku,Whoa! I did not hear/see this quote. Very interesting. Makes me wonder if Sheppard is thinking about a post Wall/Beal era.
1534,2020-05-01 13:50:32,gabnku,"Imo this draft is bad/unpredictable enough that teams should go with fit. I'm usually BPA on the way, but it is just impossible to guess which of these guys is going to make that leap‚Äîa couple will, but I feel like if there are 3 eventual AS players they're going to be drafted like 4th, 18th, and 47th or something. 

An example of what I'm saying is that I think if GSW has the #1 pick they should draft Ball, who fits their scheme really well and could improve the most in their system. I don't think he's the BPA at #1 necessarily, but I also don't have enough confidence in say Edwards or whoever to spend a pick on whatever miniscule amount of AS equity they have. I've really never thought this before, but man this draft is baaaad"
1535,2020-04-29 19:54:34,gabnku,This actually sounds like what we said about Knox pre draft
1536,2020-04-29 19:42:14,gabnku,"I don't trust his shot,  6'10"" doesn't matter if you can't use it. And his frame doesn't look like it can ""fill out"". He also is just a bad basketball player. Lacks fundamentals"
1537,2020-04-30 00:07:32,gabnku,"Giannis is the exception not the rule

what about Tyrus Thomas? Anthony Randolph? Jan Vessely?"
1538,2020-04-29 22:20:31,gabnku,"Giannis is a freak physically.  Mcdaniels won't grow into that and even if he did, he wouldn't know how to use it.  Jaden McD shot 40 percent from the field in college. Against NBA competition, it's going to be even harder.   High Bust Potential."
1539,2020-04-30 17:04:52,gabnku,I get the knocks on his game for sure but I don't get this athleticism knock. He seems tall strong and a good leaper
1540,2020-04-30 02:20:38,gabnku,Also gotta think about the prospect that could be most desirable in a trade package down the line.. still think there‚Äôs a good chance we try to deal for a Myles Turner or  any good young big who becomes available.
1541,2020-04-29 20:03:37,gabnku,"Knox isn't 6'10, also he doesn't have near the athleticism that McDaniels has."
1542,2020-04-29 20:08:45,gabnku,"You could've said most of that about Giannis when he was drafted, which is more evidence that he'd be a great mentor to help McDaniels reach his potential."
1543,2020-04-29 22:22:46,gabnku,">Giannis is a freak physically. Mcdaniels won't grow into that and even if he did

Jesus christ man, are you going out of your way to miss my point? I even added ""Thats not to say he is the next Giannis"". The point wasnt to expect a giannis like progression, it was not to discount a prospect because he is raw. At the time the Bucks drafted him, Giannis ""just sucked""."
1544,2020-04-30 17:32:51,gabnku,"hate his first step, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs quick enough at all. he took way too many deep 2s for my liking. he‚Äôs definitely long and a decent leaper with alright timing for blocks, but he just feels like Malik Pope to me. it‚Äôs not very functional at this point. saw him power through a good bit of smaller defenders but i think if he would have guys his size guarding him he wouldn‚Äôt look as strong"
1545,2020-04-29 22:35:18,gabnku,"The reason a lot of these ""raw"" guys get good, is due to physical attributes.  Jaden Mcd doesn't have the level of athleticism or feel for him to succeed like other ""raw"" players. Dragan Bender can technically develop into something too."
1546,2020-04-29 22:38:41,gabnku,">Jaden Mcd doesn't have the level of athleticism or feel for him to succeed

Neither did Giannis. The reason he went so late is because no one had a reasonable expectation that he would be a future MVP. Mcdaniels has the on paper attributes to be a top 5 pick. His inconsistency over his freshman year clearly cast a shadow over him and teams are hesitant to bank heavily on his potential. But you are thinking of the wrong prospect if you think a 6'10: sf with a handle and shot creating skills isnt a high ceiling prospect. Right now the major concern is with his floor."

1566,2020-04-26 15:33:09,g8fzg8,"Agreed on Sia, but I really loved Halsey on BWL. Her voice added a lot to the song and it meshed well with Jungkook's imo"
1567,2020-04-26 16:53:39,g8fzg8,"Check out tobi lou and vernon‚Äôs collab! They did a great job, and they‚Äôre also really good friends!"
1568,2020-04-27 11:04:54,g8fzg8,Honestly they wasted Sia's vocals. She has one of the best voices in pop and they gave her like 4 lines and it's frustrating because so many lines of the chorus are in English so she could have easily taken those.
1569,2020-04-26 19:08:02,g8fzg8,"Here are a few other really great English collabs to look into:

1. Don't Need Your Love - NCT Dream x HRVY
2. Look Back At It - Boogie Wit Da Hoodie x Woojin
3. Beside U - Monsta X x Pitbull

The MX one is far better than Who Do U Love. MX has the best English songs in my opinion, but French Montana wasn't it, and I know I was skeptical of Pitbull in Beside U, but he pleasantly surprised me."
1570,2020-04-28 03:02:46,g8fzg8,I was hoping Sia was gonna sing a lot more than that because she has such an amazing voice but when it came out I was disappointed because her voice was just wasted and she sounded a hot mess. But Zara Larson in New Day was good too
1571,2020-04-26 19:11:59,g8fzg8,halsey actually added some flavor and took part in the mv etc sia .........
1572,2020-04-27 14:16:31,g8fzg8,"The one that really surprised me and made me look at her differently was Sia.
Wasnt her image cultivated as a real artists, deliberately not trying to play into hype or image, but then accepting a nothing part in music thats not her style..."

1575,2020-04-26 16:11:08,g8fzg8,Monsta X's English releases are amazing but French Montana's rap was not it.
1576,2020-04-26 16:06:09,g8fzg8,Otra Vez is my jam! Thank you for appreciating it. Haven‚Äôt seen kpop fans mention it anywhere and really makes me sad how a good song isn‚Äôt being noticed.

1578,2020-04-26 15:38:35,g8fzg8,"I agree on the BWL part, and I really LOVE BWL. But my point still stands, yes her adlibs matched well with the vibe and the members. But it felt like it could‚Äôve been ‚Äòmuch more‚Äô or ‚Äòbetter‚Äô. Or improved. But it was already food as it is."
1579,2020-04-26 21:33:43,g8fzg8,Will do!
1580,2020-04-27 11:06:34,g8fzg8,"Right!? Unlike others I actually enjoyed her parts, I think it fit well but she needed more lines or even adlibs. She wasn‚Äôt used well in the song and I think it wasted time tbh"
1581,2020-04-26 21:33:58,g8fzg8,"I‚Äôll check them out later!

Edit: 
I‚Äôm crying these are bops especially the NCT one JDJENDJSNNS. And to be honest I vibed with French Montana, it was good but not really amazing, but it‚Äôs his style of rapping so."
1582,2020-04-26 19:22:14,g8fzg8,"Yeah Halsey added to the BWL vibe, it made the song for sweet in my opinion (Stan Halsey). But taking part of the MV and choreography isn‚Äôt the point of the post to be honest. But it was a big plus with the participation in the choreo, especially considering how Halsey made BWL the way it is with the help of her adlibs. 

But for SIA... There was just her adlibing a part in the chorus. In my opinion it was good, other than that she had NO participation, it‚Äôd be better if she at least had adlib parts throughout the song like Halsey, pitching in some of her adlibs making ON more feel like the MV to be honest, and/or added something unique that distinguishes ON from ON ft. SIA, like IDOL ft. Nicki Minaj, she had her own lines."

I think Monbebes kinda said ""Eff French Montana"" after it became obvious that he wasn't taking the collab seriously. The song is great, just French Montana can eat bricks, lol."
1586,2020-04-26 16:08:48,g8fzg8,because they are old

1588,2020-04-26 16:10:27,g8fzg8,Maybe old but can still sell out most of the groups of newer generations!
1589,2020-04-26 16:09:15,g8fzg8,And? What about it?
1590,2020-04-26 20:57:36,g8fzg8,"kpop is not about music, its about the bling. thats why old groups keep disbanding because there are more and more newer, younger faces."
1591,2020-04-26 20:57:13,g8fzg8,doesnt mean new generation gonna listen to them. they would prefer fan over someone in their teens than someone in their 30s
1592,2020-04-26 20:56:18,g8fzg8,"because the majority of kpop fans are young and they are interested in what is up and coming, records and stuffs"
1593,2020-04-26 21:32:31,g8fzg8,"Fanbase is still there. Sure, new fans or bandwagons come and only follow the trending k-pop groups, thus making new groups blow up faster and bigger. But at the end of the day there‚Äôs still an actual fanbase consisting of old, and new fans. 

And like you mentioned in your other comment, about the 7 year curse, there are still existing groups older than the 7 year mark, it‚Äôs just that not all of them are currently as mainstream as other newer groups. But still, they are still in the game. 

Other than that I agree with your comment. Just not 100%"
1594,2020-04-27 03:37:20,g8fzg8,"No one‚Äôs saying new gen should listen to them. Their own fandom is still quite big enough to give them great sales and that is after 15 years of debuting. 

Also if y‚Äôall would much rather not give idols a  chance because they are in their ‚Äòthirties‚Äô then well you miss out on listening to some of the best vocals in the industry in the form of Kyuhyun, Ryeowook and Yesung and some of the best personalities like Heechul. Not to mention the amazing stage presence and legendary songs they have made till date."
1595,2020-04-26 20:58:44,g8fzg8,Super junior is still releasing songs so why are they not interested?
1596,2020-04-26 22:23:19,g8fzg8,"i just answer the question why new fans dont pay attention to sj. the answer is just... they are old. kpop is so fast moving, there are new fans every year and they dont even care about groups that debut 2 years ago, let alone a decade ago. im taking about gaining new fanbase. 

im a w1 fan, to the kpop world they already non existence, kd still got drag 'omg hes so irrelevant'. its just part of kpop you have to accept, unless there is a heavy promotion or something break out, you have to settle with old fanbase."
1597,2020-04-27 07:24:51,g8fzg8,"the question was why, not should they"
1598,2020-04-26 20:59:43,g8fzg8,"because they are not young anymore. they prefer nct, txt, itzy than a gorup that debut 15 years ago"
1599,2020-04-26 23:51:17,g8fzg8,yes and idk why people are arguing(? maybe not the right word) about this. it's really true when it comes to YOUNG new kpop fans. not saying older groups aren't good or not relevant!
1600,2020-04-26 21:09:58,g8fzg8,So they should stan [4CARART](https://youtu.be/5Cl02UNSrMU) that they are kids then
1601,2020-04-26 21:12:09,g8fzg8,"majority of kpop members are between 18 and 22. kpop groups now debuting as young as 2004. the reason why there is 7 years curse because majority of groups cant compete with new ones, audience move on quickly."
1602,2020-04-26 21:23:34,g8fzg8,"The curse of 7 years is not because of that lol is because most contracts are 7 years contract and most groups are so exploited for those years that they not renew that and a lot of them didn't want to be in a group in the first place, they wanted to be soloist, actors, models etc"
1603,2020-04-26 22:16:41,g8fzg8,the reason they go acting because their idol life is over. no one on the top of their game would quit singing and go acting. you can count on fingers how many groups that last more than 7 years.
1604,2020-04-26 22:22:41,g8fzg8,"Since when you are om kpop honestly? Because it doesn't seem you were here for too long. There are idols that always wanted to be an actor/actress Sulli, Sungyeol Sohee (I.O.I),Yeonwoo, Hyungsik, etc

Nine Muses for example when they were debuted the company said they were a group of MODELS that is why so many members left because they didn't want to be an idol they just agreed to see if they became a little famous and then leave to do what they really wanted to do."
1605,2020-04-26 22:32:53,g8fzg8,like any of them are top idol?
1606,2020-04-26 22:36:35,g8fzg8,"Hyungsik is a top actor and he is a unknown idol how do you feel about that? He became famous acting but debuted as an idol in Ze:A before that and he is still in that group very few people know about it.

MOMOLAND, F(X), I.O.I, INFINITE are they not top groups to you?"
1607,2020-04-26 23:17:46,g8fzg8,"ze:a is a nugu, thats why hyungsik has to go acting. if ze:a is popular you think hyungsik would have go acting?

momoland, fx, ioi, infinite are no longer top group or never a top group. yeonwoo got kick out of the group, momoland had a break out it mean they were a top group, sulli was an actress before became an idol, ioi already disband, infinite is no longer relevant."
1608,2020-04-26 23:18:38,g8fzg8,V is s nugu that is why he acted then
1609,2020-04-26 23:23:04,g8fzg8,yes he was. hwarang was in 2016. bts didnt really break out til may 2017
1610,2020-04-26 23:25:10,g8fzg8,And EXO are nugus too
1611,2020-04-27 00:35:57,g8fzg8,"when is the last time they have proper promotion or attend award show? exo is no longer no 1, members are going military thats why there are solo and stuffs. d.o is an exception because he is a very good actor"
1612,2020-04-27 00:36:37,g8fzg8,IU is a nugu too
1613,2020-04-27 00:39:49,g8fzg8,she is a soloist. shes not that active in singing.
1614,2020-04-27 00:41:42,g8fzg8,you couldnt be more wrong...
1615,2020-04-27 01:01:01,g8fzg8,she doesnt have 3 come backs a year like usual groups
1616,2020-04-27 02:42:53,g8fzg8,"She doesn't need to. She is arguably one of the most famous female vocalists in Korea over the past couple of years and she has large acting credentials to boost. 

Idol groups have multiple comebacks to keep them in the forefront of people's attention. That's why groups like EXO, BTS, TVXQ, etc can have one or two comebacks per year and still sell well because they already HAVE the fanbase. Notice how Twice doesn't have as many comebacks as they used to? They don't need to anymore."
1617,2020-04-27 02:44:56,g8fzg8,thats not the point of argument. idol venture out to acting because idol is no longer their priority/main income. there is no one that making tons of money in idol suddenly quit to act.
1618,2020-04-27 02:48:57,g8fzg8,"Actually a lot of idols become an idol because it is notoriously difficult to go into acting from the start so they use being an idol as a platform for it.

Remember an idol isn't just a singer. It's about being the full package"
1619,2020-04-27 03:05:28,g8fzg8,"again its not the point of argument. old groups dont gain much new fans because fans prefer younger groups. thats why most of groups dont last long, hence they have to start going solo, acting etc. the only top group is still on top of their game now is probably tvxq, the rest are all over places."
1620,2020-04-27 04:47:51,g8fzg8,"I mean I get your overall argument and it does make sense although tbh as of this year, BTS will also be considered as one of those ""Old groups"". I was just pointing out some inaccuracies in your examples.

However, time always moves on and we humans are fickle and want something new and fresh"
1621,2020-04-27 07:26:51,g8fzg8,"bts break out in 2017, it should be more appropriate to count that as their timeline. lets see in 2024 where bts would be"

Yes he looks uncomfortable, but about as uncomfortable as anyone does when their mom tries kiss them on the cheek or something more typical.

But I want to just make everyone aware that the Jazz believe in their core (as do I as a Jazz fan). They are not looking for a Conley replacement. They are not planning to trade Gobert and are not looking for a replacement.

I know this team inside and out. They are looking to supplement what they have. And since they have limited ways to improve financially it's likely they use their draft pick to fill a need. A few things they'll be targeting...

A big wing who can defend big wings. A low offensive usage connective tissue type of guy who help connect the high usage players on the roster and make lineups flow better. Possibly a stretch 5. Athleticism. Defense.

A few guys in particular that I think they'll have their eye on...

Jalen Smith, Aleksej Pokusevski, Precious Achiuwa, Paul Reed, Saddiq Bey, Tyler Bey, Xavier Tillman, Zeke Nnaji. If they go guard then Devon Dotson is a possible target because his play style fits the Jazz scheme so well."

Question: what are you referring to with PatWill‚Äôs  muscle imbalance?"
1668,2020-06-26 02:42:20,hfs60u,Pretty damn close to my ideal Wolves draft though the reasoning for picking Nesmith is a bit weird. After all our midseason trades we were one of the best 3pt shooting teams in the league.
1669,2020-06-25 19:39:09,hfs60u,"As a really big Cavs fan (since the early 90s) I don't like Wiseman at 2, I think you have to take Ball there

The Cavs are too early in the rebuild to start to draft for fit, the Cavs need to take highest ceiling guys till one hits, at which point you build around them for fit"
1670,2020-06-25 19:46:51,hfs60u,I would be annoyed if the Celtics took two draft and stash guys. We did that in 2016 and missed out on better players. Would rather trade up or even trade out.
1671,2020-06-25 21:39:53,hfs60u,"I like Terry a lot, though I do wish his shot off of movement was just a tad quicker. he‚Äôs gonna make the shots he takes but I can see bigger athletes giving him more trouble on those kinds of looks bc he doesn‚Äôt get a great amount of lift on his jumper and he‚Äôs already short. I feel like he‚Äôs gonna rose up boards in the process leading up to the draft. could see him going in Herro‚Äôs range last year"
1672,2020-06-26 00:17:22,hfs60u,"I like this fit at 22. But I think we can go with imo the BPA in Jalen Smith.

I think I would take Elijah hughes at 34.

Like this pick at 36 aswell but I would probably reach for Malachi Flynn.

I think the bpa at 49 would be Abdoulaye N'doye

Damn Wesson would've been my guy at 59 lol. But Yves Pons I would like to put on a Two-Way with this pick.

Also props for putting Saddiq on the Blazers. As a nova fan hope he goes there."
1673,2020-06-26 01:23:06,hfs60u,Yeah...no. No to Isaiah Stewart. Not a good fit for what the Jazz need or how they play.
1674,2020-06-25 22:57:11,hfs60u,"If the Raps take Riller with Tillman, Oturu, Nnaji, and Reed on the board, or take him over the better PGs in Dotson and Jones, man oh man I‚Äôd be pretty upset lol.

In all honesty I think you‚Äôve got our picks backwards. More likely they take a big in the first and then a guard in the second."
1675,2020-06-26 04:39:30,hfs60u,"Not a fan of Ball‚Äôs fit with the Wolves. I‚Äôd prefer several other players at 3.

That said, really appreciate the effort here, this was an enjoyable read"
1676,2020-06-25 22:55:43,hfs60u,"I agree it's low but in all honesty, I'm not sure where else to slot him in. I doubt a team would take him simply because they view him as the ""Best Player Available"", because he needs a fairly specific infrastructure to succeed. I don't think it's crazy for him to fall out of the first round and most of the mocks I've seen lately have had Oturu ahead of him (though I disagree with that personally). Where do you think he should have went?"
1677,2020-06-25 23:10:41,hfs60u,Thank you
1678,2020-06-25 23:10:28,hfs60u,"Thank you. I'm a little concerned about Ramsey's decision-making and very concerned about his defensive IQ, but I can definitely see him going in the first if a team really buys the athleticism and shooting combo (maybe the Knicks at 27?). He's also not a good enough shooter off movement or off the dribble imo to bet on him as a 3pt specialist when Isaiah Joe is right there and is just better at so many things in my view.

Idk if ""imbalance"" is the right word but his legs are like almost too strong lol. He put on a lot of muscle in his legs in the last year or so and I think if he could trim down a little, it might help his lateral mobility. He really isn't a wing currently because I'm not sure if he's a fluid enough mover to guard guys on the perimeter, but if he could improve his lateral movement, he might be able to guard 2-4, and when coupled with his rim protection, he might be an incredible defender."
1679,2020-06-26 00:42:59,hfs60u,"drafting ball is just going to stall everyone‚Äôs development. garland and ball can‚Äôt be on the floor together, zero defense. Sexton needs the ball, KPJ needs the ball. you throw lamelo in there and that‚Äôs another guy who needs the ball and hurts everybody. 

Sexton looked amazing the second half of the year, KPJ is the best kept secret in the league, and garland moves the way an elite point guard moves (very similar to Brandon Ingram. Ingram looked amazing but the ball just wouldn‚Äôt go in). you need to get a guy like wiseman who can play defense bc right now they‚Äôre learning bad habits bc of how bad the team defense. 

lamelo isn‚Äôt that good of a prospect"
1680,2020-06-25 21:17:37,hfs60u,"Wiseman has an insanely high ceiling, arguably higher than Ball."
1681,2020-06-25 23:17:06,hfs60u,"Yeah I agree I definitely went back and forth on it. I would imagine the most likely move for Cleveland if they get #2 is to trade back, which makes sense to me. I think for some, Wiseman is justifiable at 2 because they see him as one of the better big man prospects over the past decade and a potential franchise changer, but I certainly don't view him that way."
1682,2020-06-26 08:48:48,hfs60u,Ball on that team will be a circus a core of 4 guards I‚Äôm sure ball will do everything not to get drafted by the cavs . No offense
1683,2020-06-25 22:59:46,hfs60u,"I would love to trade up as well. Killian Hayes would be my first choice by I'd be ecstatic for Cole Anthony or Tyrese Maxey as well, as we really need bench scoring. But Poku might not be a draft and stash; I think I saw something that he kinda wants to come over immediately, and if you can develop him properly, which I have faith that the Celtics will, you might end up with one of the top players in this draft when it's all said and done. Because the Celtics roster is already fairly well built, they can afford to take a high-upside gamble. And for Bolmaro, getting him at 26 is great value in my view, as I see him as a borderline lotto talent with some of the best upside in the class. These guys aren't Yabusele and Zizic. They have pretty high ceilings."
1684,2020-06-25 23:02:19,hfs60u,"Yeah he could very realistically go higher since that area from the late lotto to the early 20s isn't great in terms of reliable talent. I love the fit with Philly but New Orleans, Dallas, and Milwaukee could also be awesome. I guess in that case if I'm the Sixers I might look at Malachi Flynn at 22, even though that's pretty early for him, as that's also a great fit for their roster."
1685,2020-06-25 23:25:55,hfs60u,"Yeah that makes sense. I figured it's worth it to take the guard there because there's a sizeable drop-off in my view after Riller, Dotson, Mannion, and Jones, whereas you could possibly get a solid big man toward the end of the draft. I like Wesson, but they just as easily could have gone with Simonoviƒá for example, or go small with someone like Pons. If they grab a big in the first, they're probably left with like Pritchard, Powell, and Howard, and just don't think those guys are worth drafting. Also I think Riller is comfortably ahead of both Dotson and Jones. Jones doesn't really do anything special he's just a solid backup who plays good defense. A lot of Dotson's strengths are also Riller's strengths (specifically attacking the rim and finishing), and if anything, Riller is farther along in terms of those strengths and is just more likely to be a good pro."
1686,2020-06-26 13:01:50,hfs60u,"Who would you look at instead? I've seen Toppin to the Wolves a few times and I think that's a terrible fit. They might work offensively, but that is a disastrous defensive frontcourt. They won't be able to guard anyone. I've also seen Okongwu there, but I don't like that fit either. Part of the value of KAT is that he's as skilled as he is offensively for a center; by making him effectively play PF, I think you lose some of the advantages that he creates on the offensive end, plus I'm not sure if either Okongwu or KAT would be maximized defensively playing the 4. So you're basically either reaching for a wing (Deni, Vassell, Okoro) or taking another guard that probably doesn't fit super well with D'Lo, like Hayes. I'd rather just take the upside in Ball and move him later if you really want to."
1687,2020-06-25 22:59:03,hfs60u,"I wrote an essay about him and whenever you ask I can add more. Here you are (from the 3rd Paragraph). Anyway, I would take him between 20-30.

1688,2020-06-26 00:48:20,hfs60u,"There‚Äôs no way we re-sign both sexton and garland

I‚Äôm pretty high on garland too, I think he could play off ball due to his shooting

I think Collin could easily become a top 6th man getting 30 minutes and averaging 20

I think either can play with Ball

I have always loved big playmakers so I could be wrong on ball, what don‚Äôt you like? His form is off but he doesn‚Äôt have lonzo‚Äôs sweep which defenders just sit on and have kept him from shooting well in the nba, his playmaking is Rubio at least, his floater is really good and he can shoot it from outside the lane"
1689,2020-06-25 22:11:33,hfs60u,"I'm really high on Wiseman, I think he can be DeAndre Jordan with a jump shot which IMO would be a HOF level player.

I just think that Ball is more setup for success (depending on measurements big diff from a 6'5 PG and a 6'8 PG imo) as his handle, passing, and floater all set him up for a really great floor and if his jumper comes around (his range is already impressive, just his consistency) he could be a superstar"
1690,2020-06-26 14:31:04,hfs60u,"NBA players don‚Äôt refuse to go to teams, can‚Äôt remember the last time that happened, if he‚Äôs there and the Cavs want him he‚Äôll be a cav 

The Cavs have had the worst record in the league the past two years, you don‚Äôt draft for fit in a terrible team you draft for talent"
1691,2020-06-27 17:53:30,hfs60u,"I'd rather take RJ Hampton than Poku with the MEM pick. He's a project too, but I like his chances of becoming something more than I do Poku, who I don't think will ever be physical enough to play at the NBA level. If he's around at 26 or 30, I'd be less opposed to swinging for him. Bolmaro would be a perfect stash guy for the Cs, but I'd rather take Jalen Smith in that 26 spot. Think he can be like another Theis. If they did go with Bolmaro at 26 though, I'd want Nnaji over Tillman I think. Grant Williams already does what Tillman does, but better. Nnaji has good size, runs the floor really well, and has nice touch. Needs to improve defensively, but Boston would be the perfect system for that. 

Good work on this overall though."
1692,2020-06-25 23:10:37,hfs60u,"Flynn is interesting, would rather wait on him in the 2nd round though. just want a guard that can dribble, pass and shoot. novel concepts for sixers guards"
1693,2020-06-25 23:31:16,hfs60u,"I'm just not a big Riller fan due to his non existent defence and subpar playmaking for a point guard. Dotson and Jones are both superior in those areas and Dotson is similar offensively (I believe he can shoot and that his bad 3 pt % this year is just poor sample size.)

At the end of the 2nd they could also go with Sam Merrill, who while an older guard, can at least fill out the backup PG role with his all around play and good shooting. Or they could just not pick a PG at all and select a wing to back up Anunoby next year. The Raps believe Davis can be a point guard so they may just stay away from that position this year."
1694,2020-06-26 02:45:42,hfs60u,With as much enthusiasm I've seen you have for this guy you could probably make a pretty good post on this sub analyzing him.
1695,2020-06-26 00:50:17,hfs60u,you can‚Äôt possibly know that. they‚Äôre going to resign sexton so that‚Äôs 3 years of them together at least

For all the celebration of Occam's Razor, this is a failure to apply it, because the implications are almost unendurable for the values & presuppositions of the average research scientist. 

Simulation theory seems to me to be remarkably paranoiac. The obvious conclusion of the H experiment is that mind or consciousness are essential to reality, and not simply emergent phenomenon, phenomenona that emerge from biology; mind is ""under"" matter, and what we call Nature is basically God's dream? And what we call human life is, as Shakespeare said, a dream within a dream. That's what I believe.

Destroy Descartes."

1767,2020-06-17 13:58:54,haqsby,"I can, I'll copy paste it:

 Celebrity couple Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith have presumably tried to do what they believe is best for their children. But it‚Äôs fair to say that their parenting techniques have sometimes appeared quirky to the outside world; even Jada‚Äôs mother admitted that at one point she thought their approach was ‚Äúcrazy.‚Äù Despite this, though, the A-lister mom was taken aback when her son, Jaden, came to her with a heartbreaking request. 

 Jada opened up about the particular exchange with Jaden in an episode of her online chat show *Red Table Talk*. During the clip, the mom discusses a conversation that she had with her actor son when he was just 15. And she admits that she was ‚Äúdevastated‚Äù by what he had to say. 

 But despite her heartbreak, Jada did her best to understand Jaden‚Äôs point of view. And in the end, she said that she came around to his way of thinking ‚Äì even though it wasn‚Äôt what she‚Äôd wanted. So using her motherly instincts, Jada proved that if you love someone, you truly should let them go. 

 Judging from their interviews and social media channels, the Smith family share quite a special bond. And while many kids might go out of their way to avoid public appearances with their parents, Jaden and Willow seem to enjoy the company of their mom and dad. And as they‚Äôve grown older, they‚Äôve kept Jada and Will close. 

 For example, by January 2019 Jada and Willow had racked up over 275 million views on their Facebook Watch web series *Red Table Talk*. Thanks to their efforts on the chat show, the mother-daughter have even earned a daytime Emmy nomination. Furthermore, no subject is off-limits on the series ‚Äì revealing Jada and Willow‚Äôs sense of ease with one another. 

 Elsewhere, when Jaden performed to a heaving crowd at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in 2019, he kept things in the family by inviting his dad Will and sister Willow on stage with him. The former‚Äôs performance became one of the standout sets of the event, and to top it off, he had shared the special moment with his family. 

 It‚Äôs fair to say that Jada and Will have been extremely supportive of their children throughout their lives. They have encouraged their offspring to pursue their own passions ‚Äì rather than forcing their own interests on them. 

 Now Jada and Will aren‚Äôt strangers to the parenting game. After all, since tying the knot in 1997, they‚Äôve welcomed two kids together. The couple had their first child, Jaden, back in 1998. And two years later, they added to their brood with a daughter: Willow. Plus, Will has an older son named Trey ‚Äì whom he shares with his first wife Sheree Zampino. 

 Over the years, meanwhile, Will and Jada have become infamous for their somewhat non-traditional approach to parenting their three kids. The celebrity couple have been open about the relaxed view on discipline in their household, for example. And in 2013 Will explained to *Metro*, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt do punishment.‚Äù 

 Will went on, ‚ÄúThe way that we deal with our kids is \[that\] they are responsible for their lives‚Ä¶ Our concept is as young as possible, give them as much control over their lives as possible. And the concept of punishment ‚Äì our experience has been \[that\] it has a little too much of a negative quality.‚Äù 

 To add to that, Will and Jada have apparently encouraged their children to be as open as they can with them. For instance, the couple created a so-called ‚Äúcircle of safety‚Äù when the kids were very young. The thinking behind this was supposedly to allow the family to have honest conversations with one another without fear of judgment. But as we‚Äôll find out, this didn‚Äôt excuse the kids entirely from punishment. 

 You see, during a 2016 appearance on *The Tonight Show*, Will told host Jimmy Fallon, ‚Äú\[In the circle of safety, the kids are\] allowed to tell us everything that they did, and they can‚Äôt get in trouble‚Ä¶ The rule is, if we find out after the circle of safety that there was something you didn‚Äôt say, there was hell to pay.‚Äù 

 Yes, the aforementioned concept certainly sounds good in theory. But as Will and Jada‚Äôs kids grew older, there were some details that their parents began wishing they wouldn‚Äôt share. For example, Will admitted that when Willow became a teenager, he struggled to listen to some of her admissions. 

 On *The Tonight Show*, Will explained, ‚ÄúAs a father, you do not want a circle of safety with a 15-year-old daughter. You do not‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòBaby, you need to start lying!‚Äô‚Äù In fact, Will joked that he had sometimes found this time with Willow so difficult that he‚Äôd had to pass her along to Jada. He confessed, ‚Äú\[I‚Äôm like,\] ‚ÄòNope! You and your mom can talk about that one!‚Äô‚Äù 

 That said, Will can hardly be surprised at his children‚Äôs openness, given that he and Jada have always encouraged self-expression. And that goes for Willow and Jaden‚Äôs unique fashion senses, too. Yet the doting parents have stood by their kids‚Äô clothing choices ‚Äì even when they may have raised some eyebrows. 

 For instance, Jaden has been known to blur conventional gender lines by wearing garments which have traditionally been donned by women. And it seems that Will and Jada couldn‚Äôt be prouder of their son‚Äôs radical approach to fashion. In 2016 Will told BBC Radio 1Xtra, ‚ÄúJaden is 100 percent fearless.‚Äù 

 Will added, ‚Äú\[Jaden\] will do anything. As a parent, it‚Äôs scary; it‚Äôs really terrifying. But he is completely willing to live and die by his artistic decisions, and he doesn‚Äôt concern himself with what people think.‚Äù Furthermore, it appears that Will and Jada fully support their son‚Äôs freedom to express himself, and they believe that this helps him grow as an individual. 

There's a lot more and it keeps going on and on. sorry I gotta stop.

Mumble rappers are mostly four-dimensional-Se users(LSE, ESE, SEE, SLE)

Eventually, we see that rappers are mostly infantiles(infantiles are intuitives that have Ne in the mental ring(first 4 functions). These types are ILE, IEE, LII and EII) and constructivists(types that have ethics as program+restrictive/pain+activation functions). So the most common types among rappers are ILE and EII.

Maybe I'll update the post later :)"
1778,2020-07-23 00:00:41,hab9ad,"No offense but I disagree with a lot of the typings here.. Jaden Smith - IEI, inner abstraction, extremely emotionally expressive, rebel Beta vibe especially ON SYRE, no sense of Te if you look at his infamous Twitter posts it‚Äôs all his own abstract logic - Ni/Ti  , big picture change the world type Beta mindset 

Juice Wrld - Definitely Fe ego likely Fe creative type so SEI or IEI, extremely expressive of his emotional states  

Travis Scott - big dynamic introvert vibes, likely Fe over Te (Rage persons = Fe and Se) xEI type  leaning towards IEI seems abstract overall. Could be SEI though as he‚Äôs very into his aesthetics which is pretty Si

Kanye West - definitely 100% EIE. Very dramatic, demonstrative Ne, Se valuing but not strong, bad Ti very bad at wording his thoughts which gets him in trouble, needs a Ti dom to make his thoughts concise, even worse Si, he is always disrupting the atmosphere instead of flowing with it harmoniously and he is never on chill.  

Drake - SEE ‚Äî his music totally about Se and Fi, always bragging about his objects and how much he has, always rapping about confrontation with his enemies (very Gamma), his emotional songs are always about his relations and who he can and can‚Äôt trust, demonstrative Fe he uses Fe for Fi reasons, always trying to conquer different Cultures all over the world via relations with others, making friends with the Grime scene, paying homage to Houston and making relations with the legends there etc..

Eminem - Fi valuing introvert leaning towards ESI over SLI, a lot of his music about his relations with people in his life and his contempt with who he dislikes, values/prizes technical skill in his rhymes which points to valuing Te

Wiz Khalifa - seems SLI / ISTP in MBTI, more socio Si, very laid back chill type of person not emotionally expressive, seems unbothered by most things at least externally, can tell he has that Fi he has no problem stating his static attitude on a situation

Trippie Redd - don‚Äôt get how you see Fe ignoring and Se PoLR from him. He comes off as very expressive and image oriented and valuing of static objects and is definitely not anti-force like an EII would be. He raps about violence all the time and is not afraid of confrontation (6ix9ine) he‚Äôs at least Se valuing with at least 3D Fe

Lil Yachty is super SEI, he‚Äôs so Alpha Quadra. He‚Äôs a total MBTI ISFP.. laid back, pretty emotional, goofy vibe and humor, very simple kind of guy

T.I. is an LSI. Extremely logical, has strong logical opinions and has no Ne, his opinions are super black and white. Also values force but it‚Äôs guided by his logic and not just for the sake of it. Beta values, radical mindset

Uzi - seems Beta NF, extremely emotionally expressive, definitely values Se/Force, can be dramatic and mysterious in a Ni/Fe way. If not Beta then Gamma SF

Weeknd - I believe he values Fe over Fi, seems very socionics Pi and plays with images and vibes a lot in an Socio Fe way, every album he alters his image and aesthetic. Probably SEI or IEI.

more typing differences 

Hopsin - EIE, I think he has strong Ne but it‚Äôs subservient to his Ni, major Beta vibes challenging stereotypes and trying to influence people mentally 

Beyonc√© - Gamma SF to Jay-Z‚Äôs Gamma NT

Swae Lee from Rae Sremmurd - total SEI

Post Malone - SEI (him and Swae Lee very similar personalities)

ASAP Rocky - don‚Äôt get how he‚Äôs 1D Si or an intuitive, he more seeks Intuition imo Sensory dominant type but not sure which one, most likely either SEI or SEE

Gucci Mane - Se ego type for sure most likely SEE or SLE"
1779,2020-06-23 12:13:48,hab9ad,This couldn‚Äôt be more inaccurate..
1780,2020-07-23 18:32:35,hab9ad,"Jaden isnt an IEI, hes an EII...his focus isnt on what other people care about, and when you listen to his albums you're taken down a chaotic journey into his mind & emotions on everything...this is Prime Fi + Ne. an IEI is J. Cole, notice how he talks about in his music is his relationship and how he feels about the current state of society, social justice issues, etc.. and its not chaotic its clear as day.. Theres 0 way is hell Jaden is an IEI. Not to mention, his super ego is a LSI and ID is a EIE, when he goes dark and he does alot, you'll get those vibes. Im an LII but can give off Gamma vibes easily when you catch me in the right mood.

Juice Wrld - Fi over Fe. Do you even understand what the difference is dude??? You just called two PRIME examples of what Fi is under Fe. Fe isnt the expression of emotional state, its the awareness of others emotional states and values. But its not deeply understood like it is with Fi. Juice understands every inkling emotion he feels and views time through them. Thats what 4D Fi is!

I really wanna respond to the rest of what you said man but you gotta chizzle out your understanding of the functions first dawg lol. This isnt MBTI, welcome to socionics."
1781,2020-06-23 12:33:28,hab9ad,Why are you thinking that my versions are inaccurate?
1782,2020-07-23 19:21:24,hab9ad,"source: https://www.sociotype.com/socionics/information_elements/

Fi: like/dislike, decency and niceness, morals, good/bad, etiquette, humanism, attraction/repulsion, empathy, compassion, attitude towards other human beings, how others are treated, think about other's humanity ""let's hear his side,"" judgements determined by people doing things

Fe: emotions and emotional expression, passion, mood, excitation, exuberance, romanticism, imitation, acting, not a moral arbiter of good/evil, how they are treated as opposed to how others are treated, sympathy, at certain instances disregards other people's humanity in certain situations, judgements are determined by the situation - at things being done


Fe in Socionics (not MBTI) is absolutely the expression of your own internal emotional state in addition to assessing the emotional vibe outside of you. Look at the definitions above. You‚Äôre the one that‚Äôs conflating MBTI and Socionics, not me. 

Taking someone on a chaotic journey of your mind/emotions is Socionics Ni/Fe. It‚Äôs about emotions (Fe) like you said and exploring your internal state of mind is absolutely Socionics Ni. It‚Äôs the Internal Dynamics of Fields. It‚Äôs about being engrossed in your own mental dynamics and mental state. Ne is the Internal Statics of Objects ‚Äî it‚Äôs looking at connections OUTSIDE of yourself. Its about the inner characteristics of outer objects. 

The SYRE album by Jaden isn‚Äôt about morals, good/bad ‚Äî it‚Äôs about him expressing his inner mindset and emotions due to events he‚Äôs been through. 

If anything J Cole fits that Fi description way more. He‚Äôs more of the looking at the other people‚Äôs perspectives (A Tale of 2 Citiez for example)/how others are treated type of rapper. You even said yourself that he raps about his relationships which is the definition of Socionics Fi. 

Socio Fi = Relations   
Socio Fe = Emotions

Now I agree in MBTI Jaden is an NFP for sure and J Cole is NFJ for sure. But the definitions differ in both systems, ESPECIALLY Fe and Fi. That‚Äôs why Kurt Cobain is the poster boy for Fi/Ne (INFP) in MBTI and Ni/Fe (IEI) in Socionics."
1783,2020-06-23 13:26:15,hab9ad,"> Tupac - EII

I don‚Äôt understand Tupac enough to debate you on this.

> J. Cole - EII

As someone that is a J. Cole fan, literally my number one artists, I‚Äôve noticed his music is pure Ni + Fe. When ever he raps, he tells a well constructed story that gives a very piercing insight into the domains of human nature poetically. He barely ever raps about his own emotions directly, but instead chooses to rap about social injustice in the world by painting a very big picture and it‚Äôs usually direct to primarily the black community. He calls for change constantly and is doing everything in his power to do so. This is prime IEI behavior.

> Joey Bada$$- EII

Don‚Äôt understand Joey Bada$$ enough to debate

> Travi$ Scott - irrational introvert. I'd say he's rather tactician than strategist so IEI/ILI

Travis Scott is one of the best performers in the game and his energy is directed outwardly. So it‚Äôs clear as day he is an Se Dom, but I say SEE because oh his documentary look mama I can fly. He‚Äôs all about raging, feeling the energy of crowd (could be mobilizing Fe), and just being an all out performer.

> Kanye West - ILE

IEE. Kanye has a very strong intellect and he see(n)‚Äôs connections between things that others don‚Äôt. He can‚Äôt be an ILE because his Polr Ti is more than obvious, just take his comments about how ‚ÄúSlavery was a choice‚Äù and how he went about explaining it. It was god awfully embarrassing. Not to mention he upsets Fe social values constantly not for the sake to learn more, but because he doesn‚Äôt care it‚Äôs his values over everyone else. 

Not to mention with his music there‚Äôs a lot of reminiscing of his past and how he feels about the things that have happened. ILEs do not reflect on their emotions to the extent Kanye does.

> Kid Cudi - EIE/EII

Kid cudi is known for bringing kids and teens out of depression because he is standing up for his values (Fi). He doesn‚Äôt try to appeal to the masses based on emotions (or really care matter of fact), he‚Äôs doing him and being an individual. EII

> Kendrick Lamar - ESI

 Kendrick..I can‚Äôt debate I‚Äôll be honest I don‚Äôt have a strong conviction yet, but you may be into something xD

> Denzel Curry - ILE

Can‚Äôt debate, don‚Äôt listen but I could 100% see it.

> Vince Staples - LSI/SLE

Can‚Äôt debate, don‚Äôt listen but I could 100% see it.

> Ice Cube - IEE

Can‚Äôt debate, don‚Äôt listen but I could 100% see it.

> Tyler the Creator - ILE

See I thought this at first too but he‚Äôs too intentional about being an ass hat to be an ILE. If an Fi user is an ass or being ignorant it‚Äôs usually for their own enjoyment, ILE‚Äôs do it too for their own enjoyment but eventually return to respecting other people‚Äôs values. Tyler doesn‚Äôt give a shit. I‚Äôd have to say **IEE**

> MF DOOM - ILE/LII(I barely see Se as pain fuction so he's rather ILE than LII)

Can‚Äôt debate, don‚Äôt listen but I could 100% see it.

> Post Malone - SEI

Post Malone‚Äôs music has a ton of Fi in it, but definitely more Ne and than Se. In Stoney he made a song talking about how he belongs in the stars and talks way more about abstract things than concrete. **EII/IEE**

> Snoop Catty Catt - SLI/SEI

Who? üòÇ

> Tyler Joseph - Beta ethical type. I suppose EIE

No clue

> Drake - SEE

Not even close..Drake is literally the poster child for (Dark) ENFJs and just how powerful their Fe can truly be. His music overflows with Fe, like with an INSANE amount of it. 

Drake is so popular today because he knows how to appeal to the masses, makes music that EVERYONE likes, not very individualistic, he figured out how to get maximum social value through his music, and when he gets more introverted on his songs all he ever talks about are his goals(Ni) and the experiences he‚Äôs shared with other people in lifetime (Fe). He always values Se very highly.

But seriously tho drake is a DARK EIE, could be because of his Scorpio ties.

> DMX - ESI/SEE(ESI most probably)

Can‚Äôt debate

> Logic - LIE

Logic is an LII, I say this because of his word play and the way he expresses his self isn‚Äôt aggressive or forceful like an LIE would. Not to mention he‚Äôs super vulnerable with his emotions like all LIIs are.

> Eminem - ESI

 LSI, common man this is widely accepted üòÇ

> Hopsin - LIE/LSE

ILE. Just listen to all his ill minds, that‚Äôs Ne + Ti ripping apart social constructs and values endlessly in a very witty, ass hole, no fucks given manner all to shed the light of truth. That‚Äôs the difference between ILEs and IEE, ILEs are assholes to preserve truth, IEEs are assholes just for their own entertainment.

> JAY-Z - LIE/ILI

4D & 3D, but you‚Äôre correct.

I still think Gamma Sfs and Delta Nfs are majority of rappers :P

Do it"
1784,2020-07-23 22:30:53,hab9ad,"right on for the response. 

lets take into consideration both Jaden and JCole being INF's, that means they both have 4D Fi and Ni. So they both explore the chaos that is their own mind respectfully. How they interact with the outter world is what reveals who they are. Perfect example are their tweets. 

Remember the out there tweets jaden use to share? Yeah thats Ne, J Cole has never put him self in that position to share outlandish ideas. Every idea he does share is well fleshed out and focuses on actual event happening. Seriously lets take a look at their lyrics.

I - Eyrs

>Man, it's so apparent you ain't one of us
That's why I had to get the windows tinted
Yeah, swear it's all about the new ideas
Man, I wonder how they let this nigga pop up in a year
Got me coughin', hawk up, pocket lotta covers and a mill'
Got the Dickies and the Balances, they counterfeit the field
Man, you gotta know the culture you a part of, man, it's ill
Sickening, man, I try to not let it get to me
When you 16 with a misdemeanor
That's no votes, are you kidding me?
This a kid saying this, literally
Pure evil, you are the epitome
Take my rights away, it's like whipping me
Take my life away with no empathy
Man, it's a nightmare, burying all my people
Y'all never learned history, goddamn
She don't care 'bout ancient Greece, oh man
Gotta put that energy in the step
OG's done told me to be next
Police always coming for our neck

How at all does this sound like Ni/Fe to you man? Most of his song, espically the ones where he unleashes his chaotic energy, follows this metaphor after metaphor that has 0 direct connections to each other. this is Ne/Si, he's connecting the objects that same the same subjective qualities but not everyone will get it. 

Jaden has chaotic creative energy, and i classify him as a creative genius. The epitome of Ne.

High for hours - J Cole
> Here's a thought for my revolutionary heart
Take a deeper look at history, it's there to pick apart
See, the people at the top
They get to do just what they want
'Til after a while the people at the bottom finally get smart
Then they start to holla ""Revolution!""
Tired of livin' here, destitution
Fuck that lootin'! Can you tell me what's the best solution?
I used to think it was to overthrow oppressors, see
If we destroy the system, that means we'll have less of greed
But see, it's not that simple
I got to thinkin' about the history of human nature
While this instrumental played
Then I realized somethin' that made
Me wonder if revolution was really ever the way
Before you trip and throw a fit over these words I say
Think about this shit for a second, you heard the way
The children in abusive households grow up
Knockin' girlfriends out cold‚Äîthat's called a cycle
Abused becomes the abuser and that's just how life go
So understand
You get the power, but you know what power does to man?
Corruption always leads us to the same shit again
So when you talk 'bout revolution
Dawg, I hear just what you sayin'
What good is takin' over
When we know what you gon' do?
The only real revolution happens right inside of you
I said, what good is takin' over
When we know what you gon' do?
The only real revolution happens right inside of you, nigga

You know what J Cole is talking out, His ideas all connect together to present one wholistic picture, and its focused on people. This is Ni/Fe.

J Cole has a strong focused & revolutionary/monk energy, this is Ni.

I rest my case :p"
1785,2020-06-23 14:14:39,hab9ad,"Se in socionics doesn't mean energy. Se in socionics means protecting somebody, hunger for power and pressure. Travi$ isn't pressing anyone and he doesn't want power. He wants to be protected. That's Se as suggestive function.

Ni in socionics is time controlling and making forecasts. Fe in socionics is analyzing people's behavior and etiquette. Yep, J. Cole made some forecasts in his song ""1985"" but he has A LOT of Fi. Fi in socionics is how you relate to something and your talent of building relationships. J. Cole is always talking about what's wrong/right, what he likes/dislikes. Please, do not mix socionics and MBTI. He may be INFJ but he's definitely not IEI.

Ti in socionics is causes(and Te is effects). Eminem always says how he loves his daughter/his wife/his friends. He is talking about his relationships. That's Fi.

As I said before, Fi is how you create relatioships with somebody. But Kanye ruins almost every relationship he gets! Also, one of his Reinin dichotomies is constructivism. Constructivists think mostly on Fi and Fe rather than Ti and Te. He often says how he relates to something.

We, 3D Se users, don't have wishes for power or to protect anybody. Because introverts(who have subjective thinking) have formulaic introverted functions and situative extraverted functions. That means that we use Se situatively, only when it comes to it. For example, there are types SEE and ESI. SEE's Se is load+inert+formulaic and ESI's Se is unload+contact+situative. 3D Se users practically don't show Se. Yep, creative function is one of the most hidden. As for me(SLI), I use Te ONLY when I need to use it.

Logic has an objective thinking(that means he's an extravert). Socionics is not MBTI, introverts here can be very loud and talkative but they still think subjectively.

Drake is always ready for new relationships, definitely Fi user. Also, he doesn't have Si(sensing of body, comfort, hot/cold, tasty/not tasty) as his pain function. You said about his horoscope - I don't believe horoscopes.

In some interviews I noticed Post Malone is talking about his body sensations. That's Si.

Snoop Catty Catt is Snoop Doggy Dogg, c'mon ;)"

I REALLY want to hear your opinion, I think that TheNightSkyDepot1 is just bullying everyone."
1788,2020-06-23 16:15:55,hab9ad,But you was right while saying Tyler the Creator is IEE. I agree.
1789,2020-07-23 22:40:02,hab9ad,"You got a point, the Cole lyrics are really Ni. I can‚Äôt argue that. I didn‚Äôt know for sure what type he was but IEI does sound about right. And as far as Jaden there definitely is a difference, his concepts seems to be much more all over the place and not dynamic and flowing and connected like J Cole. 

I‚Äôll have to rethink how I understand this shit."

Next time you make a fake account, wait longer than a week. I'm guessing you already have other ones dormant that you're working on like I suggested a few days ago.

I honestly don't get what your problem is but you're so fucking irritating, and  /u/starspangledbanbot was right, you're definitely being fucking malicious now."
1793,2020-07-23 22:42:14,hab9ad,"Best way imo is to get your own understanding of socionics and then test your understanding in real life, or that might just work for me since im an LII lol"
1794,2020-06-24 01:01:12,hab9ad,"Oh wait nvm I see you have eminem as ESI and Kanye as ILE. 

I agree with you on Kanye. Sometimes he gives off strong SEI vibes.

I also agree with you on eminem having base Fi, but I think he's EII. 

Both of them are fascinating to me because they behave in ways that contradict their types."

The third alt had mostly LGBT related posts, also not an interest of the m05 I talked to. The fourth alt had posts about living in Ottawa, Canada, and m05 consistently mentioned living in the Midwestern US.

This led me to believe they're either not alts of m05, or they really were multiple distinct people.

Admittedly, my PMs with the account also led me towards that conclusion. And I've been sleuthing around the16types for a couple weeks and I think I've identified some possible suspects. Which is also leading me towards the multiple people theory."

You made this account 7 days ago, made a few posts on ask Reddit , let it lay dormant for almost a week (that was your first mistake), then came here and started shit posting but you're actually being really careful which is effective.

Then after I called you out you doubled back to ask Reddit to make a comment from the post you made a week ago, to make it look like you are posting in other subreddits.

The dedication is impressive.

If I was you , what I would do is have at least a dozen accounts lying dormant, but imo you need to be commenting on each one at least a few times a day.

You're going to need a code book with all your usernames and passwords, which hilariously you probably already have and use to log in to your various accounts.

But to make it convincing you need to post regularly and follow up on comments. You can't leave these 6 day gaps because it's too transparent.

Interesting to say the least.

I do like how high you are on Maxey, but he‚Äôs a few spots lower for me.

What do you see in Garza to make him an almost first round pick? As an Iowa fan it was pretty easy to see why he wasn‚Äôt getting much draft attention.

3 players that I‚Äôm curious as to why you are so low on them.

1826,2020-06-15 19:17:59,h9mezz,"Even as terrible as this draft class is, I just can't understand how you can justify Tyrese Maxey at number 2 on your board."
1827,2020-06-15 19:22:05,h9mezz,What NBA-level skill(s) do you see in Hampton? And what makes you put him and Terry over Kira Lewis?
1828,2020-06-16 05:41:31,h9mezz,"OP is a very good writer. He will win most arguments because he is a good debater creating and asserting his own definitions and then bounces you when you use them differently or disagree. But him being a professional scout with originality, you'd expect a better track record.
  
Here are players OP had before Ja Morant last lear (post NCAA tournament big board): Zion (obviously), Barrett (OK I get this in a way and I think he will pop this year), Reddish (I was high on him too but over Ja?), Keldon Johnson, Daniel Gafford, KZ Okpala, Kevin Porter Jr and Romeo Langford. Over Ja Morant. If he were just a draft fan trying to have original takes then I'd commend him. But this dude is a professional scout.
  
 He has a few hits here or there (I remember he was high on Rui and MPJ being healthy), but misses like crazy mostly when he goes off the rails. His 2018 big board was deleted from his old website but the comments and his arguments against Trae Young or Luka Doncic to Sacramento over Bagley, show me a lot about how he evaluates talent. He wrote a whole article saying that what Ja is good at is learnable and what he isn't good at will hurt him since it's unlearnable and how other prospects will close the gaps. So yeah, I like reading OP and he's an interesting dude. There is a great chance he'll be right about a few of these (I'm very high on Meladon amd Maxey myself so I hope he is). But a grain of salt should be taken with the confidence he's displaying in his scouting methods."

-	Love Dotson top 20, i also have similarly high on him i think he‚Äôs underrated and don‚Äôt understand why Kira has the hype for pretty much the same traits 
-	Can you expand on Cole and his ‚Äúanticipation‚Äù what about it seems so special to you? 
-	Why so low on Nate Hinton? Is it for athletic reasons? He seems like a good bet to be a rotation player to me.
-	Would like to here more thoughts on Tillman, Can you see Tillman being a starter or closing playoff games?
-	Which player did you enjoy watching the most?
-	Which players are most dependent on what situation they land in?"

1836,2020-06-16 14:10:51,h9mezz,I see the potential in Aleksej Pokusevski but there is no way I would draft him top 5 that would be Dragan Bender level bad (not comparing as prospects) in terms of expectations.  He needs to go somewhere that he is not expected to contribute anything for a couple of years be able to stay in Europe to get his strength up and play some more pro level games up there.
1837,2020-07-05 07:41:23,h9mezz,"I'm significantly concerned about the athleticism of Killian Hayes. Or... lack thereof. I don't think that there is a starting PG in the entire league that possesses foot speed as slow as he does. People are saying that he's no different from Harden or D'Lo but comparing film you see a different story. Especially in regards to short area burst. Harden and D'Lo aren't fast per se. But they possess the ability to accelerate past in short bursts. You just never really see that with Killian. Furthermore, Harden and D'Lo both succeed because they are highly skilled. Harden is one of the most skilled scorers in the game. Maybe of all time. D'Lo is a standout shooter from deep and from mid. Killian isn't as skilled. I tend to believe he's gonna be a low to mid level starting PG at best and probably a solid game managing backup at worst (because he does possess the passing ability and is good in pnr). I'd consider him late lottery/mid first. Little bit higher than you, but not by much. Top 3 feels crazy to me."
1838,2020-06-15 19:01:09,h9mezz,What makes you like Dotson over Tre Jones?
1839,2020-06-15 19:05:31,h9mezz,">Those two factors matter a ton and when combined with his lack of clear weaknesses, they are more than sufficient to make him the best player in this class, especially in the absence of another good option.

Interesting that this is your criteria for #1. How do you feel about Grant Riller then? Outside of the obvious criticism that he's a 23 year old senior, I think he obviously meets this criteria

And the fact that you have Cole Anthony as the #2 PG despite *not* meeting this criteria (fails point #1). In addition, I understand your points about Killian Hayes, but I'd still have him above Anthony."
1840,2020-06-16 06:16:05,h9mezz,"I see Alston I give upvote, I am a simple man."
1841,2020-06-16 08:48:48,h9mezz,"Interesting to see some different opinions. I'm higher on Maledon than the consensus (have him #13 on my board), so it's nice to see he's getting some love. I also pretty agree with you on Hayes, when people evaluating him it seems they basically ignore a lot of his red flags with some over optimism they don't apply on others. 

Wanna ask question about Deni. I personally very high on him and think there is one swing skill that if he improve it he can be a star, and that swing skill is his ball handling. He's a high level passer for his size, has great size, more quick and mobile than gets credit for (has the potential to guard 2-4 positions), he can operate off the PnR like a guard, and has a guard skills on a power forward body, when the one skill that can help him put everything together is the ball handling. If he can tighten it to the point he can run an offense and create his own shots on consistent basis, I think his ceiling is super high (I buy his shooting because his form and touch both look reliable to me). Your thoughts on that?"
1842,2020-06-16 10:47:21,h9mezz,What is the two most crucial thing that you look in a guard prospect?
1843,2020-06-15 19:47:09,h9mezz,"man this take is a solar flare headed for earth!    I like it.... but don't agree at all.  :)

I love when someone says "" \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ has a jump shot that can easily be fixed"".  Then when describing someone else they don't like at the same position  ""\[\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  can't shoot\]"".  Lamelo's shot, much like Hayes's, Hali's and Theos needs work.   They ALL need work.   There's no way to tell who's jumper is going to be easier to fix... that comes down to work ethic and ability de develop muscle memory."
1844,2020-06-15 19:13:55,h9mezz,"LaMelo Ball scouting report:

* cannot put the ball in the basket
* cannot (and does not want to) stop other people from putting the ball in the basket

yet I do not understand why people continue to have him as one of their top 3 prospects on their board. Can someone explain this to me"
1845,2020-06-15 19:49:25,h9mezz,"Why so low on Cassius Winston? Like I understand he's old and his archetype isn't the most valuable, but he has so many enticing abilities. He's an insane shooter and a better passer than all of the other small guards. Like the argument against players like that is usually that you can find someone better in free agency, but that just isn't true for Cassius (or Flynn for that matter, who might be a top 5 PnR guard in the draft). I think he can be a better backup PG right now than what probably close to half of the teams in the NBA currently have. And clearly that's not the only thing keeping you back, because you have Butler 26th despite him having worse shooting numbers and being clearly less of a playmaker. Is the issue exclusively on the defensive end?

Others I disagree with: Garza over Carey - neither are going to be good defenders but Carey has a more diverse and scalable scoring arsenal and you're severely underrating his passing. The passing numbers aren't good and he's not at all ambidextrous, but he's a willing passer who could become a sort of offensive hub under the right developmental contexts; Garza isn't an NBA player.

Dosunmu over Jokubaitis/Lee/Bolmaro - Dosunmu is a putrid decision-maker and doesn't have the upside that any of these other guys have. Lee and Bolmaro aren't shooters, but Lee is a better athlete and better defender, plus he's a more creative scorer, and Bolmaro is a tier 1 passer and on-ball defender in addition to his good ball handling and underrated change of direction ability. Jokubaitis is what people wish Dosunmu were; a decent sized guard who can create off the dribble, score and playmake with some decent shotmaking potential."

1851,2020-06-19 18:53:06,h9mezz,"Why do you seem to be low on playmaking guards like Lamelo, Killian, Haliburton, Bolmaro, and Winston but you seem to be high on playmaking bigs like Aleksej, Tillman and, Perry and none high level playmaking guards like Maxey, Anthony, Dotson, and Butler?

Edit: Also, just wanted to add that I 100% agree on Okoro and that I don¬¥t see the Okoro hype at all. Okoro can¬¥t shoot a lick, is an overrated defender (especially offball) and is especially an overrated passer/ball handler as you can see with his near even AST:TO ratio and late reads when passing, which is never a good sign for a none shooter and I just see MKG all over again. I also see a lot of Jaylen Brown/Jimmy Butler/Iggy/Winslow comps but I don¬¥t see it personally. They were all WAY better mid range shooters who shot 3s/mid rangers at a higher volume and while Brown wasn¬¥t more efficient from 3 and from the FT line, he was from the mid range and was a better 3 point shooter/FT shooter/mid range shooter in HS with more functional mechanics/fluidity on his jumpers. Not to mention, he doesn¬¥t possess the passing/ball handling ability Butler/Iggy/Winslow did in college either, so I don¬¥t see it.

Feel a similar way about Precious/Bolmaro/Oturu too btw but I¬¥m not gonna go in on them since I am gonna leave that for when I post my big board. Overall though, I really like the big board a lot and like how high you are on Devin Vassell, Tyrese Maxey, James Wiseman, Cole Anthony, Tre Jones, Paul Reed, Tyler Bey, Desmond Bane, Aaron Nesmith, Xavier Tillman, and Killian Tillie as I have them all ranked similarly to you as well."

1853,2020-06-30 22:44:05,h9mezz,"Nembhard as a draftable guy is pretty interesting. I thought he had a pretty disappointing season overall. I guess that's why he transferred.

1855,2020-07-26 03:47:52,h9mezz,What is it about Oturu that makes you prefer him to Carey?
1856,2020-06-16 01:00:42,h9mezz,"This board is full of Hot takes, but this draft class will end up being very random so you got to respect someone going against the norm. Annoying to see so many public mocks having similar picks throughout the first round. 

Anyway, I disagree with a lot of these positions. Maledon at 1?? Not sure he's athletic enough to even ever be a starter, high-level burst you say, not sure about that, so many faster players in this class. I know he battled injuries this season, but he really did not make much progress as a prospect and that's why he has fallen down draft boards. I'm in the camp that Killian Hayes' game is much more suited for the NBA than Maledon's. 

The reasoning for 5, Aleksej Pokusevski is also very questionable. He will be much worse on defense than all of those players drafted before him with a similar standing reach because he's just way too skinny.  Defense for non-guards is key for young players to stay on the court and I just don't see him playing meaningful minutes for a while, if EVER. I don't have him in my top 30 and wouldn't take him in the first round if I was an NBA GM, his floor is extremely low. He's also a very poor finisher around the rim which is very concerning. People want him to be Jokic so bad, but he never will. Jokic was a force in the ABA and Aleksej shot 40% in the Greek B league and a shade under 10 ppg... 

Grant Riller at 45 (WITH LUKA GARZA AT 35!?!?!?!?). Looks like you haven't watched any tape on Riller and Garza will be lucky to get drafted if he even remains in the draft. Riller is the ideal backup Point Guard in the NBA can see him having a long career in the league, the guy is a walking bucket, could provide a team with secondary scoring. 

You also have players here that are no longer in the draft. Herbert  Jones and Andrew Nembhard are returning to college..."

1860,2020-06-18 00:29:58,h9mezz,what did i just read
1861,2020-06-15 22:01:08,h9mezz,"So basically with Garza, the reason he doesn't get much draft attention is by and large the low value on the ultra-big, right?

Basically with Garza, I think he's the most NBA likely of that archetype in a good while.  He tries on defense and is actually fairly good position-wise.  He shows some hope of being a capable shooter.  He's run NBA actions and isn't a strict post guy -- the Wieskamp/Garza PnR  was pretty unstoppable from what utilization it got not to mention DHO stuff.  He has an advanced enough understanding of passing angles to play those well.  And so on.  Basically Garza's an extremely skilled player fighting like heck against his body type, and at some point there's sufficient reason to think he has a better chance of winning than he guys behind him.

>Jahmius Ramsey

Ramsey just doesn't do anything.  He's probably not a completely garbage defender like some people think, but he's not good.  His handle is awkward because of how unnaturally low to the ground he keeps it, which means he doesn't lose it often but also doesn't get to the rim much.  He's not a terrible passer, but he's not good enough to justify.  So basically you're just left with this shooter who's kind of average at everything else and doesn't move without the ball well like the other high level shooting prospects.  That's not really worth much.

I talked about [Bey here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/h9mezz/my_201920_big_board/fuxocdf/)

>Precious Achiuwa

Achiuwa has basically 0 actual basketball skills but he's kind of athletic and tries really hard.  He's a terrible finisher at the rim, can't shoot, is only barely passable as a defender, can't pass, etc.  So you could theoretically use him as a small-ball 5 and just run people into submission, but Achiuwa has problems that keep him from actually fulfilling that role as a small ball 5 for any of the reasons NBA teams play smallball other than going fast, and going fast isn't actually as valuable as people tend to think.  I honestly feel much lower on Achiuwa than I actually ranked him, but everyone in that range has significant issues so at some point you just bet on someone figuring out a role best suited to his athleticism."
1862,2020-06-15 21:42:05,h9mezz,"The thing people don't realize is that compared to some stuff you see on individual actual scout boards, this really isn't particularly aggressive.  It's only in public scouting that people tend to think as narrowly as they do."
1863,2020-06-15 23:12:03,h9mezz,"So I already talked about a few points around this -- things like the shooting upside and the first step slashing/PnR are super valuable, especially when there's no clear weakness next to them because he's an above average passer/defender.  

But also, a few other less trait based arguments:  

He was regarded highly before the season, and almost the entirety of his fall was linked to a shoulder injury and being taken out of the limelight.

Being a productive player in the Euroleague at 17/18 is not exactly common, but he was.

Also I think he'll be the weakest #1 prospect since 2013, but someone has to actually be #1 and I think that he has both the best realistic upside in this class and a strong floor to go beside it."
1864,2020-06-15 19:43:42,h9mezz,"Well, here's what we know about Maxey from college:

We know he's 

* An elite finisher at and around the rim, both between his lay-up package and floater
* A highly effective point of attack defender, likely the best one in this class.
* A good but not elite rotational defender

Which on its own, yeah, would probably be a late lottery guy.  But Kentucky is the great limiting factor and guys get asked to be things they're not to fit a team.  Maxey is a primary ball handler, having posted the best AST:TOV of anyone relevant in last year's EYBL.  In college he virtually never got to run point at all because of Ashton Hagans.  So we have to consider what he was outside of Calipari.  And outside of Calipari, he was:

* An extremely effective decision-maker as a primary ball-handler
* The best shooter in the HS class.

And I may just be biasing again towards the lack of a clear weakness and over-biting on Kentucky's tendency to polarize their prospects, but basically it seems reasonable to be confident that even if Maxey is only a 36% shooter from the NBA 3, that he's still a valuable player relative to this class."
1865,2020-06-15 19:40:58,h9mezz,I'm not a Maxey fan in the slightest. Undersized 2 who doesn't shoot well and doesn't create for others very well. From what I've seen it looks like he just kind of puts his head down and tries to straight line his way to the rim most of the time. NBA teams are going to scout the shit out of that and he'll need to improve in other areas.
1866,2020-06-15 19:23:50,h9mezz,"Hampton is a good passer, but mostly he's not there for skill based reasons -- I think I might have him as the best draftable athlete in this class."
1867,2020-06-16 06:05:00,h9mezz,">But him being a professional scout

Someone should tell that to my actual employer, an insurance company.

>Here are players OP had before Ja Morant last lear (post NCAA tournament big board): Zion (obviously), Barrett (OK I get this in a way and I think he will pop this year), Reddish (I was high on him too but over Ja?), Keldon Johnson, Daniel Gafford, KZ Okpala, Kevin Porter Jr and Romeo Langford.

And here is what I wrote about that:  ""I consider players 3-9 here to be in a similar tier"".  Further, my assessment of what Morant is good at and what he is bad at turned out to be 95% correct.  What I didn't get correct is his shooting.  Which, as it turns out, is a highly variable skill that it's not actually clear Morant is good at rather than just riding a hot streak.

Not to mention ""He wrote a whole article saying that what Ja is good at is learnable and what he isn't good at will hurt him since it's unlearnable and how other prospects will close the gaps. "", which is literally a completely plausible explanation for what's currently going on.

Not to mention that literally several other major draft people had Ja that low.  Jackson Frank had him 6th on the first board I found.  Spencer Pearlman had him 6th.  Javier Pesquera had him 7th.

IDK I've been through this dumb argument too many times.  I pretty clearly outperformed 99% of boards last year including the actual NBA so I really don't feel like addressing it any further.

>I remember he was high on Rui

You remember wrong -- I had Rui in like the 70's (Edit:  On checking the board, I had him exactly 60), which is what a hit actually looks like there, since he's a bad player.

>His 2018 big board was deleted from his old website but the comments and his arguments against Trae Young 

Let's look at what I wrote about Trae Young!

>""Young was a significant negative individual defender, and is arguably the worst individual defender in this draft. He straight up had to be hidden against good opponents""

>Young was a great ISO Defender because he guarded bad offensive players exclusively when he bothered guarding anyone at all. He died on screens, was constantly lost, and there is absolutely zero argument for him as a competent defender if you watched how he got to those stats.

I think you're reading me speaking from the collective board that we did the mock based off of as my opinions on the class."
1868,2020-06-15 19:48:17,h9mezz,"I have Bey as a below average defender, below average handler (I don't think I've ever once seen him dribble with both hands in the same possession), and I have him a couple of tiers down as a shooter relative to the best in this class.

Expect Joe to be drafted in the 25-35 range, I suppose, but I don't have a great feel for that.  Houston doesn't have their 1st and they're the only team that I know really likes him so yeah."
1869,2020-06-15 21:33:59,h9mezz,">I suppose I never technically said to actually present an argument, and that's on me."
1870,2020-06-15 19:22:57,h9mezz,"Guys who are 6'7"" who can dribble, pass, shoot, and defend are extremely rare and extremely valuable.  The problem is that it's not clear how many of those Kalaitzakis can actually do (With a possible minimum of 0 of those things doable), but I generally tend to lean that the handling, passing, and defense are all real, which just means that if his shot, which has been inconsistent for a few years now, comes around, then he's a fairly rare player.  I think he compares favorably in terms of upside to Killian Hayes, but there's enough risk that a bit lower is reasonable."
1871,2020-06-15 19:33:57,h9mezz,"So my statistical philosophy around the draft is that I'm generally unwilling to accept most box score based aggregates (PER, WS, BPM).  They were tuned based on NBA numbers and don't work for the college game at all.

For component stats (i.e. things that describe a single thing), there's a few that I use.  AST:TO, FG% at the rim, etc.  Biggest thing here is that synergy stats are totally worthless and the ""threshold based"" methods that a lot of draft twitter uses really don't work either from a philosophical standpoint.  With shooting at large I tend to take a combined view -- if the mechanics don't back up the results, I don't buy in, but if the results don't back up the mechanics, I don't buy in either.

Realistically, I lean ""eye test"" overall, in the sense that college basketball's stats are woefully underdeveloped in comparison to the NBA's, so while I'm very much a stats guy for the NBA, I'm not so fond of what we currently have at the college level for use in scouting."
1872,2020-06-17 00:46:37,h9mezz,">Can you expand on Cole and his ‚Äúanticipation‚Äù what about it seems so special to you?

So basically when you watch Cole, there's 4-5 plays a game where the point at which he starts moving in response to an action happens a good 2-3 steps before the action actually starts.  The typical example I give is beating the ball handler over a horns screen, which should legitimately be impossible (The entire point of Horns is that it gives you a wide array of choices so it's not supposed to be possible to play a defense that involves beating the offensive player to the point of the screen when you're not even supposed to be able to know which screen he's going to take), but also there's times on offense as well where he'll appear to figure out how the defense is going to react before the offensive action has even started.

Now, it's hard to separate this from potential noise, especially when he also makes so many bad decisions too, but it doesn't look like a coincidence.

>Why so low on Nate Hinton? Is it for athletic reasons? He seems like a good bet to be a rotation player to me.

Yeah, it's mostly athletic reasons -- I think he's short of the physical tools to be an impactful defender, even though the outlier rebounding anticipation seems to indicate that he might be able make up for some of his lackluster physical tools via out-thinking the opponent, but that hasn't clearly translated in college so I'm not sold on that happening at the NBA level.  Plus I'm not sure he's clearly better than replacement level guys like Treveon Graham who you can get with basically no resource investment.

>Would like to here more thoughts on Tillman, Can you see Tillman being a starter or closing playoff games?

I'm not sure Tillman starts -- a lot of coaches tend to start games big and then go smaller down the line and Tillman is pretty much small by default.  I suspect he'll have low end starter level impact, though, but there will also be matchups that he just can't really do much about because of his lack of size and leaping ability.  Basically, I think he could close playoff games given the right matchup, and honestly his positioning might be good enough that he's the best option regardless of the matchup and in spite of the size, but I think the most likely case is he's just outside of that range where I would say I'd outright expect them to be a consistent part of a team's closing lineup.

>Which player did you enjoy watching the most?

Sadly, Kessler Edwards didn't enter this year, because it would definitely be him.  Out of guys who were in this draft though, It's probably between Theo, Isaiah Joe, and Tyrell Terry.  Underrated pick is Jalen Crutcher, who was a nice contrast in enjoyability to Toppin, who I found unpleasant to watch.

>Which players are most dependent on what situation they land in?

It matters a lot for like 90% of this class because they have so many weaknesses, but I think Anthony Edwards is the most interesting name to talk about.  Going to a place that will reign him in until he can fix the lower body stuff on his pull-up could be huge for him."
1873,2020-06-15 20:34:48,h9mezz,"Ranking Cole that high is basically a matter of betting on the outlier anticipation, along with some actual basketball skill recovery from getting healthy/getting away from Roy Williams.

Deni is outlier good at being on the right spot on the court on both ends, and I tend to believe that that's the most valuable trait in basketball.  Basically everything else that he does is at a pretty average level, but basically good teams have their guys in the right places, so Deni has a lot of value to a good team.

Hali, are you higher on him or lower on him than me?

I do not buy PatWill's defense at all.  Like I don't think he can guard his own position, and I think his team defense has the Zion problem where a lot of the highlight plays are just fixing his own screw-ups.  We've talked a little about the muscle imbalance, but I don't tend to buy that that's having enough of an impact to get him to good in this regard.  The flashes are enough to rank him 29, though I have concerns about his ability to stick on the court without a clear day 1 skill, and I have him towards the bottom of a tier so I wouldn't object to taking him a little higher, but generally speaking it feels like he was given Vassell level freedom on defense without Vassell level instincts and I'm worried that that's who he actually is as a player."
1874,2020-06-16 21:27:24,h9mezz,I think he's pretty clearly better than Bender; Bender had major passivity issues.  If anything Poku has the opposite issue.
1875,2020-06-15 19:07:31,h9mezz,"Basically I think Dotson's outlier speed matters a lot.  While Jones is the better passer and defender (I also have some thoughts about the differences in how they shoot that don't really impact the ranking), I think Dotson's ability to just blitz people off the dribble, especially in the context of the PnR, matters a lot both from an upside standpoint and from a floor standpoint.  I also think Dotson generally makes better PnR reads, in spite of his passing being fairly normal.  Basically if they're both PnR heavy guards, I'm learning towards the guy who can warp the PnR best.  But yeah, the ordering of those 2 + LaMelo I could buy in virtually any order because they each have traits that let them warp the PnR in a different way."

I don't really buy Riller as half that much a shooter -- I think he's fairly average in that regard -- and I also think his passing and defense are both moderate weaknesses, even if they're not big negatives.  The other thing with Riller is that there's some mild and unfavorable anchoring bias to Jalen Brunson for me (i.e. when I watch him, in my head I just keep asking ""Isn't Jalen Brunson just the same player but better), which puts a cap on where I think I can consider Riller.  I ended up even a little lower than that cap, but generally speaking that reasoning ended the idea of him in the 1st for me because I think Brunson would be in the Okoro/Butler/Jones tier for me here.

>
And the fact that you have Cole Anthony as the #2 PG despite not meeting this criteria (fails point #1).

Anthony is almost entirely a bet on the completely nuts outlier anticipation he shows.  Being able to actually beat a man over the ball screen out of Horns is just completely insane logically.  I also don't think he's an outright bad shooter -- the degree of difficulty on his shots is fairly high so the percentages look bad -- and while he doesn't have great burst, that seemed to improve after the knee healed better."

I don't agree with grouping guys together like this. I think someone like Haliburton has an 'if it ain't broke don't fix it' kind of shot. It's a little funky, but it works. He's been an elite level shooter in college.

Lemelo on the other hand has a fundamentally broken jumpshot imo. His elbow is way out, he pushes with both hands and there's so many moving part that I don't think it can ever be a reliable shot. I think he needs to rebuild his mechanics from the ground up or he'll be a terrible shooter forever."
1882,2020-06-15 19:19:33,h9mezz,"6'8 PG with great passing vision. People buy into the potential with his size - that's it. Also Sam Vecenie is bullish on Melo and I trust Sam Vecenie's opinion.

>Having said that, if Ball reaches his ceiling, he has the most potential to be an absolute difference-maker. He‚Äôs the one with the most upside. He plays a critical position of value that is tough to find as a lead guard. Simply put, in terms of positional value, there is not a center worth taking at No. 1 overall in this draft. Due to how easy it is to find those players on the market, the only centers who should be taken at No. 1 are those who have a high likelihood of being All-NBA representatives.

Edit: Also I wanted to point out that Vecenie in his latest podcast episode with Rashad Phillips had his ceiling comp as a 6'8 Rajon Rondo. So really his draft position is based on how much you believe he can use his physical tools to develop as a defender, he doesn't need to be a great scorer to be a valuable NBA contributor"
1883,2020-06-15 19:24:35,h9mezz,"Lamelo can score, his handle is really good, passing ability is insane. He is Rondo/Rubio w/ less defensive effort and a lot more scoring ability."

I don't agree that Carey's scoring arsenal is more diverse and scalable.  We've seen Garza run DHO, pick and pop, etc. where the full list of NBA actions Carey has run is basically that Horns PNR that Duke ran the exact same way every time.

I may have overrated Dosunmu's shooting -- one of the keys in when I was thinking through ranking him was the combination of athleticism and shooting, but my value on his shooting may not have ever been updated from last year because he was still making some fairly high degree of difficulty stuff.  That entire tier of players was fairly mind numbing to sort out so I should probably, and will probably, move him down.

With Ayo, I don't think it's actually clear what a ceiling version of him looks like, because he's kind of a lump of clay sort of player.  He can kind of shoot (maybe -- the mechanics are reasonable though the results were bad this year), his physical tools don't really restrict anything, he's an okay defender, kind of, he can kind of handle, kind of pass, and basically is okay at anything except for decision-making.  Part of the idea for ranking him as high as I did is that there's a very real chance to get him into your system and make him into what you want by actively prioritizing specific skills.

That said, I think he's the best defender in the non-Herb Jones class of this group, and I think his offensive value is entirely shooting based.  The floor is in his ability to C+S at a high level, and the ceiling is in the ability to pull-up around screens at a high level.  He's also a reasonable passer but basically I think he'll be a good enough shooter to carry some upside with his team defense."

But basically for the 3 that I think I'm actually low on in that area, the problem isn't the passing (Which I think it's important to distinguish from play-making, which I'm less convinced of for those 3 as much as a distinction exists), but that there's nothing beyond the passing.  

Like Poku's value to me isn't that he's a high level passer, though he is, but in that he's a high level passer who also take an unprecedented volume of 3's for his size.  Tillman's value to me is more in his impact as a defender that's in the right place on offense than his passing.  Perry's value to me is a combination of his ability to exploit mismatches.  And while all 3 are high level passers (sometimes), they have much bigger strengths to go alongside it that the 3 that I'm low on don't.

As for the others, I don't actually think that Maxey and Butler should qualify as non-playmakers just because they were played off ball more than most college PGs.  Anthony and Dotson are bets on outlier traits making up for their passing."

1892,2020-06-24 07:47:52,h9mezz,"So by and large, Edward is loved in prospecting circles for his shotmaking upside, right?  Basically people look at games like his 2nd half against Michigan St. or the game against SCar and go ""hey, he might be a guy who just explodes"".  

I don't see that at all.  I watched both games (among others) and to me he looked like the same player as ever, only the terrible shots he usually misses went in.  Until his tendency to flail his right leg wildly while pulling up going L-R goes away, he's not going to make those consistently.

But that's oversimplifying things.  While I don't buy the shotmaking upside, I do think he'll be a good shooter if he's not taking too many pull-ups.  I also think his passing vision is good for his role, but most crucially, I think his first step, when he actually uses it, is very good.  I think that gives him a very strong floor, even if I don't buy the upside as currently framed.

Atlanta is the dream situation for him.  Won't have to absorb excessive usage, but can still playmake off the dribble.  He'd possibly get some mild defensive cover as well given that Reddish looks extremely good there, but also so much energy is spent covering for Trae there that I wouldn't bank too hard on that.

Now, while Atlanta is the best option for Edwards, Edwards may not be the best option for Atlanta given that that undermines Huerter, who I very much believe in, but I think they'll figure out a way to make it work.  Maybe."

Basically he's a high level passer at size with some well developed actions -- he's a very capable PnR player but also has a post game that utilizes his size advantage over other PGs -- and a good handler/defender.  His shot is reasonable mechanically such that the percentages will probably recover, and all of that adds up to a reasonable back-up."

I mean he's not Dotson/Hampton but he doesn't have to be.  He consistently gets by guys, and for someone with his shooting/finishing that's more than enough.

> I know he battled injuries this season, but he really did not make much progress as a prospect and that's why he has fallen down draft boards

This is almost entirely untrue.  He's added the ability to relocate to find his 3 since last year.  He fell down draft boards because people think he's boring and don't understand competition differences between leagues.

> I'm in the camp that Killian Hayes' game is much more suited for the NBA than Maledon's.

That's not an argument.  That's a claim.

>He will be much worse on defense than all of those players drafted before him with a similar standing reach because he's just way too skinny

But he's already shown some excellent weakside rotations.  Are there guys that can overpower him?  Sure.  But he still projects as a good defender in the long run and potentially transformative offensively.

>People want him to be Jokic so bad, but he never will. Jokic was a force in the ABA 

You're arguing against something I never said nor do I believe because it's dumb.

> Aleksej shot 40% in the Greek B league and a shade under 10 ppg...

Right, and he also was aggressively pulling up for 3's, hitting passing reads most guards struggle to make at that age, and using his handle to full effect.  

>Grant Riller at 45 (WITH LUKA GARZA AT 35!?!?!?!?)

Yes, and?

>Looks like you haven't watched any tape on Riller

>Garza will be lucky to get drafted if he even remains in the draft

I can't be held responsible for the mistakes of the NBA front offices.

>Riller is the ideal backup Point Guard in the NBA can see him having a long career in the league,

Most backup PGs are both better passers and defenders than Riller.  Like Riller compares unfavorably to a guy like prospect Jalen Brunson, who is probably the 40th best PG in the league right now?  Despite having an extra 2 years of development and only being 6 months older than Riller.

>You also have players here that are no longer in the draft. Herbert Jones and Andrew Nembhard are returning to college...

1917,2020-06-15 21:25:11,h9mezz,">I don't really buy Riller as half that much a shooter -- I think he's fairly average in that regard -- 

I guess this is what prompted my question - you ranked Maledon not by his shot now, but how fixable his shot can be along with how polished he is at scoring inside. Riller is probably THE most polished guard in college bball at getting to the rim this year and while his shot isn't that good, I think it can be fixed enough in the NBA to not be a weakness.

So if your criteria to rank high is a fixable shot along with elite finishing, it seems Riller should be ranked higher. That's not to say I think he's a better prospect than Maledon - he's not - at the end of the day we're comparing a 19 y/o vs a 23 y/o, I'm just poking holes in methodology.

>Anthony is almost entirely a bet on the completely nuts outlier anticipation he shows. Being able to actually beat a man over the ball screen out of Horns is just completely insane logically. I also don't think he's an outright bad shooter -- the degree of difficulty on his shots is fairly high so the percentages look bad -- and while he doesn't have great burst, that seemed to improve after the knee healed better.

Maybe, I just dont trust his scalability in running the PNR at an NBA level, especially with regards to his footwork"
1918,2020-06-15 19:18:49,h9mezz,"Did you edit in the ""no weaknesses"" part? I swear I missed that on first read through.

What are your thoughts on Cole Anthony?"
1919,2020-06-16 20:58:50,h9mezz,"Agreed, well said. I just I think he can be more than a role player (a star) and to achieve that I assuming a better ball handling will improve the whole way he can express his strengths. Better ball handling would allow him to create for himself against any defender, be much less predictable, and would help him maximize his finishing and passing skills and taking full advantage of his size against smaller players. I pray to god the team drafts him will prioritize to strengthen his handling and on-ball skills. It can be a difference maker with his ceiling."

He tends to make the right read and seems to be an accurate passer who puts a lot of oomph (for lack of a better word) on his passes but the thing that worries me is the fact his passing is being compared to Winslow/Iggy/Butler when they are all well above average level passers for none PGs. 

Plus, while he tends to make the right read and is an accurate passer who puts a lot of oomph on his passes, I do think his reads tend to be an extra half a second later than they should and unless he learns to make quicker reads, he¬¥ll never be an Iggy or even Winslow level passer imo, which many think he is."

He missed a month with a shoulder injury and he continues to foul at an absurdly high rate - 3 a game in just under 18 minutes per YIKES (in Euroleague i.e. best competition). You also only mentioned one area he's improved on. Poor defender, can't keep up with some players. Handle is still a work in progress. Doesn't attack the basket frequently. 

Yeah I'm aware the difference between a claim and argument just planting my claim for future reference, for when Hayes is better in the NBA. 

The Jokic point was me referencing is stock inflation, not a first round talent. ""aggressively shoots 3's"" so he was forcing bad shots, yes another knock on him. His passing is the only intrigue. 

Does Riller compare unfavourably to Brunson? Brunson is the better defender, but Riller is the more advanced scorer and has incredible shooting range. Also over 40% on catch and shoot 3's. I would kindly suggest watching 5 more games then. You will regret not having him in your top 30.

So not aggressively taking mismatches into bigs isn't too big a deal for me when those aren't necessarily always the winning matchup.

Don't think the touch around the basket is better than average, but with his level of athleticism it hopeful won't have to be better than average for the overall finishing results to come out good."

Practically though, I'm not sure if you threw me old RPM or PT-PM for the college level (Which are the two best aggregates to ever exist) that I'd use either of them for anything other than potential identification of candidates to watch.  That said I will definitely use it for propaganda as necessary.

Ultimately the problem is that mathematically when you build an aggregate, if you're building it in a way that keeps you in the 2010's, you're using techniques that aren't designed for large outliers.  And you can do some things to mitigate that mathematically, but generally speaking you want your stat to be the best at ranking guys who are large outliers for the dataset (Which draft prospects fundamentally are), and I'm not sure that's actually plausible to do with the techniques involved.  Or any techniques really -- Outliers are hard things to handle."
1940,2020-06-15 22:19:49,h9mezz,"Potentially, but the thing is taking as many 3's as he does, even if you're missing them, is a fairly good indicator.  The form is definitely bad, and among the worst 15-20 in the league for that matter.

1941,2020-06-17 02:45:12,h9mezz,">That is intriguing with Cole, but if he has such outlier anticipation ability why hasn't it translated to his playmaking? I get that UNC is a terrible situation but I also understand it wasn't a strength of his in HS either (i am not sure, I dont really watch HS tape)

I think you do see it some in his playmaking, but also playmaking adds an extra variable because your teammates have to actually do what you're expecting so it makes sense that it's also relatively rarer.  But more often, I think you actually see it in the places where his playmaking fails.  A lot of the time this season, you would see him make a dribble move, get into a trap expecting his teammate to have relocated, and then find that his teammate had, in fact, not relocated, and turn it over.  But it's definitely not consistent and I definitely understand not buying into it hard enough to bother.

>2) I think the way Nate might be able to surpass a guy like Treveon is through his shooting ability. I think Nate is/will be a good shooter at the next level and I believe in him overcoming his physical deficits w his IQ and Motor.

Treveon was a good shooter until his shoulder injury, though I suppose if we're comparing Nate to current Treveon then it doesn't make sense to consider what Treveon used to be.

IDK my other thing with Nate is that his best and most unique skill (the long rebound tracking) is something that the value isn't clear but I'm leaning low because rebounding in general is a fairly low value skill.  So if that's what sets him apart from the other 3 and D 2 guards in that range, then I think I'd prefer to bet on Jalen Harris having already consistently run NBA shooter sets (Though Harris is a worse defender), or Green/Ramsey's athleticism.  Honestly though there's at least a few teams that should prefer Hinton over those guys."

>How much do you think Coles problems were system/context vs. lack of athleticism to create advantages?

65/35 probably?  The system and surrounding talent were pretty bad and injured, but also the burst was a definite but smaller problem.

>Is there a specific team context that you think would be helpful for his development?

I think he's one of the few guys who benefits heavily from going to a really truly terrible team, because it leaves 0 doubt as to whether or not he's going to get on the court.  I think if he goes to a team with any real expectations then he's going to have to develop while getting very little time, and I'm not sure he's well-suited to develop outside of active game reps."
1943,2020-07-05 19:42:02,h9mezz,"I think there's a real chance that Dotson gets to ""good enough that you can't just totally ignore him"" on that shot, which is really all he needs to take advantage of that speed."

You're misunderstanding what I think of Maledon's shot.  I don't think it needs any fixing.  When I talk about the manipulability of his mechanics, I'm not saying that he can fix his mechanics, I'm saying he can adapt his mechanics to suit what he needs to get the shot off.  It's something Steph Curry and Damian Lillard are both very good at and it's a big part in having a big upside as a shooter.

>Maybe, I just dont trust his scalability in running the PNR at an NBA level, especially with regards to his footwork

I think a fair bit of this is about the total lack of spacing taking away all the easy reads, but yeah generally speaking there's definitely no way to argue there's no risk with Cole because he definitely does have flaws.  But there's few enough upside bets in this class that unique ways of thinking about the game like Cole/Avdija/Hali/LaMelo are worth thinking about."

1951,2020-06-24 08:13:32,h9mezz,"Well the Warriors in general are weird for any fits at all.

Like if you're picking for their current core, then I don't think he's a great fit because he makes you undersized at the 2/3 between him + Klay, and if Wiggins is actually a long term piece then that's a mess too.  Probably not the end of the world, might even be a better option for them than any of the other available options, but not as good as the Atlanta fit.

But if you're picking for their next core, after Curry/Klay/Draymond are no longer top 50 players (Which is rapidly approaching already being the case if it isn't already for 2/3) then there's 0 long term pieces there except Eric Paschall.  Jordan Poole was a reach when they picked him and then somehow still managed to be much worse than expected.  And Eric Paschall is not a guy who should be informing decision-making.  So basically his long term fit with the Warriors is just his long term fit on a blank slate, which is fine, but isn't going to be as good as a situation like Atlanta where the exact role he should want is available to him."

>He missed a month with a shoulder injury and he continues to foul at an absurdly high rate - 3 a game in just under 18 minutes per YIKES (in Euroleague i.e. best competition).

You're actually arguing foul rate?  You do know that's virtually uncorrelated to defensive quality, right?  Not to mention his foul rate isn't particularly divergent from, say, Hayes despite the higher level of competition and the entire world separating them as defenders.

>Poor defender, can't keep up with some players

Except he's not, and that's not a thing.  Feel free to post film of it if you think it is, but I think you're mistaking him for Killian Hayes, who actually has that problem.

>Handle is still a work in progress. Doesn't attack the basket frequently.

Doing some quick math, based on the shot chart from the Stepien, 52/164, or 31.7% of his shots in the half-court came at the rim this year.  Since shots at the rim are less common in the half-court than in transition, his rim frequency is likely better than, or at least comparable to, Grant Riller's (34.9%)

>""aggressively shoots 3's"" so he was forcing bad shots, yes another knock on him.

I mean his mechanics are good and he's shown the ability at other levels to pull up from 3.  So no, that's not a knock on him just because on a tiny sample they didn't go in.

>Riller is the more advanced scorer and has incredible shooting range

This isn't really true at all; Brunson was a far better shooter over his college sample and actually finished better his last year in college at the rim than Riller did.

>Luka Garza can't defend a pick and roll. Good luck in the NBA. He's got some real slow feet.

I mean just drop him.  It's not like his feet are slower than Brook Lopez's and he's anchoring the best defense in the league.  You can get away with being slow (Which no one's denying he is) if you're big and patient, which Luka's actually fairly good at.

1958,2020-06-16 02:06:45,h9mezz,">Can you explain in more detail what you mean when you say Maledon has high level burst?

Basically he changes gears quickly and either gets by guys fully or gets them into enough of a disadvantageous position to take advantage of his excellent finishing.  I think the reason the general perception is that he doesn't have this skill is that unlike guys like Dotson/Hampton/Riller/Edwards (And also Kira Lewis), who are all comparable to him and admittedly, better overall at pure burst, Maledon often elects to burst by people and then use the advantage position to force the recovering defender to react.  Typically for Maledon it looks less like ""I'm going to take 4-5 steps and be at the basket"" and more like ""I'm going to take one really quick stride by you and then we'll start this offensive possession with you at a disadvantage"".  And I tend to think that that's more reliable at the NBA level where athletes typically don't just get completely blown by.

1961,2020-06-16 15:29:08,h9mezz,"So there was discussion of linking players above and how I generally think very highly of them, and Keldon Johnson as a prospect was a super strong bet to be an effective linking player because of his ability to score from 3 levels including off of mild movement, his above average passing for his position, and his defense, which wasn't elite but was at least good.

The other thing was the traditional Kentucky adjustment; he was pretty clearly getting less usage than he could handle, and was getting the ball in worse spots than most players, and he was still coming away impactful.  That + the pull-up shooting made me expect he had a higher upside than expected, which was the running criticism of him.  

Honestly I probably underestimated him as a finisher; I thought he would be good there, but he looks borderline elite.

But yeah, I realize not your gripe, but out of the Gafford/Okpala/KPJ/Keldon 4 that I keep getting crap for, if I had just moved Morant to the top of his tier then I'd be getting praised for how prescient that group looks because KPJ, Keldon, and Gafford have all looked good, even if it's been in limited time.

I do think it's worth noting that Vassell can't really do what Klay does defensively, even though I think he projects to be better than him.  Klay is at his best as an on ball positional defender.  That's not really Vassell's strong suit.  I think he'd actually more lighten Draymond's role than anything, which also matters."
1976,2020-06-16 05:18:46,h9mezz,"Just because they happen to have a valuable stat on hand doesn't make their analysis right.

I don't buy that stretch ability, mostly.  He's been a good shooter for approximately 10 games out of his career, and a bad one for the other 50.

>along with being a positive defensive contributor

This is the far bigger thing though; He has good length so he could theoretically be a good defender one day, but he's currently an abysmal one with little understanding of where he's supposed to be on the court."

1985,2020-06-15 23:50:38,h9mezz,"Don't agree at all that the passing has anything to do with LaMelo's struggles in finishing; He has 0 ability to deal with contact at all and consistently takes himself out of balance to avoid it.

And it's a very different NBA than it used to be.  Even the worst offensive players are still capable of attacking a defender as bad as LaMelo is.  And they might not run plays for that guy more than 10 times a game, sure, but that's 10 plays a game where you're giving up some pretty efficient offense even before you account for the level at which guys basically don't get to guard just one match-up anymore.

And yeah a big part of my concern with the shooting is that side to side motions are the hardest to fix, and LaMelo's shot has them both in the jump and in the bring-up.  The number of issues is relatively small in number, but I think his shot is harder to fix than just tweaks."

That's not what ICE is, though it does happen in ICE.  The technical term for that is zone up, and it happens in several defenses, including ICE, drop, and mush.

But zone up based defenses are by far the most common PnR coverages in the league, so if he can't beat those, what do you think he does?

And not only that, but what does he do against non-zone up based defenses?  He can probably hit reads against shows fairly well, but almost everyone can switch onto him for his lack of burst.

I don't actually buy that he can finish at the rim against smaller defenders too -- It doesn't show up in his film that I've seen.

As for the side to side motion, he shoots from his left hip.  That creates side to side motion on its own.  Additionally, he turns through his lower body -- look at where his right foot lands relative to take-off -- which can be part of a good form, but since he has it in conjunction with side to side motion in his upper body, it's a problem as well.  This has been reduced since HS but mostly that's because he reduced the jump at large so he's getting less power from his legs (Which is a separate, but more fixable, problem)."

1993,2020-06-15 17:36:05,h9k6v7,"Isaiah Stewart at 86 just basically means you don‚Äôt even think he‚Äôs an NBA player? Even a pessimistic view of him pretty much says he‚Äôs just another rotation big. He‚Äôs way too smart of a basketball player and plays too hard not to stick in the league. I also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs much of a leap to think he ends up shooting the 3 since he‚Äôs been experimenting with it since HS, which shows he‚Äôs mindful that he should be developing that aspect of his game to be a successful pro.

I commented on the post you linked to so just going to copy some excerpts of my thoughts from there:

>Wiseman- obvious equity as a paint presence on both ends. Even if that‚Äôs all he is, he should be one of the best in the league at this. This was a few years ago, but remember Deandre Jordan made multiple All NBA teams by just being a star in his role (and it wasn‚Äôt being a switch defender). 

>The real kicker with Wiseman is that he has enough skill rn that you can reasonably mold him into more than a one-trick pony on offense. Handling in transition a bit, using him as a DHO man, potentially a high post facilitator with the ability to hit the midrange J. I think it goes understated how much easier it is to see the floor at the NBA level because of the spacing; this should help mitigate some of his vision concerns.

>Stewart- I think you were unfair to his defense, he‚Äôs actually a pretty darn good defender. I haven‚Äôt seen any rim protection numbers so I‚Äôm open to being proven wrong but I‚Äôve always seen him as a pretty effective one since the few HS games I saw of him too. He held down the middle Washington‚Äôs 2-3 zone extremely well. He‚Äôs great at walling up because of his length and strength and generally avoids fouling while still being a deterrent. He‚Äôs very patient as a shotblocker too, he was great at contesting blocking jump shots in the middle of that 2-3 because he would lay back (as they‚Äôre taught to give that shot up) until they committed to the shot then he would pounce. I can see him actually being a really good pnr defender in the league. 

>Offensively, the reliance on the post game is just a college thing, he won‚Äôt be parked on the block calling for the ball in the league. But he is a load that draws fouls and knocks down his FT‚Äôs (77% on 6 FTA‚Äôs). Constantly moving and carving out space; will part the seas for your offensive weapons or clean up after them with O-Rebs. He has solid form (just a bit flat) along with the FT % that leads me to believe he should be able to shoot the 3 at some point. Has shown he can attack a closeout/faceup and drive. I liken him to a current Derrick Favors or a less athletic Tristan Thompson with more skill/touch.

Maybe I‚Äôm not going to convince you in particular of anything, but I do want to leave this comment here for others on this sub also. One of my large takeaways from the participants on the NBA subreddits is this over-reliance on switching and I think this needs to be said: SWITCHING IS NOT THE END-ALL-BE-ALL FOR A GOOD DEFENSE. Bigs that can‚Äôt switch are not useless and teams can accommodate them."

2002,2020-06-15 18:21:44,h9k6v7,"Thanks for the comment.

You're right that I don't see Stewart as an NBA player. I think so much of his defensive potential hinges on his ability as a rim protector, and I'm just not super high on him in that regard. I don't know how functional his strength is when protecting the rim, as I've seen guards finish through him, which will be an even bigger problem when you get to the NBA and have to deal with stronger athletes and more creative finishers. His IQ as a defender is pretty spotty, so I'm skeptical of him as a help defender as well. It doesn't really matter how long your arms are if you don't recognize a cutter or can't move well enough to recover. He also might be a little overrated in terms of his touch around the rim. I saw something that he shot below 40% on putbacks this year, so although he might have potential as an offensive rebounder, he might not be able to make a putback and he certainly won't pass the ball. So offensively, if his only avenue for substantial improvement is through 3PT shooting, where it's reasonable to assume he won't shoot over 37%, then I'm not super excited by that, as that isn't exactly outlier good to the point where he'd be able to make up for some of his other deficiencies. Compare him to someone like Jalen Smith, who I also expect would be a 37-38% guy at a high-level outcome, but someone who is not only more likely to reach that high outcome, but also has more valuable ancillary skills to provide additional value, in my opinion.

Maybe I focused a bit too much on the switching aspect in my past analysis, but even without that, I'm still a bit pessimistic about Wiseman's defense. He has a really long load time on his jumps, which I think will limit his ability as a rim protector. I just don't love his defensive instincts. He falls for a lot of pump fakes and takes himself out of position defensively, which is part of the reason why I don't think someone like Hassan Whiteside is a super impactful defender, even if he gets a lot of blocks. I will say he did a better job at that in college than in high school, but it's still a concern for me projecting him to be a high level rim protector. I just think it's easier to be a genuine positive defensively if you can switch, and if you can't, you really have to excel as a rim protector and  in drop coverage and although I don't think he will be bad in those areas, I don't think he'll be Gobert level or anything like that to where I would want to spend that level of draft capital on him."
2003,2020-06-15 18:22:59,h9k6v7,This is just who I think the top 100 prospects are I'm not focused on one team in particular. If it were just for the Knicks I'd definitely have LaMelo #1 and probably Killian #2.
2004,2020-06-15 18:51:56,h9k6v7,"He's definitely a risky prospect but its a risk I'm willing to take. I get not being high on him because of the athleticism and shooting concerns, but I also think mid 60s is too low. Basically, I'm high on him because I think he has the potential to be one of the most effective initiators in the class. He's a phenomenal passer (though he sometimes takes too many risks) and a really good ball handler for his size. I think as he matures (both physically and mentally), his offensive game will become more complete and he won't take as many unadvisable risks as a passer, though I like that he's willing to experiment. He might not be super athletic or bursty, but he's really creative and can change direction well, which makes me think he might be better at getting by guys at the next level than you might expect. He's also possibly the best point-of-attack defender of any of the guards in the draft. The off-ball defense needs some work, but I really buy him as a defender, especially as he inevitably adds strength. I think his deficiencies, specifically his shot, can be corrected to the point where he can become a league average shooter on high usage. I also just love tall point guards and I really like his playstyle, so maybe I have him a little higher than I should, but I think he's as good a bet as any if you're looking for high upside players."
2005,2020-06-15 19:13:08,h9k6v7,"I like those three guys for pretty different reasons, but idk if I'm too high on them. I really like Terry as a guy who can make a 3 off the dribble. That's so valuable and it could lead him to being one of the better players in the draft if he can reach his potential. I also like his passing and movement without the ball enough to where I think he can play either with or without the ball and be effective. Riller is a really easy player to like imo because he does so many things well. I've actually lowered on him a bit because I'm not sure how much he can develop as a defender, but he is such a skilled initiator, can get to the basket as well as anyone in the class, and is a top-tier finisher. His offensive package is really good right now and I think he can have a long career as a really useful 6th man. Maybe I'm a bit high on Dotson but I think he has the potential to be a low level starter if he can take another leap imo. He's good at getting into the teeth of the defense and bending the defense to create opportunities for himself and others, which is a really valuable skill to have. Also a really good ball handler and a solid defender at the point of attack. He's most likely a 6th man, but I really think he can provide pretty unique value for teams. 

Bey has become a little overrated imo. I think people fall in love with the 3PT% and the 3 and D archetype that he fits without fully understanding who he is as a player. I don't think he will be a dynamic offensive player with the ball in his hands, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I think it limits his upside, especially given how he had the ball in his hands a decent amount this year, and so ideally you would let him do that in the NBA, but he isn't skilled enough for that. So he's a 3 and D guy with a good shot, which seems ideal, but he doesn't move well enough laterally to be a great help defender or to guard shiftier wings. I think he projects to be more of a 4 in the league, and I don't know if he will defend that position super well, though I could be wrong. Reed is an interesting prospect and someone who I've had as low as 40 and as high as 20 this year. I'm still figuring him out as an offensive player. The ball handling is pretty cool though I don't think he'll be able to do it in the NBA and his shot looks like it will be there, but I still remain a little skeptical of him offensively. I'll definitely end up moving him around more on my board because I still don't really know what to think of him. Jalen is not my favorite prospect, and I really see him as a 5 in the NBA because I don't see him staying with most modern 4s, plus it limits his best defensive ability, which is his shot blocking. The idea of him as a stretch 5 seems appealing, but his legs are so skinny I don't think he'll be able to defend the post, so I don't really know where he'll derive defensive value. 

Ultimately, I think I'd rather have guards that I know will make an offensive impact in a number of ways than look for some frontcourt players who might struggle to find as clear of a role."
2006,2020-06-15 19:16:04,h9k6v7,Saben vs Kira was one of my favorite matchups this year and they both showed out. He's definitely a guy I'm willing to take a swing on because that speed is crazy. I'd love to get him on a 2-way contract and develop his decision making.
2007,2020-06-15 18:27:57,h9k6v7,I have lamelo/obi/Tyrese/vassel in that order of who's available.
2008,2020-06-15 18:33:00,h9k6v7,"I don't really see Haliburton as a primary creator at the next level and I think he needs at least one maybe 2 other offensive engines around him in order to be maximized. If you really like RJ to be a creator then I think Haliburton can be a good pick, but he's probably going to get drafted too early to a bad team and be asked to do more than he's capable of. Really like Vassell for you guys if the top tier initiators are off the board (and then I guess just draft like Dotson/Riller/Jones/Mannion with Clippers pick)."
2009,2020-06-15 18:38:53,h9k6v7,Haliburton's passing is very very good.  I think that is a underrated aspect of his game.
2010,2020-06-15 19:17:41,h9k6v7,He's a good passer but he isn't good enough at getting into the teeth of the defense or creating advantages off the dribble because he's so weak and contact-averse. I think the positive effects of his vision and passing ability will be limited due to his lack of creation off the dribble.

Off-topic but what are you guys opinions on the waiting room name game? I feel like a lot of people enjoy them, but personally I really dislike them. They have been done so many times and the names arent really funny enough imo. Also since the names are so crazy, I feel like none of the people waiting actually believe any of them. Maybe if they did half normal names or actually called out some of the names of the people waiting it would be a lot more realistic and funny."

2036,2020-06-11 20:11:33,h131j0,"I would say the only difference is Season 1, where they were clearly still working out some of the kinks and hadn't quite hit their stride.

2039,2020-06-11 20:35:11,h131j0,"I like the name game because the names are so ridiculous actually. For me, its just as funny without the other people in the room reacting."
2040,2020-06-11 20:23:45,h131j0,Name Game and the other challenge where they're sitting in a waiting room and they're trying to make each other laugh are my favourites challenges tbh.
2041,2020-06-11 21:27:42,h131j0,"The point of the name game is not about the other peoples reactions, its about the guys trying to get through the dumb names without cracking up. While the strangers' reactions can be funny sometimes, it's not the goal with this challenge.

2045,2020-06-11 20:16:27,h131j0,"I agree with this. Except for season 1, everything is pretty much exactly the same. It's like ranking Jeopardy episodes."
2046,2020-06-11 22:20:26,h131j0,"I disagree actually. I think they did go a bit wayward at some point in the series. I dunno if it was resting on their laurals or trying too hard, but I certainly found myself laughing less around season 7 time. 

But 8 series of however many shows in each, its bound to happen."
2047,2020-06-11 20:21:36,h131j0,Yeah you're right S1 was a bit different but still great.

Look at that sparrow's flight. It darts over the ground, flying too fast sometimes for our eyes to follow, missing rocks and trees by the merest fraction of a hair. But it is certain in its movement. If that sparrow was frightened of its own majesty, its own skill, would it not split its head when it stretched its wings? Or if it overestimated its speed, its agility, would it not similarly end up a stain on a rock? So you, too, must take your skills as your own, perfectly confident - and perfectly knowledgeable - of the heights you can achieve.

Sometimes, the world bears down on us like a boulder. Some are instantly crushed by its advance. Some try to lay flat and unobtrusive and are flattened. Some attempt to halt it and similarly fail, and it may be those men and women who are remembered in history as the great heroes.

Martyres usually die.

Faithful people should be trusted, but liars speak falsehoods.

For as long as you live, you will never die. 

Totologies must be true... Unless they are false. 

No mater what the cercomstance, the statement, ""So it has come to this"" is always correct. 

To exist is to be something, no be nothing is to not exist. 

What I say next will be a lie. What I just said is clearly false. 

The blind man sees nothing, the deff man hears nothing. The man who is both blind and deff is very unlucky. 

You cannot be anyone but yourself. 

It is better to have goodthings than bad. And better still to have the best, then the worst. 

It is not easy to do the hard thing.  

You cannot attempt something that you do not try

Nothing is impossible if you can do it.

Failure only happens when you do not succeed 

If you say wat is true is false, then you will be wrong.

The fool lacks knowledge, but the wise man is no fool. 

A lion is like a tiger, feerse and deadly. 

Some men are like the antalope, others are as the elephant. For in this world there are always two, the fat and the thin. 

Beware of what you cannot trust.

Never seek what you have found, and never find what you haven't lost. 

It is better to eat a modest meal than to starve. 

The man who goes to bed hungry dreams of pancakes (pretty shure this is a real saying)

Dreams only come when you sleep

Dreams are not real. Thats why they make no sense.

A map shows you what is written on the paper. 

Your journey ends at your destination.

When you have done enough its time to stop. When you have done too much then it is already too late. So you may as well keep going.

You cannot try what you do not attempt. 

You should not do what is I'll advised. 

Those who live in darkness cannot see. 

Grey is the color between black and white

I am. Therefore I think. 

Those who worry have many troubles. 

An analogy is like a metaphor. 

Snow melts in spring. And leaves fall in Autumn. 

The fire that burns an ice cube will not last long.

It does not take much time to do something quickly.

The Sun does not shine at night.

The ethical choice is the one you ought to do. 

Remember remember to not forget what you you do not cease to know. 

Having fun is most delightful. 


When you search for something, first look where it would be, then look whereit wouldn't be, then look where it couldn't possibly be (all creddit to my sister for that one)

It is faster to run than to sand still.

Also it's a conspiracy theory but I think a more understandable one. Some think it's techniques used by rich people to avoid paying tax. Buying art in certain ways helps you avoid tax.

*disclaimer, sexualizing a child is NOT a joke, and my referral to it being a ‚Äújoke‚Äù is that people keep saying it was ‚Äújust a joke‚Äù.

Edit: how is this *possibly* a controversial comment"
2251,2020-06-29 03:29:01,hhna13,"Is not funny that everybody is now cancelling him and feeling so offended for some shitty sensitive ‚Äújoke‚Äù he did around 10 fucking years ago.

I mean, no one gives a shit, except the people who have no problems in the real life and needs to feel identified with some  arrogant moralist with 1 million of likes in Twitter talking about how we need to cancel him"
2252,2020-07-02 01:08:03,hhna13,That‚Äôs my favourite Smiths song.

2255,2020-06-29 03:38:04,hhna13,"It‚Äôs not about being ‚Äúoffended‚Äù... it‚Äôs that he sexualized children. Why is this so hard for you to grasp??? Holy shit????

That is also *literally not true*. Many MANY people who are upset are upset because men JUST LIKE SHANE have hurt them, and there are pedo apologists like you who are downplaying his predatory behaviour as jokes. 

You didn‚Äôt answer my question. Would you be able to make the same ‚Äújokes‚Äù?

Edit: and by ‚Äúarrogant moralist‚Äù do you mean Jaden being upset on twitter because a grown man pretended to masturbate to his 11 year old sister? Are you seriously unable to see why he‚Äôs upset???"
2256,2020-07-02 02:04:05,hhna13,Yeah it‚Äôs a great song!!!
2257,2020-06-29 02:38:07,hhna13,"I feel like they can be mad at more than one thing.. also, did you *see* what Shane Dawson did?"
2258,2020-06-28 22:46:19,hhna13,"What are you talking about?? I memed a news story. Are you literally just pissed that I posted something involving a black family??

Edit: nice edit buddy! For context guys, he said this doesn‚Äôt belong here because this isn‚Äôt a BLM subreddit! Also? Not low effort at all, I stand by this joke, it is perfect and funny, and you‚Äôre a rude dork ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø"
2259,2020-06-29 03:53:35,hhna13,"Is ok to be offended about jokes of pedophilia, what is wrong is to attack him because millions of people do. And he said sorry few times. That was back in 2012 if I‚Äôm not wrong

2263,2020-06-29 03:57:50,hhna13,"You have not answered my question. Why are you avoiding my question?

Edit: oop lmao I need to go to bed, I thought you were that other guy. Apologies for being so intense about the question! However, no apologies whatsoever about anything else. Shane is a racist predator, and ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù is just a scary term people like to use when they don‚Äôt want someone to be held accountable. He should not have a platform, and if ‚Äúcancelling‚Äù is the route that gets a racist predator deplatformed, so be it. He deserves nothing, and we are under no obligation to protect monsters. People like to say ‚Äúit was years ago‚Äù... yeah, and? It was wrong 10 years ago too. Just cause he got better at hiding his abhorrent behaviours we‚Äôre supposed to just be fine with him? Nah. No fucking way."
2264,2020-06-29 02:45:49,hhna13,"The issue wasn‚Äôt that he was ‚Äúmaking fun‚Äù of willow *or* disney... it‚Äôs that he was pretending to masturbate to a picture of a child. Bad enough on it‚Äôs own, worse when you add the context of all his other predatory behaviour.

What are you even trying to argue? Who knows if they‚Äôre mad at Disney? That‚Äôs a weird guess.

Idk man, if you can‚Äôt see the issue with pretending to masturbate to a child..."
2265,2020-06-29 02:16:43,hhna13,"I wholeheartedly agree, dork ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2266,2020-06-29 00:22:48,hhna13,"I respect your view. I still stand by saying it‚Äôs perfect, due to the absence of even one flaw, but I respect you."
2267,2020-06-29 12:55:11,hhna13,"Sorry, that was my opinion too.

I mean, even if you find offensive the ''jokes'' he did, there still no reason to put him in a situation of shame and social pressure WHEN he already made a a video apologizing himself

You have the right to feel offended for what he did, but when millions get offended too, then you can't ''cancel'' him anymore when he is already ''canceled''.

I feel offended for what other people do and say, and I don't attack them, because I have not the power to do so."

2269,2020-06-29 13:25:29,hhna13,"It‚Äôs not that they were offensive. It‚Äôs. That. He. Sexualized. Kids. That does *damage* to the children. Imagine how 11 year old willow would have felt watching that video?You can apologize till you‚Äôre blue in the face, but you *can‚Äôt unhurt people*. Also, not sure if you watched the apology, but it was *not an apology*. It was an attempt to distance himself from what he did, & to blame his bad childhood. He took no accountability, beyond hyperbolic statements he thought we wanted to hear. He stole the structure of the video from Jenna, and much of the wording from drama channels. It was a crap apology, the same energy as the apology one gets from an abusive boyfriend who really wants you to let him do whatever he wants again.

I‚Äôm really disturbed by the fact that so many people think the issue with the ‚Äújokes‚Äù about children is that they‚Äôre ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù. *it‚Äôs that they did damage to ACTUAL CHILDREN.* 

If you made those jokes at work, you‚Äôd be fired, and asked to leave the premises immediately (and rightfully so.) On YouTube, it‚Äôs pretty hard to do that, so, a bunch of people have to collectively choose not to watch him in order to have him ‚Äúfired‚Äù. If denouncing cancel culture is more important to you than protecting his young viewers from his incessant normalization of racism, antisemitism, and pedophilia, I‚Äôd like to invite you to question that."
2270,2020-06-29 03:10:04,hhna13,"Man, everyone else who saw that video was sick to their stomach... might be worth looking into why it didn‚Äôt have the same effect on you. Would *you* be able to do what Shane did? Shane *does* ‚Äúactually‚Äù sexualize kids, also. The willow thing FOR STARTERS, the sharing dick shaped cookies with a 10 year old thing, calling a 6 year old sexy, saying a baby being raped to death is ‚Äúamazing‚Äù, simulating sexual activities in front of a 12 year old, going on video chat with 11-13 year olds and having them twerk for him, defending pedophilia, talking about masturbating in kids‚Äô rooms, making a whole fucking series about graphically sexually abusing a young girl (portrayed by a puppet) who is also raped by her parents, NEED I GO ON? And you‚Äôre sitting here defending him? Shit dude? I didn‚Äôt even go into the racism. You really wanna start with the ‚Äúwell what about THIS‚Äù bullshit? We‚Äôre not *talking* about Disney right now, so stop deflecting."

2274,2020-06-29 01:40:33,hhmobo,"So she's telling you that you're the property of your future husband. Sorry, but that's a fucked up way to raise a kid. You're your own person. You're gonna be equal with your future husband. And finally, your body, your choice."

Seriously though, WTF???"
2277,2020-06-29 00:01:06,hhmobo,Take the dogs!
2278,2020-06-29 00:47:21,hhmobo,"I'll start off by saying I'm really sorry that you have to deal with this.

People like this are a certain kind of stupid.

Loving parents don't harp on things that their child will never be, or will never try to push them into a decision that will make them change their mind. They give them autonomy and room to grow.

I can't quite fathom how someone can just say these things insinuating that the love they have for their child isn't unconditional. Even when they just so happen to be lucky enough to be born into the right standards.

You deserve better than this and I hope that one day you can have a relationship with someone as a 'parental figure' that really actually cares about you. Because we all deserve to have someone care about us like that. You don't deserve to be verbally harangued because you dare to disagree."

I do understand people who marry for the tax breaks (even if personally I'd rather not engage even if it means forgoing tax breaks) do that - and I don't understand people who actually want to specifically be legally married for the sake of it.

I know some people still stay in contact with family members like this. Not telling you what to do but you may feel relief if you move out after 18 and get some space at least. My mother was super controlling and had to know where I was and what I was doing 24/7. Basically had my brothers spy on me.

2312,2020-06-29 09:11:11,hhmobo,"I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. 

The cheap nursing homes are where you will find bed sores, malnourishment, and even emotional, mental and physical abuse. 

There was an article I read a long while back about CNAs that posted a video of two residents actually fighting and they were *encouraging* them to fight! 

I've seen residents that come from places like that, I briefly worked in a place like that, and it is so so so so sad and heart-wrenching to watch. 

I understand the sentiment but it's a different story when you see it up close. 

It's heart-breaking when these little old women start crying and apologizing profusely for their incontinence because they were punished for it in their last home. (Be it family or facility) 

They're often under weight, scared to speak, scared to eat, and are afraid to ask *for anything* because they don't want to be a burden or make anyone upset at them. 

It takes *a lot* of TLC to get them where they need to be - to make bath time a positive experience, to make toileting a natural part of their day, and to make them comfortable enough to ask for food and water. 

Bringing them to activities can be a struggle because they're so scared and over stimulated but I do it anyway - I try to sit with them and hold their hand so they don't have to be scared and I introduce them to everyone. 

I make a point to ask what they want to wear, what they want to watch on television - giving them agency where I can: it builds their self esteem and helps them realize they are safe now.

Elder abuse is a thing and its a *horrible, horrible, horrible* thing. 

I'd *rather* see folks pay a little extra to put their loved ones in a decent place and shut down those awful places for good."
2313,2020-06-29 05:32:23,hhmobo,You are why I will never have children. üôÉ
2314,2020-06-29 00:18:45,hhmobo,"I don't want to give them up. They're my babies and I care about them. Its not a frequent abuse thing. Its just when they make little doggy mistakes she threatens them. The plan is earn money while in college so I can come back and get them my sophmore or junior year. But i'll be sure to visit them from time to time and check up on them daily. Besides, they're one person dogs. They'd die of depression if anyone else got them."
2315,2020-06-29 04:04:54,hhmobo,"I was specifically responding to your own statement of ""I don't get why people wanna marry"" comment, rather than OP's preference of a legal contract :)."
2316,2020-06-28 23:17:18,hhmobo,">My mother was super controlling and had to know where I was and what I was doing 24/7.

Are we living the same life? She keeps on talking about how shes gonna follow me wherever I go and keeps on trying to convince me to go to an in-state college. She hates the idea of me being independent."
2317,2020-06-28 23:38:40,hhmobo,The point isn't whether she can take care of herself or not. The point is she despises the thought of it.

2323,2020-06-28 23:26:02,hhmobo,"I wish i had gone to an out of state college! I didnt have the money for it. I started working at age 15 and saved up money for college. I paid the first 2 years out of pocket. Then had to take out loans to finish. She said she wouldn't help me with college at all because she found out I was on birth control pills. I wasn't allowed to go on them because she is super religious but I have heavy periods and would miss school and work due to them but to her it meant I was having sex. There's no way I was going to have sex while I was living with her because I knew if I got pregnant I'd be stuck raising a kid under her. I never asked her to help me with college, I just needed family financial info that stated they had poor credit so I could get loans in my name and not hers. She refused to help me for 6 months and I almost had to drop out. Eventually found loans to continue college. She basically told me I was at college to find a husband and have kids. She's also racist. I brought my now husband home one time to meet her, he looks Mexican because he can grow thick facial hair. His dad is Welsch and his mom is Thai. She treated him like shit until she realized he was Asian and not so poor. Pissed me off. Anyways I'm married without kids. I changed my phone number a few times to get away from them and don't give out my info to anyone that has contact with them. Ive told other relatives I would like my info to not be passed onto them. Some havent listened and ive stopped talking to them as well. My parents like to do this thing where when they're mad at you they just show up unannounced on your fucking doorstep. Absolutely hate it. They do it on purpose and act like something is wrong with you, you offended them straight up gaslighting. I mean we live 2 hours apart and you can't call to say you're coming? Feels like a scare tactic. Im at the point now where we have a house and if I see them here I will tell them to leave my fucking property before I call the cops."
2324,2020-06-28 23:46:35,hhmobo,So you will put her there agaist her will? Is that even legal?
2325,2020-06-29 03:02:41,hhmobo,Wait a second....your parents show up UNANNOUNCED?!!! OH. HELL. NO!!!! üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†

2327,2020-06-29 03:17:43,hhmobo,"Yes theyve always done this. Even at school when they deemed me in trouble for something. My mom would come stomping down the high school hallways. Any time I see a family member and not expecting it I get this shot of like fear that zings through my stomach. I havent talked to them since I was 23, im 30 now, and one time I went shopping at the mall i used to near their house. I saw my mom at the mall and got that panicked/fear feeling."
2328,2020-06-28 23:59:13,hhmobo,Wow I'm stunned. What country allows to put their full rights citizens agaist their will in practical prisons? Except  they are mentally ill or criminals
2329,2020-06-29 02:09:55,hhmobo,Really people there's something like human rights. Maybe you heard about it?
2330,2020-06-29 07:13:02,hhmobo,"When a person becomes unable to take care of themselves, and their family is unable to do it either, they go into a nursing home, to where they can 24/7 access to a nurse."
2331,2020-06-29 09:00:28,hhmobo,"Excellent question! It does take a lot for it to happen but a person *can* have a relative placed in a nursing home for numerous reasons. 

- Alzheimers/Dementia

Both of these illnesses essentially cause the person to live in an altered state of reality. It affects their vision and hearing. For example, lighting on a tile floor can look ""flooded"" to them. A bathtub full of water can appear empty. They might start wandering around the neighborhood or forget to turn off a stove. Or worse, fall and hurt themselves. 

- Old Age

When they become too old to care for themselves. Usually this occurs if they've fallen at home and injured themselves - some go into facilities for rehab with the intent of returning home and sometimes they come back with another injury and become a permanent resident."
2332,2020-06-29 02:23:32,hhmobo,"Sounds like this mother does not accept gay rights, which are human rights."
2333,2020-06-29 09:10:56,hhmobo,"""The point isn't whether she can take care of herself or not. The point is she despises the thought of it"" Girl clearly wants to do this out of spite of her mother. So we aren't talking about dementia or that old age to not care for yourself"
2334,2020-06-29 02:31:29,hhmobo,It doesn't mean that human rights don't apply to her. Human rights apply also for terrorists and war criminals. Beeing shitty person doesn't refuse you basic human rights and law
2335,2020-06-29 14:29:34,hhmobo,"Well until she can care for herself she's obviously not going to a nursing home. But it's also obvious that her daughter will never nurse for her, so if she needs care/supervision/shopping/etc it's only happening for her in a nursing home.

Old people who live long enough definitely reach a stage where they are not able to take care of their house and food anymore, at 80+ usually.

Of course, even then she might be able to decline a nursing home, not sure about the laws. But then she chooses to starve because she cannot shop or cook and to live in an unmaintained home because she cannot clean anymore (and I doubt most people can afford help from their own pocket at that age)."
2336,2020-06-29 19:14:03,hhmobo,"No, they can't but there are programs in place to help with that as well. 

I've met *a lot* of residents whose families just drop them off and ride off into the sunset never to be seen or heard from again. 

This bothered a lot of CNAs until I said to them, 

""You don't know what this person was like until they became helpless - they could have been the worst person ever and are probably lucky they were even dropped off here."" 

I try to keep that in mind when they complain about families not wanting to come around - I do my best not to judge but when I think of the cheapest nursing home...

...I worked in one that had exposed wires in the ceiling, and the roof leaked every time it rained. I set up wet floor signs all around the area and redirected residents that headed that way. 

Some of these places...I've seen homes and apartments condemned for less..."
2337,2020-06-29 19:47:39,hhmobo,"Having children is often a thankless commitment... but to be fair no kid asks to be born either so it is somewhat strange to expect things from them.

That's one of the big reasons I'm happy I'm opting out of all of it, so many things can go wrong both with parents and kids it's enough for a headache."
2338,2020-06-29 21:23:32,hhmobo,It truly is and also why I've opted out as well.

2341,2020-06-29 03:06:53,hhkhyl,Interesting that this should surface just a day or so after Shane leaves a 20-minute long video on his channel in which he unequivocally apologizes for essentially his entire past.
2342,2020-06-29 02:35:06,hhkhyl,I mean Phil has never sexualized a child.
2343,2020-06-29 12:29:01,hhkhyl,"I respectfully disagree. His first response was to call the beauty community toxic when he hang out with the single most toxic group of people and saying he ""was leaving"" when he never ever was a part of it. (I can point you to a video explaining). After pretty much everyone called him out on that and started pointing out how toxic his actions were and how many times he was openly ""problematic"" to say the least, that's when he got the ""apology"" out. But the can of worms was out so we are learning more and more. His video is a PR attempt to save it."
2344,2020-06-29 07:23:27,hhkhyl,An apology isnt enough though especially after Jenna Marbles essentially got run off the internet for something he also did
2345,2020-06-29 02:44:33,hhkhyl,"Maybe not, but he removed his older videos, including a controversial racial video"
2346,2020-06-29 12:22:19,hhkhyl,"Nu-uh, don't compare Jenna 's real apology and taking responsibility for her actions and learning from her mistakes to Shane's pattern of behaviour for many years."
2347,2020-06-29 12:20:32,hhkhyl,That means he learned from his mistakes and has evolved as a person. Meanwhile we can't say the same for Sharissa or Joffrey Slot
2348,2020-06-30 10:27:28,hhkhyl,"I think he's definitely covering his arse, I wonder if the cancel culture will come for him?"

This [thread](https://mobile.twitter.com/misshemlock/status/1276465876607229952) has a couple examples of it. I understand making an edgy joke and I very rarely support canceling someone because everyone has said racist or offensive shit in the past. I just do not understand this pattern of behavior surrounding pedophilia. I really do think that he might be a pedophile because of how often he talks about it and the complete lack of boundaries he has children

There are accounts from girls who met him at meet and greets between 11 & 13 years old and he grabbed them, telling one ‚Äúgood girl‚Äù when she said she was uncomfortable but didn‚Äôt leave.

I was massive Shane Dawson fan as a kid, a few years ago I started to get back into him with his new conspiracy videos and I thought he had moved on and progressed as a person. I never looked back at the past controversies as I had heard people talk about his apologies, but when you watch them you see how excuse filled they where. It's so disappointing as someone who thought he had changed. 

I'm not saying Shane is s racist or a paedophile, but using them as your building blocks of comedy can't have been a good idea and I don't understand even his younger selfs thought process on it."

Shane is being laid out on the pavement (as he should be) but Jeffree is somehow not being mentioned at all even though the drama was originally centered on him. It‚Äôs all sliding off of him and onto Shane even though he‚Äôs complicit things that are worse. 

(Not to say that Shane‚Äôs words aren‚Äôt disgusting and abhorrent, but JS allegedly  witnessing child rape and then defending the rapist is on a whole different level)

E: I‚Äôd like to clarify that a lot of what Shane has done (racist and pedophilloic jokes) Jeffree has also done in addition to the Dahvie case and the groping, which is why I‚Äôm surprised he‚Äôs being left out of the narrative for now.

I did some digging and that was a fucking lie. 

In one of the archived pages from the wayback machine it has a blanked out photo with the definition of lipstick N* and it‚Äôs in reference to himself. 

‚ÄúJeffree Star- The immaculate queen of cosmetics‚Äù

In the same archived page it has at copyright stamp on the bottom it‚Äôs from 2001-2004 (2004 is when that particular page was archived)


I also saw people talk about how he was on this website back in the day called Melodramatic, so I looked it up and he was one of the top users and when I clicked on his profile name: some of his pages from back then were also archived.

In one of his posts he talks about his love of the swaztika and how it‚Äôs a religious symbol to protect people from evil, and that he should wear a swaztika necklace. That he doesnt support Adolf H*tler *100%* I‚Äôm wondering exactly what percentage that he did support H*tler back then. That he‚Äôs not a N*zi, doesn‚Äôt support the neo-n*zi movement. He ends his big ass swaztika rant with a quote from H*tler.

On the bottom of that page there‚Äôs a comment from someone saying ‚ÄúI guess you decided to not get the lipstick N*zi tattoo and the audio file that used to be on your lipstick N*zi site made me smile‚Äù this comment is from Jan-02-2004

On a different page he has a post about leaving melo he mentions that lipstick N*zi will be his new home, this comment is from April-19-2004

If you look at the wayback machine screenshots for his old website, the last change seemed to be in 2005, but it was still active (but abandoned) until mid 2006.  And that he had re-registered the domain with several different hosting sites from 2004-2006 (123-reg, tucows, and plesk) 

2001-2006 is a little bit longer than a week.

I also found a old livejournal screen shot of him talking about getting arrested on MySpace in 2008 for a felony weapons charge at the airport and he also mention numerous previous arrests for assault and vandalism.

His docuseries used to be incredibly hyped up and discussed before and after dropping, but thinking about it now I feel like his palette vids were only really discussed by the makeup community. That palette was the equivalent of a band being a sell out. Even though his other video was trending‚Äîthe ghost in his house or something‚Äîthere was no hype whatsoever, and it was just kind of him being paranoid ? His content is no longer interesting and aside from his hardcore stans, a lot of subscribers have fallen out of love with him. I guess getting involved with all that drama really diminished his creativity lol. As opposed to Jeffree, he‚Äôs only continued to give what his fans want‚Äîmore drama, more showing off his wealth, more Pomeranians... so they continue to turn a blind eye. Unfortunately if people are entertained they‚Äôll overlook a lot of things.

After all, it worked for J*, asking to be forgiven for the less problematic issues while ignoring the major ones. Wouldnt shock me if Shane got Js advice, seeing as how he copied his form. 

I suppose the difference is J* is constantly in drama and doing things that doesn't surprise anyone. Addressing anything was a left turn for J* as he avoids things till everything blows up. Shane isn't like that. He has sorta higher standards to most. He was better then that. He did stupid things but not usually. Hes percieved different. Just a theory.

What did you really learn, Shane?

Edit: also the first reply to me is spot on. If Jaden hadn't said anything, most things would have died. I guess that's another thing J* can be jealous of. An actual celebrity knows who Shane is and what he did."

She starts of by saying that she was scared to release the video, but decided to go ahead as it was ‚Äúthe right thing to do‚Äù Claims to have been told things by J that made her feel complicit to his actions

Verifies that she has never met J, but facetimed him twice

She explains that when she was making a video on Dahvie Vanity, J called her and manipulated her into not releasing the vid. She agreed to not release it.

When she saw J on the Chris Hansen podcast ‚Äúclearing‚Äù his name, she realized he lied and dropped the video

On the facetime when J was manipulative, she claims that J told her that James Charles raped a well known youtuber and he provided a voice memo proving it. Blaire feels that it is not her place to release the memo, but urges the victim to speak up.

She claims J told her that another well known youtuber raped someone, but while J provided no evidence, she believes it is ‚Äúbelievable‚Äù

She finishes by saying she doesn‚Äôt condone shanes jokes, amd that she just discovered everything like the rest of us.

To conclude, she provided no receipts, but i think not releasing the voice memo is understandable if its true

She says that keemstar probs has heard the voice memo as J is alleged to have played it to him before an interview

if he comes out supporting shane (which I highly doubt given his track record of dropping friends),  people will come for him for supporting a racist person who made jokes revolving children. 

if he drops him and claims he didn't know, people will say he is manipulating and lying and come for him with all his super problematic past.

either way he doesnt win.

but he's not ruined. if you saw the first shane/jeffree docuseries he talks about how makeup and youtube are the tip of the iceberg and he has business everywhere. so while I do think Shane's career might be over bc of this, jeffree on the other hand will still get his coin off camera."

Looking back at my love for shane when I was 10/11, there was so much problematic disgusting shit in his old videos. Not only racism, but pedophilia or innapropriate behavior with minors (does anyone else remember that young girl and him having her say ""My favorite flavor of popsicle is DICK!"". When I was 11 that was funny but now as a 20 year old looking back on that whole ordeal...gross. His videos also intruduced me to the concept of bullimia at a very young age. I still remember the very old skit where he was in high school and the girl he was playing ate at buffet and then threw up in the girls bathroom using a toothbrush. Thankfully I never developed a full blown eating disorder but I spent many nights over a toilet trying to throw up after eating too much and feeling guilty. His content was horrible for children and I cant imagine how he felt comfortable knowing his fan base was mostly preteen girls."

So that person should have lost his career, that's what he said. He distanced himself from from everything so to me it's not genuine.

Do we have someone else besides Blaire and jeffree who have said they heard the voice note. Not a ‚Äúwell we‚Äôre assuming we did‚Äù or ‚Äúsomeone else said they thought they did‚Äù but an actual confirmation that someone else has heard it?

Keem has said he and everyone else on moms basement have not heard it 

Ashlye Kyle has not heard it

Nick Snyder/the viewers voice has not heard it. 

Dustin Dailey hasn‚Äôt heard it. 

Peter monn hasn‚Äôt heard it. 

Kennedy sanders has not heard it.

If jeffree was spreading the memo around to everyone to listen to like gossip, then who the hell actually heard it???

The only two big gossip channels I haven‚Äôt confirmed with hearing this alleged note are rich lux and tea spill, but I‚Äôm betting they‚Äôd be screaming from the roof tops if they heard the note themselves. 

I‚Äôm just trying to figure out this convoluted mess because Blaire wanted to underline that she was a ‚Äústranger‚Äù and if jeffree shared it with her who else would he share it to. But none of the drama channels have heard it they‚Äôve only heard of it.

1. Jeffree knows that his connection to Shane and what they allegedly did to ruin James is hurting his follower count. 
2. Shane called Jeffree family so Jeffree looks like a fake friend by being silent while Shane's career crashes and burns.
3. Jeffree decides to act behind the scenes to deflect vitriol from Shane (and himself) to James by trying to change the narrative to ""Shane jokes about being a sexual predator but James actually is one""
4. He does this by dropping tidbits about James to outspoken people behind the scenes who he knows will speak out even if he tells them not to.
5. They post videos which get the conversation to be about James again either for the views and/or not realising that they have been manipulated.
NOTE: I don't think the internet is falling for it after the fallout from last year. I hope multiple police investigations happen because there are serious allegations being thrown around about Shane, Jeffree and James."

Also, because it‚Äôs blowing my mind that some people in this community don‚Äôt seem to recognize this ‚Äî> Blaire White is just as racist as J*, so if Shane should be cancelled because of his associations with Star (which he should, along w/everything else), so should he (& any other YTer) who‚Äôs buddy-buddy with Blaire.

He went through scene friends who faster than I have to refill my gas tank. One girl even talked about how hectic it was to hang out with him and regrets ever being friends with him (this was said about 5 years ago). 

Back in 2010, give or take a year or two, he was on a very small venue tour. We are talking maybe 500 capacity.  But he had a tour bus and he was still friends with daniel Hilton at the time. During the middle of the tour, He had the driver pull over so he could throw daniel Hilton out of the bus. We are talking literally throwing his personal items out of the bus and leaving him on the side of the road. 

I think that pre-cosmetics line, he would be all up and stirring the pot. But I‚Äôm sure right now he has lawyers advising him on what to address and then stay quiet. He doesn‚Äôt need anymore of his insane antics in written form because you can‚Äôt erase the internet."

You know who doesn‚Äôt constantly worry about being cancelled? People who have nothing to hide. People who haven‚Äôt done anything wrong. 

If he truly believed it was a ‚Äúdifferent time‚Äù back then, and that the ‚Äújokes‚Äù weren‚Äôt okay, he should have preemptively deleted them.

Think of the effect that had on our world, on the way we see each other and treat each other. Disgraceful."

2860,2020-06-28 16:39:55,hh8xbg,"Today I realized exactly how sinister Shane Dawson's docu-series has been. Basically he's an OG youtuber with a very problematic past teaching the next generation of youtubers how to re-brand themselves as likeable again. I can so picture Shane saying to Tana behind the scenes ""Girl, I did blackface, there are videos of me saying the N word. So you did a tana con-- we got this. Watch and learn"" Shane is such a fantastic manipulator of public opinion.

Moreover, the docu-series for Tana and Jake did an enormous favor to their public image, meaning some of the biggest young youtubers now 'owe' him. It is unlikely they will ever actively influence their following against Shane. This is even true of Eugenia Cooney, who overnight went from being 'a dangerous influence who must be stopped' to one of the most sympathetic people on the internet. She will always defend Shane and very few can speak against her because she has the ultimate victim card thanks to Shane's series. 

Ugh. Anyway, just some shower thoughts I had and wanted to share."

As a survivor myself, if I choose not to come forward then that's my choice and my past and my story is not to be used for someone else's benefit. 

If J* truly knows something like this then he has either two choices: a) keep quiet as per the victim's decision or b) take it to the authorities. Those are the two choices, not to use it to get more control over the beauty world, and if he's doing this then it's incredibly fucking slimy. 

I'm not going to wade into whether or not I think all of this is credible because honestly it's all really messy and there's no proof for the public. I just want to give my perspective on why someone would take issue with J* over this."

But I think the majority of Shane‚Äôs fans just grew up and look back now and see how really fked up all the things he did.

But now that we‚Äôre (I include myself cuz I USED to be a Shane fan before his Jake Paul vid) all grown up and everything is popping up again, we see how blind we were and how he tried normalizing that type of humor is soooo fked up. Most of his (ex)fans are realizing that the Shane Dawson they grew up with wasn‚Äôt funny at all and now it‚Äôs these (mostly) younger kids defending Shane. I think that‚Äôs my perspective and why most think it was ‚Äúa different time.‚Äù But it wasn‚Äôt okay back then.

2944,2020-06-28 17:22:10,hh8xbg,"Tdlr of blaire‚Äôs video:

She starts of by saying that she was scared to release the video, but decided to go ahead as it was ‚Äúthe right thing to do‚Äù
Claims to have been told things by J that made her feel complicit to his actions

Verifies that she has never met J, but facetimed him twice

She explains that when she was making a video on Dahvie Vanity, J called her and manipulated her into not releasing the vid. She agreed to not release it.

When she saw J on the Chris Hansen podcast ‚Äúclearing‚Äù his name, she realized he lied and dropped the video

On the facetime when J was manipulative, she claims that J told her that James Charles raped a well known youtuber and he provided a voice memo proving it. Blaire feels that it is not her place to release the memo, but urges the victim to speak up.

She claims J told her that another well known youtuber raped someone, but while J provided no evidence, she believes it is ‚Äúbelievable‚Äù 

She finishes by saying she doesn‚Äôt condone shanes jokes, amd that she just discovered everything like the rest of us.

To conclude, she provided no receipts, but i think not releasing the voice memo is understandable _if its true_

She says that keemstar probs has heard the voice memo as J is alleged to have played it to him before an interview

[here‚Äôs the podcast](https://youtu.be/oIHEWoGG-DY) 

Things I have heard already:

Shane says ‚Äúas a YouTuber, the only p***y getting thrown my way is 12 [years old], and I can‚Äôt touch it, legally‚Äù. 

Shane tells everyone to share their first masturbation story, and his cohost Jessie Buttafuoco says she is uncomfortable.

Mitchel says he got a DUI, and Shane tries to excuse it saying ‚Äúyou weren‚Äôt even that drunk right?‚Äù.

Shane says ‚Äúwas there all this young f****** p***y thrown at you?‚Äù (talking about underage fans)

Shane says ‚Äúso imagine this barely legal hottie comes up to you...‚Äù

Mitchel explains how he used his security team to coerce fans to coming backstage so he could hookup with them.

Mitchel explains that the fact that they were fans that looked up to him got him excited, and Shane eggs him on.

Mitchel essentially says that because they were his fans he knew they wouldn‚Äôt say no, and so he never had to ask for full consent, since it was ‚Äúimplied‚Äù. Shane continues egging him on.

Shane keeps asking Mitchel how it feels to know the girls he hooks up with as adult looked up to him when they were children.

It feels so disgusting to hear two adult men talk about hooking up girls and keep stressing how young they are. Shane is so gross."

Assuming Tati has heard it, and that they have reconciled, it's quite possible that she told him what was on the voice memo and he knows it to be fake (I mean, he'd know any way regardless of hearing it or not). It could also explain why Jebbediah is hesitant to leak it and is going through intermediaries. Maybe he's trying to see if James will trip or say something. Idk."

But for some reason, today especially, I'm having to keep my distance from social media because I feel like it's turning into an absolute shit show. 

IF there is proof an assault of any kind happened it should be taken to the police, not plastered all over the internet and being used like a tool for blackmail! 

The people involved are really pushing this to the next level of internet drama. It's become a vicious game of who is going to survive the hate, flip the best narrative and cause so much speculation nobody knows what's true or false anymore.

Edit: after it has been brought to my attention in the comments I'd just like to clarify that it is for the victim to decide whether they would like to tell their story to the police or not and I see my earlier comment is incorrect.

3033,2020-06-29 15:33:28,hh8xbg,"Asking a genuine question, because I'm looking for some insight on why this might be someone's stance:

Why are some people treating Ryland or Morgan as innocent parties they feel bad for in regards to Shane? I don't know enough about either of them to have one opinion or another on them as individuals, and maybe with Morgan it makes somewhat sense because you can't exactly choose your sibling's partner (and I only bring her up because I've seen her name pop up a lot here), but if Ryland has chosen to be with Shane all this time (I don't know how long they've been together), I'm assuming it's because he's unbothered by all of Shane's problematic behaviors and patterns?

So many of the things we've publicly witnessed is absolutely disgusting, but that barely scratches the surface of a person and if that's what's been shared, I imagine there's more (if not much worse) behind the scenes in private. At the end of the day, Ryland has made a choice to be with and support Shane and by extension, isn't that a reflection of himself and what he's okay with? 

I'm not attacking anyone's stance because, like I said, I don't know enough about him (or his sister) or have even watched enough videos to get an idea of who they are as people, but I'm curious about the ""I feel bad for Ryland and Co."" stance some have taken. If we hold people accountable by who they associate with and support, then shouldn't the same be said for Shane's friends and partner?"

He‚Äôs not like Jeffree or PewDiePie who‚Äôs already built a strong following by being dipshits who don‚Äôt give a damn, he‚Äôs no James Charles who‚Äôs still young, has the ability to defend himself excellently and who still has years ahead of him to flourish without feeling the need to be an edgy asshole or associate himself with shitty people like Shane did. 

The others who got cancelled by Jeffree in the past - Manny, Laura - they‚Äôre able to distance themselves successfully because they had their real families who were there for them when everyone was turning on against them. Same with James. I don‚Äôt know Ryland well enough but if it‚Äôs true that he‚Äôs mostly staying for the money and the status...that‚Äôs only going to make things a lot messier for Shane.

3105,2020-06-28 15:40:10,hh8xbg,"Now that we've got a better idea of what's been going on, I totally understand why people think that shane dawson is manipulative. 

I was (unsubscribed recently) relatively new to the channel, and I began watching him during the food-tasting, conspiracy theories phase. So I was absolutely unaware of what was happening, and the utterly blasphemous videos he had put out earlier. However, this new perspective has made me understand that the dude has been lying for a very, very long time. He painted himself as as saint. That image lasted for so long, that it really impressed itself upon the minds of new subscribers. Mine included.

To be honest, and I think most can agree that his documentary videos on jerks like Jake Paul and Jeffrey Star were honestly boring. It was biased, , and it allowed both of the above mentioned people to rise to fame again, despite being horrible people. It put them on a pedestal. That's when I began having issues with his content. Yet, this _good guy shane_ image had me justify to myself that his content was still good and it's okay to still be subscribed.  

He's also maintained this _poor man_ image for a long time, while spending time with people like j star and living in a massive mansion. Let's be honest that his vids became extremely boring when sponsorships became top priority and money entered the game.

What happened a few days back was the last straw. Thankfully, I have now unsubscribed. Phew."

Jeffree has been parading the supposed voice memos left and right, showing to anybody who'll listen apparently, since when this is ""protecting the victims privacy""? Coming out with those everytime you feel attacked? Trash.

I say we wait and see, if there is a victim, we help them, if there isn't, that's just it. I think we're getting closer and closer to someone leaking it either way."

Mainstream media is all over this one. Recovery always seems just within reach when the drama stays isolated to the average Youtube-savvy audience. But the general public‚Äôs caught wind of it.

Shane needs to keep his head down until this blows over, and then reassess. Jeffree has a summer release coming out in July, and a Shane restock to sell, so business-wise, he needs to keep his head down, too. Other people's jobs depend on them not going under.

Until this supposed person actually steps forward themselves, I am soooo angry that accusations are now being flung yet again at JC.

Otherwise, I don't know why Jefree wouldn't have leaked it yet - he clearly has no regard for this supposed ""victim"" or for anyone. I feel like it might just be a memo with a person saying they were involved with James and mentioning something like what the waiter said (he's clingy or whatever), and the reason the person involved doesn't want it to be released is because they don't want to be outed as a result. 

Of course this is all speculation, but I just don't see Jefree sitting on incriminating evidence against a person he hates, especially when it makes him look so bad to do so. I feel like he must know the memo (again, if it exists) is very flimsy ""evidence"" and wouldn't back his case as much as he's making it sound like."

It is not fair to JC to have these allegations out there. How can he clear himself? If he says he is innocent, it is heresay. The Alleged victim hasn't come forward. End of story."

Blair couldve easily done this for Shane, as to justify his actions in Dramaggedon 2 showing that there was some sort of purpose behind him instigating it.

3192,2020-06-28 23:18:18,hh8xbg,jefferson knows he can't say anything publicly to defend shane bc he knows he's done a lot of similar shit. i'd be surprised if he actually took shane's side but he's definitely not saying anything because he wants to save face. maybe he's supporting shane privately but if jafar says anything at all about shane on twitter/youtube then he's just asking to get himself into the same shit that shane got himself into
3193,2020-06-29 01:17:39,hh8xbg,Jaclyn glenn came out with a video on shane and said a new(?) thing that he only changed his content because he got flagged all the time?

I just think it‚Äôs so weird that he has this tape of JC but earlier this year tweeted at him about how he was killing it?? I wouldn‚Äôt do that to someone who I knew was a molester and had proof."

I'm not justifying jeffree for his past content but at least he attempted to hide it so any evidence brought up against him is not enough for him to get canceled. There are entire videos of shane being problematic so he can't use the excuse that it's taken out of context.

Which brings me to Safiya Nygaard. Where IS SHE. I only ask because I know that she is friends with Shane also. Wayy back in the beginning of the year she posted that there was an editing snafu and they lost a lot of content they had for future planned videos. After six months, it seems that they either haven‚Äôt gotten a handle on it again or are quietly just backing off.

Also, did I mention, this is incredibly f* up stuff and there‚Äôs proof?! The abuser‚Äôs feelings don‚Äôt matter and to me, what he has PUBLICLY posted is abusive towards his audience and those he has in those videos.

I feel manipulated as does everyone else I'm sure because we now have a case where Jaffa Shakes is using a recording - we cannot confirm or deny the validity of - as blackmail and ammunition against James Charles. It's none of our business to encourage the victim to speak out when we do not even know who the victim is because we really have no right of knowing in the first place. It's a mess. 
And I'm sorry but Blaire simply saying that she believes the voice memo to be real does not corroborate Jaffa Shakes' allegations against James being a sexual predator all of sudden.
At this point, I'm more inclined to believe that the voice memo itself is a fabricated piece of evidence executed by Jaffa Shakes himself. It may as well be because Jaffa Shakes is clearly not going to incriminate himself by releasing it. He also knows not everyone is a vile human being like him which is another reason why half of the youtubers have heard this supposed recording and do not feel comfortable speaking on behalf of the alleged victim.

The pervasive black face, use of the N word and other racial slurs. 
It‚Äôs a god send that he was vile to the poster of the child of a celebrity (Will and Jada Smith). This was a disgusting situation. I‚Äôm repulsed by what he did to Willow (then age 11). 
The fact that Jaden (her brother) and her mother Jada heard about this and responded may be what we all needed to get rid of this monster. 
I‚Äôm bothered that I can‚Äôt unhear or unsee the things that he‚Äôs done and partook in. I feel physically ill. I wish I knew about this sooner. 
The nerve of him to say that James needs a slice of humble pie the size of the Empire State Building is asinine. The people that continued watching him, supporting him, and making him this ‚Äúuntouchable‚Äù figure with so many young impressionable fans, scares the shit out of me. 
Gay, straight‚Ä¶ he is a pedophil3. It will be very telling if YouTube does not sort this out by the end of the weekend. 
He has (luckily and unfortunately - for Willow, messed with the wrong one). Will Smith is a Hollywood heavyweight. If Shane couldn‚Äôt be cancelled before surely Mr. Smith can get it done.

Edit: timezone"
3409,2020-06-29 12:36:00,hh8xbg,"While I don't think Tati is innocent, I definetely think JS pushed her, and when pushing wasn't enough I think **he gave Gabriel a nudge to shove Tati.** Remember, initially all we got was a vague ig story, and I think it would've ended had it not been Gabriel.

Jeffree couldn't push her to do a video because Tati would see his obvious intentions, so he probably commented on the situation with Gabriel. JS knew Tati was prideful and sensitive, she can't take even the smallest amount of hate comment, let alone an actual attack from Gabriel.

If you rewatch what Gabbie had to say, he literally says ""so spill the tea"" as if he knew that there was more to the story. A lot of people already figured out the vitamins part so why say spill the tea? He must've known or atleast sensed there was more to the story, because Jumping Stairs mentioned it to him.

Also it's really intresting Blair White did his dirty work for him. I wonder if she actually realises it.

Edit: I also think part of the reason that JS was spreading that video was he hoped someone else would out the victim instead of him. Why else would he leak it to drama channels?  
Edit edit: Yknow in a funny way, regardless of whether or not the allegations are true, Tati's video actually minimised JC's damage. By not falling completely in JS's trap had she done it, JC would've ended.

Instead she gave him the benefit of the doubt, and addressed the SA from what she personally witnessed instead of flat out accusing him of a rapist. JC said in his video that Tati turned ""around and did the very thing she warned him against. "" Which is exactly that, Tati tried to warn JC, and ended up being the lesson he had to learn the hardway.

If the allegations were false, then Tati's a monster, JC isn't harmed. If the allegation are true, people are reluctant and unsure of it, **because of Tati's video,** people are now hesitant on believeing the baseless acccusations."
3410,2020-06-29 14:41:32,hh8xbg,"This is still on my mind... I think Shane got into his feelings, maybe he didn't ""orchestrate"" Dramagedon 2 but he had a helping hand and wanted to punish a 19 year old for becoming instantly famous and a millionaire?? Yeah JC needed to be humbled a little back then, but the same has been said about EVERY teenage star. 
Without a victim going to the police it's hard for me to truly believe JC did something (I'm not even a fan) . That's such a distasteful way to knock someone down, especially if the allegations aren't true. Now if they are TRUE, instead of helping the victim get counseling, go to the police, and be a true friend to said victim, Tati, Jeffree and Shane, all adults and in their 30s used it for slander, drama and tea and self promotion. That shows their true colors as people. 

So now this victim, sees they can't trust who they confided in, has thousands/millions of people wondering WHO they are, just for drama. What a horrible position to be in."

3429,2020-06-28 23:59:00,hh8xbg,"Honestly, Blaire should have passed on this. Why does she think this video was necessary? It gives zero new information. The rumors of that memo have been out for many months. J* himself elaborated on Keemstar. 

All this did was ensure that even more people knew that there is an alleged victim whose private trauma shared with one person has now been played for everyone and their fucking brother. 

And the fact that he played it for Blaire, someone with whom he didn't have any friendship with? Everyone's heard it at this point - there's no way they haven't. 

Like, what was the point of this? Did she think this would make Shane look better? Or somehow turn the tide to JC when all she's doing is gossiping? 

And my eyes rolled out of my fucking head at the ""if you find my body in a ditch, you know who did it"" shit. Are you kidding me with this? You think someone is going to have you murdered for a video that did nothing? That exposed nothing and no one new? All you did was reiterate the exact same shit J* has been saying for almost a year now. 

Like, am I missing the new info that she's so terrified of revealing?


The conspiracy theorist in me says this was 100% posted at Jeffree's request in an attempt to pull people's attention away from defining him as a predator... but like, he allegedly shared a victim's voice memo all over the fucking place so even attempting to shift the narrative doesn't help ~~me~~ him.

3434,2020-06-28 19:36:45,hh8xbg,"I believe that regarding Blaire's relationship with Shane, her video was made with the intention to derail? and deflect the attention from him and onto James.

She was well aware of the voice memo for a month now, and something tells me that if shane wasn't in hot waters, this video would've never been made."

3438,2020-06-28 17:25:06,hh8xbg,"Personally I think Blaire is feeding right into what Jeffree Star wants. He's been telling everyone and anyone about this evidence because he WANTS someone to expose it and do the dirty work for him. And while I think Blaire posted this with the intention to highlight that Jeffree is horrible for spreading this insane info to anyone that will listen for malicious reasons against JC, I think really all her video does it point everything back at JC for being a sexual predator. Basically, I think Blaire's video is going to make people come for JC again, not Jeffree."
3439,2020-06-28 18:49:02,hh8xbg,Blaire is trending at #30 on Twitter.
3440,2020-06-29 04:14:47,hh8xbg,"Can someone clarify something for me? As far as I knew the only reason people think James may have sexually assaulted someone is because Tati called him a predator and Jeffree says he has a voice memo from the victim. Have more trustworthy people come forward to say they believe the allegations or have knowledge of the assault? I would just hate to think James is getting cast in this role solely because two shitty people said he did this. I'm not trying to play devil's advocate, I just feel like I missed something. Like someone we could actually put faith in saying they are sure this stuff happened."

-	She has called Black people rats and cockroaches 
-	She‚Äôs mocked Black women‚Äôs appearances calling their hair ugly 
-	She is a trans woman who CONSTANTLY invalidates other trans people and has said that non-binary people don‚Äôt exist...essentially there is only ONE way to be trans, and it‚Äôs Blaire‚Äôs way. Every other way doesn‚Äôt count
-	She lead denizens on online trolls to target Riley Dennis, a trans YTer. She constantly mocks and denigrates trans women‚Äôs appearances 
-	She is a fat shamer and body shamer, making entire videos mocking fat women. Again, irony here for a woman who didn‚Äôt feel comfortable in her own body feeling so free to dunk on others
-	She is a vocal member of the alt-right
-	SHE IS A FUCKING TRUMP SUPPORTER

Literally this is all just from what I remember off the top of my head! There is plenty more out there.

Petty Paige‚Äôs video is back up!"
3491,2020-06-28 19:50:05,hh8xbg,"Whenever there‚Äôs a scandal involving Jeffree Star, everyone who acknowledges what he is laments, ‚ÄúWhy is he never really canceled?‚Äù or ‚ÄúMaybe this time he‚Äôll really be canceled!‚Äù Some people chalk it up to his rabid stans or the protection that being a white male gives him. But I think we‚Äôre missing the actual reason he comes out of every scandal unscathed. 

Everyone who dislikes him likes to call him Joffrey as an insult. But that‚Äôs not the GOT character he‚Äôs most similar to. Jeffree Star is Littlefinger. The fact that no one seems to be acknowledging that is why he continuously avoids being held accountable for his awful behavior. Specifically other influencers. Somehow even when they‚Äôre ‚Äúrisking it all‚Äù and calling him out, they‚Äôre still playing the part he wanted them to. 

When Blair White put out her video she got *this close* to acknowledging that. She says Jeffree face timed her when she was going to release receipts about the Dahvie Vanity situation. Receipts that he told her were fake, but then went on to verify with Chris Hansen. He did this because he wanted to control the narrative. I‚Äôm sure he knew he had to give her something else to focus on to pull her off the DV situation. So he played her the voice memo from James Charles‚Äô alleged accuser. Blair even states in the video that she was confused why he shared that with her given that they weren‚Äôt friends and he didn‚Äôt even really know her. Once again *this close* to seeing a piece of his game.

Looking at this situation in the context of how he normally treats people leads me to believe he intended for her to make the video and ‚Äòexpose‚Äô him. That‚Äôs why he played the voice memo for her. He knew it would piss her off and she‚Äôd share it. He knew everyone would focus on the fact that JC was accused; not on the fact that Jeffree used someone‚Äôs assault as blackmail. His crime is dwarfed by the alleged crime in the voice memo. She played right into his hand. On the flip side, if she hadn‚Äôt made a video she would‚Äôve lived with the fear of it coming out that she knew. That fear would‚Äôve kept her in line. Either move she makes, Jeffree gets what he wants.

This is what influencers and drama channels seem to be missing. He is consistently three moves ahead of everyone. Anything he tells them has a purpose. Every move is calculated. He intentionally puts people in situations where they have the illusion of choice. The illusion of choice makes them think they have some power in the situation. They have no power. If they think he‚Äôs slipped up, he hasn‚Äôt. What he‚Äôs doing is more dangerous than ‚Äòspin‚Äô because his actions are proactive not reactive. 

I get the feeling that the people he becomes friends with are either A) too dumb to recognize him for what he is or B) think they‚Äôre smart enough to recognize his game and use him for their benefit. I honestly think he‚Äôs more dangerous to the latter. When he gives them information, he‚Äôs giving it to them for a reason. He seems to be very good at creating the illusion of shared risk. He tells them a secret so they will tell him a secret. He won‚Äôt tell theirs because he doesn‚Äôt want them to tell his. But the risk is never even. Just look at the voice memos Sanders Kennedy shared. On the surface it looks like a slip up. You‚Äôd think Jeffree wouldn‚Äôt want them shared because he‚Äôs being catty and shit talking other influencers. But he‚Äôs also telling things other influencers have said about each other. That‚Äôs why he said those things. To Sanders it felt juicy because he was ‚Äòspilling tea,‚Äô so Sanders felt close to him. Like he was an insider. Which is good for Jeffree because the information Sanders shares with him is useful. If Sanders gets angry and shares the voice memos, that‚Äôs okay too. Because that creates animosity between the other influencers without looking like he‚Äôs intentionally stirring the pot.  If they feel animosity towards each other they don‚Äôt talk to each other and most importantly they don‚Äôt trust each other. It‚Äôs a hell of a lot easier to manipulate two people who don‚Äôt trust each other enough to compare notes about you. 

He‚Äôll never be truly canceled because everyone keeps letting him control them. But the only way to ensure he‚Äôs not in control is to remove him from the situation entirely. It‚Äôs a catch 22."

Whoever trust this POS called Blaire White is no different. I'm almost sure this is planned with Jeffree Star so she can scare anyone else who would like to come forward with more accusations towards him while make more unfounded accusations against James.

Blair White's video so you don't give her views."
3587,2020-06-29 11:42:46,hh8xbg,"ughhHHHhhhh just saw that Blaire White video despite me kicking myself over giving her a view lol I have a deep hatred of the political commentary community in general though 

J\* weaponizing a voice memo and spreading it around like high school nudes is well...high school and gross and immoral. 

I don't know if someone else mentioned this below, but I didn't see it, and it needs to be said. I'm grossed out by Blaire's immediately messaging the victim and basically pressuring them to go public, along with illusively referring to voice memos and how ""credible"" they are. Everyone referring to this memo and basically taunting or baiting the victim(s)'s to make them vulnerable to the public for the sake of ending someone's channel for personal gains is just nasty; and even Blaire, despite her claiming to not be, is complicit in that. She goes on about how these memos aren't drama, but then her first reaction to the memos is to go and tell the victim they should publicly share their story. Why a public tell-all as opposed to suggesting counseling, RAINN, or police channels?"
3588,2020-06-29 13:57:33,hh8xbg,Keep in mind that if Shane wasn't in trouble Blaire would have never came forward with her video and would've remained silent .

3591,2020-06-28 19:50:11,hh8xbg,"I watched the Blaire video. For those uninitiated. She's been caught lying so much in the past and creating drama to get her name out there. With the Dahvie Jeffree situation she didn't just go by what Jeffree told her, she full on lied. There were videos showing that she took clips from TehMimi? videos (you could tell by the background music) and Blaire showing them out of context/lying. She also regularly copyright strikes people critical of her.


 The whole thing claiming James is a predator because she heard a voice memo is a load bs. You have no way to authenticate it without more info or having the full file to check context & make sure it's unedited, how convenient. She follows by saying that Jeffree claims there is another YouTube predator without receipts and she believes him. She brought up the James thing to try and justify Shane's actions before she had to shift her loyalty to Shane at the end. 


Here's my issue with the allegations being thrown around on James, the claimed victim isn't coming forward to tell their story which we would all listen to and form our opinions from there. This isn't a believe the victim situation. These are horrible people making allegations while hiding behind the guise of concern. 


Blaire is trash, Jeffree Trash, Shane Trash.


I could just as easily claim invisible victims for all of them if there is no requirement of receipts or an actual person.

**Edit:** Little extra on Blaire threatening to sue a publication for calling her an ""ethnonationalist"" which backfired because when they did their correction they described her actions instead which were far more damning

3593,2020-06-28 21:27:36,hh8xbg,"Hot take: Blaire White is a clout chaser and she‚Äôs trying to use this situation to bring more attention to herself. I doubt she has, or has ever had, anyone‚Äôs best interest in mind. She is a transmedicalist and holds many views that are damaging to progressive ideology.

So, don‚Äôt give Blaire the time of day. She hangs out with people like Ben Shapiro, Candice Owens, and Sargon of Akkad. She‚Äôs basically a grifter with no moral compass.

Let‚Äôs cancel her after Shane.

EDIT 2: Lol Blaire has ads on her video. She‚Äôs totally cashing in a J* check. Just like her videos on the predator Dahvie Vanity, where Blaire has links to her merch and midroll ads. Blaire doesn‚Äôt care about victims. She just wants that money from the liberal crowd that justifiably is worried about predators. Blaire is not to be trusted.

On Keemstar‚Äôs podcast,  J* said he cant play the voice memo due to legal reasons and a few minutes later, he offered to play it to Faze (which theu fortunately declined thank god) in another room like?????? 

Part of me thinks that this voice memo is fake but at the same time, it could be real and discrediting victims is not what I intend to do. It‚Äôs just horrible that J* is using the victim‚Äôs voice memo as a shield and he seems to give this away to anyone who tries to come out against him."

He's marrying (maybe) Shane, she's friends with him and has essentially made a career off of his back and they together are complicit. 

They supported him all this time, they're no angels. Same with Garrett, he's apparently distanced himself now but all of these people being labeled as ""not deserving of this"" because they're ""good people""... 

Are they? Do you know them? Because what we actually know is that all of these good people are or were, really close friends with beyond disgusting people and they've laughed alongside them and supported them this whole time.

Eta: sorry everyone, I'm not really able to give full replies right now but just for the record I'm not saying, nor do I think his friends etc. need to be cancelled and taken down with him...

3628,2020-06-29 01:19:10,hh8xbg,"For anyone who doesn‚Äôt know who Blaire White is, I recommend you read some info on her:

https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Blaire_White

Take what she has said in her video with a grain of salt. On numerous occasions she has spread rhetoric that is flat out false, and severely damaging to the LGBTQ+ community.

I think she thrives off of inserting herself into situations and providing dramatic and divisive commentary, without ever really providing anything substantial to back her claims (a blanket statement I know, but this is just my opinion). Nobody should be speaking for the victims, except the victims themselves.

Police need to be involved, and may be already. I can‚Äôt believe how this is all playing out, it‚Äôs insane really. 

/endrant

EDIT: Law enforcement should only be involved if there is concrete evidence to support these claims. Tea by itself is likely not evidence, and may be considered defamatory if being presented as factual when it‚Äôs not.

Either way, da fuq is going on in 2020."

If that's the case, how is bringing that up again without proof and without the alleged victim consigning the message any different from what Jacuzzi Sw*stika is doing? Its just tossing as yet unfounded allegations around for clout again, have we not collectively learnt to do better?

Who exactly is following Blaire to post screenshots of her IG story? Someone out there just happens to be paying attention to a white supremacist transphobe (which I only found out through this subreddit. Edit: also I had no idea about Blaire‚Äôs existence before this subreddit so I can‚Äôt say I find her believeable) and at the same time is paying attention to Shamalama Dingdong and Joffrey Starkist? (Now that I typed it out it‚Äôs believeable, there are billions of people in the world after all.) Then Blaire mentioned in her video that she didn‚Äôt tag J* in her tweets or IG, but used his name, and somehow J* is in her DMs asking to FaceTime. So if we believe her, then as she said, someone is keeping track of J*‚Äôs name on social media. And man, that‚Äôs just... feels so strange to me.

I don't think Shane is an evil person. I think he just liked the views he got from super edgy humor. And at the moment there was nobody stopping him because his viewers were teenagers who didn't know what was right and wrong and teenagers love edgy comedy. 

Although he's changed from making those sketches, I feel like his apologies were kind of half-assed (I haven't seen his new Shane apology video yet so I could be wrong). I also think he pretends to be naive and ditzy to avoid responsibilities. He's 31 and he acts like a teenager sometimes.

3712,2020-06-28 11:36:42,hh8xbg,"I know this is completely left field from the drama but I've been wondering, I've seen a lot of people say YouTube 10 years ago was different and that dark humour was popular and how ""it was a different time"" so we should forgive them as it was a ""different time"". (I don't agree with that statement to an extent). Since Shane was one of those YouTubers, I wonder how everyone else would feel about other ones like Smosh and Bart Baker. I don't see anyone trying to cancel them at all but instead people targeted Jenna Marbles?

Don't get me wrong, I do think Anthony Padilla has definitely grown as a person and uses his platform for good with his ""I spent a day series"". The point to all this is I'm surprised people are digging through Shane's and Jenna's past but haven't been going through other old offensive YouTubers like Smosh and Bart Baker."

 *Puts giant tinfoil hat on**

Shane posted a conspiracy video this January about deep fakes and voice changing apps. What if that's what this alleged video is of?!? I mean depending on whos voice is on the recording, there are tons of YouTube content of specific people's voices that could be fed into the apps. I know this is hella tin foil hat conspiracy theory, but it just got me thinking."

Jeffree is a piece of SHIT for using that memo as ""gossip"" or ""tea"" or whatever. I assume that's what he was going to put in the video last year, and I'm glad he didn't put it in the video.

3749,2020-06-29 00:11:03,hh8xbg,"Just watched Blaire White's response. I'm pretty neutral on her in general but her video (for those who haven't seen) brings up some very interesting points:

1. J* constantly reaches out to other YouTubers (who he's not even necessarily close with - remember he had Blaire blocked for years but suddenly reached out to her) and tries to do damage control if they threaten to say shit about him.
2. He has a team of people constantly scanning social media for these things. He doesn't follow Blaire on IG but once she posted something on her story about him recently, he facetimed her within minutes. She didn't even tag him.
3. He has no problem passing around voice memos and using people's experiences of sexual assault as leverage for him, and waves this evidence in other's YouTubers' faces as a way of bragging how he has leverage over others.
4. Keemstar, Banks, and god knows who else knows about this survivor's story. Which is so fucked.

J* having a voice memo from the SA survivor explains a lot to me. Jeffree and Tati came out against James so quickly last year but never showed receipts. This might be why. 

Regardless, my heart goes out to that person. I hope they find peace with whatever happened and if they feel the need to speak out, I hope they do it on their own terms in a space that's comfortable for THEM.

EDIT: Blaire says in her video around 4:00 that the voice memo was firsthand account from a YouTuber. I really hope you guys understand that it's not our place to judge the validity of a sexual assault allegation before hearing it. Also, when I say I'm ""neutral"" about her, it means I'm not familiar with her enough to form a stance on her at this point. Don't look into it too much."
3750,2020-06-29 13:47:51,hh8xbg,"If Blaire had any worth as a human she'd say ""shame on you, jeffree, for playing this to people and not going to the police"". 

Why the fuck is Jeffree even keeping the voice recording AT ALL? Why should he keep it in his possession? Either the victim wants to come forward and in that case will provide their own testimony to the police, or they don't want to come forward and Jeffree should delete the voice recording and not hold on to it. Period."

3772,2020-06-30 03:24:38,hh8xbg,"So, I been thinking about the whole blaire white story and everyone is saying that she didn‚Äôt do it to protect Shane because at the end she kinda says something about not knowing about the pedo shit. Even though on instagram she said to jeffree ‚Äúrelease the receipts or i will... get the heat off my friends back‚Äù pretty much disregarding the victim who didn‚Äôt want the voice memo out to protect Shane‚Äôs career. So much for caring about the victim. 

Anyway, I bring this up because apparently Lisa unfollowed shane (last I heard I could be wrong) and now blaire who was okay with outing a victim is now acting like she doesn‚Äôt support Shane. The thing is imo these women aren‚Äôt unfollowing Shane because all the gross shit. I mean come on Lisa dated the man for three years and was in numerous videos with him saying this shit. She co-signed it for years and even stayed his friend after the break-up probably for views but wants to take the moral high ground now? It‚Äôs obviously to save her own career. 

As for blaire her current channel is catching predators those are her most successful videos. How would she look supporting Shane in public now? However, the whole Shane calling a six year old sexy was public knowledge way before this and he was in trouble for it. I understand blaire said she thought It was jokes and that SM Manipulated it but Shane played off all his sick comments as jokes. So, if she was okay with that ‚Äújoke‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt she have the same energy for the rest? 

My point in all this last year JC said the Dolan twins unfollowed him to protect their own careers in the words of JC but still reached out to him. So, apparently it‚Äôs okay in the YouTube world to not be friends with someone in the public to save your image but still be cool with them in private. It seemed like jc was understanding to the Dolan twin unfollowing him. So, I feel like blaire made the video to get the heat off of Shane‚Äôs back and then added the end clip of her talking about his allegations to save her own career knowing Shane would be cool with it because personal careers would go first in the YouTube world it seems. Idk Something is just fishy around here imo considering it took the focus off of Shane and Jafar but back to JC possibly being a sexual predator."

I remember I used to watch Tati and felt like she was mature and classy/professional....that went downhill so fast when she got into it with that one smaller youtuber called Kiki Chanel. She literally victimized herself and acted like such a bully. After that all I could see was someone who constantly victimized themselves and conducted themselves with a lack of maturity.

I wish people would just stop giving Jeffree Star and all these other problematic people so much attention. There are enough problems in the world and everyone‚Äôs lives without this kind of nonsense. In the US there are literally over 120,000 people who have died from illness over the past few months and we should be focusing on bringing positivity into the world in such a dark time. Let‚Äôs not reward bad behavior."

I feel for whoever gave J* a voice memo about their experience. I'm sure this situation being recirculated is terrible for them.
Two white men (one of which has 0 professional training, experience, or talent in the industry) being given the opportunity to make millions in an industry (primarily for women) where women of all colors struggle to make it with years of experience - and then trying to gaslight them - is having real world consequences."

To actually take responsibility would mean knowing that you made a mistake and aiming for change whereas all he did was explain away (or attempt to) and try and distance himself by referring to himself in the third person.

The other thing I want to say is this: Shane is asking us to trust him without taking into consideration that what he puts on the Internet is the oy thing we have to go on. We don't know him in person and there is no way for us to know what he is really like when the cameras are turned off.

This is real life. You guys really think Jeffree would ask a popular YouTuber to expose the fact he blackmails youtubers with voice memos? That is a HUGE risk and I can‚Äôt imagine a powerful celeb like him willing to put that on the line. (Because if the VN is fake then it‚Äôs game over for him) 

We don‚Äôt know if this VN (voice note) is LEGIT, and if it is, we don‚Äôt know what was said to be true or fabricated.
It was just Blaires responsibility to report that Jeffree is using this voice memo over JC and to reflect how manipulative he is and how he holds ‚Äúdirt on everyone‚Äù.
I can‚Äôt blame Blaire for ‚Äúbelieving‚Äù this VN. 
We don‚Äôt know what she heard: could be a large YouTuber in tears talking about how traumatized he is from the JC incident or could be some clout chasing wannabe lying to Jeffree so he could gain his ‚Äútrust‚Äù and exploit him. 

Blaire did what she could, she can‚Äôt call the police unless the victim is ready to come forward. So she did the next best thing and reached out to victim (since she believes the allegations) encouraging them and also making them aware that Jeffree is releasing this VN to others as a form of blackmail/manipulation. 
She then made a video bashing JS, she barely mentioned JC and didn‚Äôt even talk about the content of what he did in this alleged VN."

To quote his parody of the Avril Lavigne song ‚ÄòHello Kitty‚Äô (pretty racist as you would expect): ‚Äòthe world only needs one stupid, crazy, talentless whore‚Äô. As said by Shane dressed as Miley Cyrus."

I'd almost spitefully create a tea channel(It would definitely be called Tearanasaurus Rex fyi) to scream ""YALL AINT SHIT"". Like, if I was writing this for an essay, I'd get marked down to D for not citing any clear sources. Blaire White CANNOT just say ""He's shown it to a lot of other people like keem star"" and then Keem star goes ""lol no"" and then EVERY drama channel is like ""Well I know it exists but I haven't heard it. Other people have""  


*who are these other people? do you know them? or did you just hear that this nebulous other has heard them and then just decided it must be true????? use your critical thinking skills.*

3888,2020-06-29 22:12:29,hh8xbg,"Man. For what the mainstream ‚Äúbeauty community‚Äù is, it‚Äôs far from being beautiful. It‚Äôs not even about the makeup anymore or the passion of makeup. It‚Äôs full of inflated social media influencers looking for cash grabs and click bait. What‚Äôs worse is Shane Dawson was never a beauty guru and all the attention of the beauty community is going to some loser YouTube pedophile like him. For what it‚Äôs worth, people need to start supporting smaller indie brands that are ethical, responsible, and most importantly PASSIONATE about the artistry of makeup. This BS with spilling the tea and drama in the beauty community has gotten way too toxic. I understand this is a beauty guru community but seriously, are all of you just as fed up with having to refresh your feeds constantly to see who has said what about someone instead of talking about the real focus which is makeup and makeup critique?

I can‚Äôt even look up a makeup tutorial video without something directing over to Jeffree Star drama or some influencers attacking one another on the platform. The reason why I am here in this subreddit today was I was looking up eye shadow techniques and immediately saw all these channels reporting Shane‚Äôs past clips of pedophilia. It‚Äôs disgusting and this is a man who NEEDS to get cancelled. 

Shane has been a huge disservice to the beauty community since he only got involved because Jeffree wanted to give him a leg up in making profits. Period."
3889,2020-06-29 23:39:48,hh8xbg,"When it comes to Blaire White's past with Jefeces, thought I'd share with people that arent aware of the BOTD/DAHVIE situation, what happened and why Jefeces reached out to her in the first place. Since I see a lot of people assuming things. (TW mention of SA).

Jefeces had tweeted back in the day about knowing personally that Dahvie Vanity was a pedophile, and a year later he tweeted they're ""family"" and people need to forget cuz it is in the past, and he then toured again with him. 
The commentary channels that are working on the Dahvie Vanity case found out the old tweets and started calling out Jefeve for him knowing that Dahvie was a pedo and still choosing to work with him. 

One of those channels was tehmimi which did a great video explaining the storyline. Blaire white then took her video, and put it on hers, BUT only showed the first Jafar tweets, making him look like a hero for exposing Dahvie and completely avoiding to show the rest of the story.
Conveniently she left out the fact (and the point of the video) that Jafar worked with him again and brought a known pedophile to a tour full of young girls. Tehmimi got obviously upset and showed proof that by the parts of her video that Blaire took, it was obvious she watched the whole thing but cut out the parts that exposed Jafar.

 Tehmimi made it clear that she gives zero shits about her content being used without credit and that her issue was that Blaire white was spreading misinformation, but Blaire conveniently ignored all of that,called tehmimi a clout chaser that was mad that she wasn't credited.

This whole situation and Jafarz actions being brought up, was what prompted his interview on Chris Hansen, and by interview I mean an hour of praising Jafar for his charity and amazing life, was a shit show.

That was a couple of months ago, but goes to show that were obviously dealing with someone that has a goal to protect Jefeces starshit. Make out of it what you will. I'm here to give more details to anyone interested, I followed the story closely."

3915,2020-06-29 02:00:09,hh8xbg,"So, I love watching drama channels but at some point today I was just like what's gonna happen cuz I'm tired. So, I pulled some tarot cards. I've seen some tarot reading videos on this situation and some drama channels have also mentioned readings...so I thought this would be fun.

Let me know who you think the fire sign is in all of this?

Cards I pulled for all three:

Jeffree: Page of Wands and the moon

Shane: tens of cups and ace of swords

James: ace of wands and temperance

my opinion is this...I think that everyone is going through the gigs right now but, James and Shane are going to be fine. I think that James is focusing on finding his passion in life and balancing himself out, and Shane is surrounded by the love of his friends and family and is starting to see himself and his actions clearly. The only future that is foggy Jeffree's. it's shrouded in secrets. I do think there is a FIRE SIGN who is not happy with him for telling his secret.

However, I wanted to give my two cents on the energy surrounding Jeffree star, as a Black woman, once the allegations came out wayyyyy back when I unsubscribed and stopped supporting him then the Shane documentary happened. I could feel he had a different energy and had changed a little bit so I decided to watch him through drama channels just to see what was going on. I have never purchased any of his products.

The cards tell me that Jeffree isn't a bad person. He's someone whos been through a lot of shit in his life and has learned a lot. One main thing he's learned is to never trust anyone and to always be on the defensive because everyone is out to get him. I think that's where the ""I've got dirt on everyone"" thing comes from. It's a defense mechanism because he has a good heart with those he cares about. He brings people close to him very quickly. People use him to get where they want to go and then try to dish the dirt on him.

I also saw in the cards that James really did what he's being accused of but not to the level that the internet is making it out to be. This is all just the craziest misunderstanding. I'm getting that he made someone (fire sign) really uncomfortable."

3935,2020-06-28 06:38:21,hh8xbg,"Is it because Jafar hardly ever apologises?

Shane is now copping a whole new wave of criticism since his terrible twitter notes apology and then video apology. He has essentially dragged this issue back into the spotlight several times, exposed it to a new audience and given people a further chance to criticise him by picking apart the wording in his apologies. 

I didn't watch his YouTube apology but I assume he brought up his history with sexual jokes targeted at children, people then found his jokes directed at Willow Smith and then that's blown up again because two high-profile members of her family have tweeted about it. This has then exposed Shane to a whole new audience that may not have been aware of his past, even if they knew of him. 

Apologising was long overdue and absolutely what he had to do but it is a double-edged sword from a PR point of view, especially if you don't get it right in the first place. 

Whereas Jafar is pretty clever about not addressing shit from his past (except certain things he wants to address that may not look as bad comparatively) and when he does become a trending topic on Twitter for yet another scandal, he cleverly buries the searches by giving away money to fans. 

I absolutely hate this guy but his PR management is like nothing i've ever seen."

3972,2020-06-28 12:03:29,hh8xbg,Because this most likely is being planned by starfish. We know the type of people both him and Shane are. He‚Äôs using Shane‚Äôs mistakes as a scapegoat to cover up his own rn. Cause I ain‚Äôt heard shit about him it‚Äôs all about Shane when this started about straw noodle.

And Zachary Quinto said he was the worst person he‚Äôd ever worked with and that he would never do it again. He was given the most amazing opportunity and immediately burned all his bridges lol"
3978,2020-06-28 12:52:39,hh8xbg,"I don't know about Hollywood, but he does want to make more films...

if anything it will negatively impact the overall reception of his next project, whatever that might be...if the likes/dislikes ratio on his ""apology"" video says anything is that the tide is def turning against him."

3995,2020-06-28 06:26:32,hh8xbg,"I think when the shock of everything dies down, people will come for Jeffree just as hard. Shane's stans won't stand for his BFF and ""family"" not speaking up for their king.

Funny, though, I don't see many people defending Shane. Maybe one-ish comment out of twenty. When Jada and Jaden Smith tweeted it was like, ""He's done.""

But I think the drama channels will swing back to J\* in a day or two when everyone realizes how far Shane is sinking and J\* is silent on Twitter. I mean, damn, there isn't really a way you can defend Shane for this shit but on the other hand, I thought they were fam? I know I wouldn't stand idly by and watch a loved one go through this.

ETA: none of my loved ones would do this fucked up shit, though, so idk."

The videos on Tanacon were also good / decent (even with his obvious bias), the Paul series was a complete letdown for me. And the Jeffree videos, were interesting enough, but he framed them as ‚Äútea spilling‚Äù, I feel like a more honest approach would have been amazing. 
I genuinely didn‚Äôt care for the drama, and as much as I don‚Äôt support J* getting to see the warehouses, learning about his business was very interesting. Buuut it ended up as an infomercial. 

And also I know a lot of people praise the editing style. But I can‚Äôt stand it."

4025,2020-06-28 06:46:51,hh8xbg,"He's well aware if he raises his head now people will spot him. Keep it down, let them feast on the distraction and when the dust settles he'll be business as usual

4027,2020-06-28 17:20:08,hh8xbg,He‚Äôs literally a demon. I could not help but be like wtf at that part lmao
4028,2020-06-28 17:42:26,hh8xbg,"It kinda makes sense though. If I was Jeffree, paying people to monitor SM like that would be a must. He‚Äôs got a plethora of awful things he‚Äôs done in the past that could come out, he constantly manipulates people to control the narrative, and he makes enemies very, very quickly. He has to monitor things to that level to be able to control how the situation develops. So not only is he an awful, manipulative person who enjoys hurting people, but he‚Äôs a paranoid one with the money to indulge that paranoia. 

I also get the feeling he records and saves everything. Nothing is ever too small to possibly be a weapon against someone else. I would assume he intentionally shares influencers talking shit about each other to create animosity between them. So they don‚Äôt share what they both know about him. That keeps everyone only knowing exactly what he wants them to know and they‚Äôre much easier to control. 

All this explains why influencers seem to be genuinely afraid of him. If you say his name, he immediately knows and begins manipulating the narrative to focus on anything bad you‚Äôve ever done. If he has receipts, you‚Äôre extra screwed. Even if he doesn‚Äôt, he knows that one of his fans or another influencer who‚Äôs trying to stay in his good graces will give him something. Then he uses his very large fan base to drown your name with comments about whatever bad thing you did. No one comes to your defense because they‚Äôre afraid of him too and because he‚Äôs shared every catty thing you‚Äôve ever said about them. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs playing chess with people‚Äôs lives and careers."
4029,2020-06-29 18:06:25,hh8xbg,Classic projection. I also wouldn't be surprised if J\* enabled James' hitting on straight dudes period in the guise of being a good mentor.
4030,2020-06-29 18:08:24,hh8xbg,Also the fact that he only brought up this alleged tape again when he was being asked about his involvement with Dahvie and the BOTDF situation.
4031,2020-06-29 19:18:18,hh8xbg,I dont see enough people talking about the absolute power move James pulled in his no more lies video when he used a jeffree clip to explain what it meant to be attracted to straight guys lol
4032,2020-06-29 18:01:36,hh8xbg,"there's literally dozens of tweets of him @ ing band members and other dudes about their dicks. it's easy to use twitter's advanced search feature to see him harassing people. its the same shit as harassing a woman to see her tits or something, seriously. it's disgusting behavior.

As to the first point, I agree that J\* is getting a lot less attention as the SD stuff gains more and more momentum. Personally, I don't think any kind of intervention on his part would have been necessary - SD is imploding all on his own. It is telling that he hasn't released any kind of statement at all though."

IMO if they‚Äôve hung around him for so long, they‚Äôre not gonna pick up and leave just because the public is against him. Or maybe it will be enough for them to reconsider their relationships. I don‚Äôt know"
4135,2020-06-29 04:19:40,hh8xbg,"Morgan's current career is riding on Ryland's coattails & Ryland's on Shane's. Not to dismiss Ryland's independent work pre-Shane but let's be real.

Shane can retire today and still continue living a luxurious life. I don't think this will affect their relationship in any way"
4136,2020-06-29 04:21:14,hh8xbg,"Ryland should probably leave. All the footage resurfacing is like a color guard competition‚Äôs worth of red flags. Plus, from what I‚Äôve gathered, Shane never seemed like a great boyfriend to begin with."

4145,2020-06-28 07:40:03,hh8xbg,Right? Jeffree is way worse than shane
4146,2020-06-28 08:10:50,hh8xbg,"I'm not sure, but I have a theory:

Project and-or ignore.

He either points fingers enough to make the other person look just as bad and then sits back to watch the fireworks explode

Or ignores the drama enough where it just disappears

This time it was the former, but he didn't even have to be the one pointing this time. With this current political climate and somebody (I don't even remember who) bringing up Dramageddeon, it was the perfect storm for Shane to be called out as well. When the spotlight was both on them, he just slowly moved from the spotlight. 
Also, J* has a fandom just as terrible as he is (and if they're not, they are way more forgiving than him), so they'll let things slide. They don't care what shitty thing Jafar has done. They probably never will. Shane on the other hand built his *current* reputation on empathy and being niceish. His fandom will care more about racism and pedophilia more than J's stans will. So people hold him to a higherish standard I think.

And as a side note, this all could have been just a blip on the radar (for his livlihood at least) if he had just stayed quiet and hired an extra PR person or 2. Maybe.

And that's it. Boom, J* is off the hook yet again, but Shane's out. Well not really because you already have people taking up his apology."
4147,2020-06-28 07:43:54,hh8xbg,This! Why does it seems like he is getting off scot-free? This is not okay!

4152,2020-06-28 06:08:54,hh8xbg,The only reason why shane survived for so long is because he maintained the same audience demographic and basically became a character. Most youtubers die out when they move on to bigger things or  stop making the same content.

I watched one Shane Dawson video between the key of awesome and smosh videos and it was him trying to sexualise and make incest jokes about Hannah Montana and I was just so uncomfortable. I guess that was his peak shock value time, but I never got in on the hype. 
When Shane said he‚Äôs taking inspiration off Jenna I was hoping he meant he was going to give his channel a break which he definitely should‚Äôve done. I feel like it won‚Äôt be long before he‚Äôs apologising again for something else."

I was more of a Nighiga and Smosh fan. If Shane was smart.....he would have faded away quietly like Glozell or been content with not having trending videos all the time and staying more Lowkey like Ryan Higa or the Smosh guys.

It's two different things ... but no punctuation to get people to be like 'manny is suing shane?'   (btw the video was Shane was worried he was sick with covid and manny called out make uprevolution for the copy of his highlighter). I take all his video titles with a huge grain of salt.

The issue is that Jafar is showing people ""evidence"" that someone was assaulted as some sort of gotcha or \~tea. Whether its credible or not, doing something like that is absolutely disgusting. However, this is right up Jafar's alley and I think what she's saying is 100% possible. 

So, that makes me wonder, who else did Jafar show this video to, who is else is complicit for knowing this is out there but not saying/doing anything?? It definitely puts Tati's video in a new light."

4204,2020-06-29 10:12:47,hh8xbg,Lmao
4205,2020-06-28 12:27:22,hh8xbg,This entire story is going to pick up so much more traction now that the Smith‚Äôs are tweeting about it. There‚Äôs so many people seeing those tweets that have no fucking idea who Shane is and they‚Äôre about to find out..
4206,2020-06-28 12:26:55,hh8xbg,I wonder if Shane still thinks he can make that movie?  ü§îü§≠üçø
4207,2020-06-30 02:59:18,hh8xbg,well no shit it‚Äôs Jaden Smith
4208,2020-06-29 15:44:39,hh8xbg,Yeah I feel like that is the entire point of a megathread. To have it all collected in one place. Also it would provide a timeline of events.

4211,2020-06-30 00:30:43,hh8xbg,The only good thing out of this shit is I‚Äôm SO glad Peter has been getting so much love and support lately!!
4212,2020-06-30 00:39:08,hh8xbg,Dad AF
4213,2020-06-30 00:20:32,hh8xbg,That I can't hear you I'm in a dark place had me dying
4214,2020-06-30 00:19:48,hh8xbg,"hey you guys, it's peter"
4215,2020-06-30 00:41:59,hh8xbg,"I‚Äôve honestly found comfort and it‚Äôs felt less ‚Äòdrama‚Äô as he hasn‚Äôt seemed to be overzealous in just reacting to what‚Äôs happening. Even watching his Starbucks reviews on the other channel, I can zone out :)"
4216,2020-06-30 01:12:04,hh8xbg,"I‚Äôm laughing that we all kinda stumbled on peter at the same time. I never used to watch him,  it then when I did I realized he would voice his opinions in a respectful manner. I think the video that got me was one where he voiced my exact thoughts on the bye sister scandal after things were cooling down: either jeffree and Tati are covering up for a predator or jeffree and Tati falsely accused james of being a predator. 

It bothered him on the level of being a human being and having conflicting emotions. It wasn‚Äôt just tea."

4218,2020-06-28 15:05:20,hh8xbg,Holy shit it has never occurred to me until this moment that Jaden and Willow's names are just versions of their parents' names.
4219,2020-06-28 19:37:40,hh8xbg,"I honestly do think this is the take away BW wants everyone to have as well. That Jaffar is legit running around like a goddamn mob boss threatening people. I mean we knew but it‚Äôs good to finally get further clarification tbh. 

And yes I am aware that Blaire is problematic. I will say though I found her sincere in the video. She genuinely seemed distressed about sitting on this info, and feeling all sorts of ways because she is a rape victim herself. 

Idk idk this shit is getting wilder and wilder. At this point dramageddon 3 needs to be called Youtube is a flaming pile of garbage."
4220,2020-06-28 19:27:20,hh8xbg,Can I steal Jarjar Stanks as a flair please
4221,2020-06-28 19:36:49,hh8xbg,That's what baffles me. He has shown it to multiple people. How is that normal or okay?
4222,2020-06-28 23:29:23,hh8xbg,tbh I am debating creating a twitter account just to spectate bc my brain cannot imagine what fandom wars would look like
4223,2020-06-28 23:15:27,hh8xbg,if you want to barf visit /r/positivelyshane . Denial is strong there
4224,2020-06-29 07:45:33,hh8xbg,"I think he's trying to show that he's unbothered by all this and ""living my best life"". 

Shane is in so much shit (rightfully so) and his ""family member"" janky stanky is busy celebrating birthdays."
4225,2020-06-29 09:29:31,hh8xbg,"Wait, there's a Dramageddon website? Since when? And here I am just refreshing the megathreads for updates.

And the grandma post is just sloppy. He can't find a different photo he's never posted?"
4226,2020-06-29 09:45:31,hh8xbg,"I think about this a lot. I don't think he's entirely all there. Most 'evil' people don't believe they're bad and they're able to justify any behaviours they know are wrong:

* I'm not threatened by JC, he's a dangerous predator and it's my duty to protect his fans

* I'm not being cruel, I'm just being honest

* I'm not racist, I was in a dark place and lashed out 

* I didn't use Dahvie for fame, I'm just too trusting and loving, it's other people like Dahvie who take advantage of my forgiving nature

etc

I'd love to see a psychologists breakdown of Jeffree to understand how he thinks. I reckon his chronic (badum-tsch) weed smoking massively contributes to his paranoia as well. Heavy use is linked with triggering schizophrenia and pyschosis and I think Jeffree's environment and personality puts him at high risk of some kind of mental break. He has a bizarre persecution complex: it's not normal to think everyone is out to get you and to keep recordings of your friends because you expect them to turn on you."
4227,2020-06-29 12:16:36,hh8xbg,"Lie down with dogs, wake up with fleas."
4228,2020-06-29 11:54:05,hh8xbg,"That's a shame because I actually really like them both. Whether that makes me a bad person for supporting them, idk"
4229,2020-06-30 02:56:37,hh8xbg,"Wow, earlier today I decided to investigate and found some disturbing photos which I screenshot. After seeing your comment about him deleting posts, I went back and looked for the posts I screenshot and sure enough, deleted. I posted them on r/ShaneDawson."
4230,2020-06-30 03:46:54,hh8xbg,"hopefully he got rid of that one of an underage girl thanking him for teaching her what a blowjob was that her family asked him to take down

Or maybe a bunch of ppl reported a bunch and he didn't delete them but they got removed, oh wait, Insta wouldn't do that"
4231,2020-06-30 02:23:27,hh8xbg,"Lol, that‚Äôs like pouring a thimbleful of water on a blazing inferno, but hey, he probably needs something to do right now other than contemplate the complete obliteration of his career."
4232,2020-06-28 06:39:03,hh8xbg,The shane dawson subreddit has always been full of people disappointed in shane since the conspiracy palette happened.
4233,2020-06-28 06:14:59,hh8xbg,LMAOOO it's like onion boy reddit now???
4234,2020-06-28 06:19:12,hh8xbg,"I heard a rumour that the jeffreestar reddit, not the jfcosmetics reddit went private. I say rumour cause I think it was in like megathread 2 and things are getting fuzzy.

but the jsc reddit will likely remain willfully ignorant"
4235,2020-06-28 06:37:00,hh8xbg,"I went there to check out a post on Garrett and tiktok and was surprised to see posts calling his shit out as well as neutral or devils advocate posts had literally ZERO comments, like crickets."
4236,2020-06-28 11:10:03,hh8xbg,"That‚Äôs something people don‚Äôt fully comprehend. You can entirely cancel Shame and delete his YT channel but the power we(everyone who saw at least one mini series, that bought his palette, etc.) gave him, meaning wealth it‚Äôs never going away; he‚Äôs got the money already and the way things work in this world his money can only multiply making investments and he can live a wealthy, lavish life in a huge village somewhere in the European countryside(lol) for many many years to come"
4237,2020-06-28 10:55:11,hh8xbg,"His retailers might be returning unsold stocks because of the scandal. And he is actually suffering financial consequences - he used to get away being controversial as long as he brings in the money. Not so much anymore now. 

I'm surprised we haven't heard more BGs deleting reviews of his palette, remove themselves from PR and pledge to not support his products in the future."
4238,2020-06-28 11:44:21,hh8xbg,The Smiths will make sure he never works in Hollywood. His movie will never be made. His film career is over before it‚Äôs even started.
4239,2020-06-28 14:32:23,hh8xbg,"As it should I feels so sorry for that family all we need is willow and will smith to speak if will smith speak it will truly be over of Shane it be like mortal Kombat

4243,2020-06-29 02:21:36,hh8xbg,To just keep filling the deep dark hole in his achingly empty chest with the ego boost he gets from abusing his power and controlling and manipulating people.
4244,2020-06-29 02:15:19,hh8xbg,"I don't really think he has one... I think he just wants to take down anyone who tries to take ""his place"" because of pure jealousy. He is a hateful person, he will react to anyone that ""threatens"" him in a hateful way. It's like a train wreck. He will destroy anyone that comes in his way. It's really sick and twisted."
4245,2020-06-29 02:59:37,hh8xbg,"Honestly, I think he just enjoys chaos....I think he does want to be on top but at the same time he loves to destroy people."
4246,2020-06-29 02:22:43,hh8xbg,The iron throne...
4247,2020-06-29 02:08:22,hh8xbg,maybe he's going deep into the identity of a clown as a method actor to play the role of the joker.
4248,2020-06-29 03:17:57,hh8xbg,"In that podcast interview he did he said he's writing an autobiography and wants to be a NYT bestselling author. He also mentioned having a list of ten things he wants to accomplish, that's one of them"
4249,2020-06-29 02:41:40,hh8xbg,"it's like the story of the scorpion and the frog. all of this vileness, backstabbing and one-upping is just his nature."
4250,2020-06-29 11:22:21,hh8xbg,"Yeah I‚Äôve seen a lot of people say that either Blaire is being manipulated by Jeffree, either she‚Äôs aware of it and is trying to get the heat off Shane. A lot of people are not willing to drag James through the mud just based on some rumors without proof and I totally agree with this. Plus, in the mom‚Äôs basement podcast, Jeffree said that the voice memo was from a third party, not the victim and that he wasn‚Äôt even sure how credible it was. Now, Blaire made it seem like the voice memo was from the victim herself. So which is it ?? On top of that, I‚Äôm not about to take what these two lying racists have to say at face value. Hell no !"
4251,2020-06-29 10:31:17,hh8xbg,Yeah it‚Äôs kind of like the boy who played wolf with the James allegations after last year. Put up or shut up kind of thing with that.
4252,2020-06-29 10:50:23,hh8xbg,"Yeah because it's the exact same thing Jabba the Slut came up with a year ago against James and nobody has come forth with hard proof ever since.
James made his video with full receipts, everyone suddenly shut up and moved on.

Meanwhile there's a truckload of unending proof against Shame and Jabba so I'm glad this diversion didn't land."
4253,2020-06-29 10:29:45,hh8xbg,"It does seem that way. Good, lets hope more people see it for what it is."
4254,2020-06-29 10:53:46,hh8xbg,"It might've worked, I think, if we were still talking about Shane's leaving the beauty community tweets/tati/etc, but then Jenna Marbles posted her video, Shane posted his bad apology in response, and now everything's way bigger than just beauty guru drama."
4255,2020-06-28 06:59:21,hh8xbg,"If you can, check their ages. Are they under 18? Maybe between 12 and 16? Bc that‚Äôs the age I was when I wanted to be grown up and thought I was ready for sex and stuff, and dreamed about musicians you know? And I got in terrible spots and idk if my pics from when I was 14 and flat are still circulating or not. 

Kids, if you‚Äôre reading this: don‚Äôt do stuff with older people. Don‚Äôt give your idols (or your crush) pics of yourself. Don‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt give out any personal info. Always use a nickname. Don‚Äôt do anything until you‚Äôre really ready, with a loving partner that you trust. Just don‚Äôt. No means no. Always.

Sorry for sharing my life story here but...you know. If I can save one person from what I went through, then it‚Äôs worth this openness and embarrassment."
4256,2020-06-28 08:59:31,hh8xbg,"He reposted pride looks from black muas, two of which used James Charles palette. L. O. L."
4257,2020-06-28 09:44:34,hh8xbg,He's already moving on to the next friend to ruin!!
4258,2020-06-28 09:11:17,hh8xbg,Jefree is such a bad friend. Just watching shane fall
4259,2020-06-28 08:52:51,hh8xbg,"he said ""bad friend and insecure"" not that makes it better but..."
4260,2020-06-28 23:36:57,hh8xbg,LOL Nice
4261,2020-06-28 23:42:16,hh8xbg,"Its nice to see that some influencers really are not stupid with their platform like so many others, Its almost like they are aware that they have millions of followers. I like them, they seem like nice boys"
4262,2020-06-28 23:53:38,hh8xbg,Are they copying billie eilish?
4263,2020-06-29 00:00:43,hh8xbg,my 60 year old mother in law just messaged me. Oh uh.
4264,2020-06-28 23:49:33,hh8xbg,"My fiance, who had prior no clue who Shane or Jeffree are- has now started asking me ‚ÄúWhat did Shane and Jeffree do today?!?‚Äù Because I‚Äôve been glued to the commentary channels."
4265,2020-06-28 23:49:23,hh8xbg,Oh sh\*t.
4266,2020-06-28 23:48:20,hh8xbg,Y i k e s !
4267,2020-06-29 12:30:06,hh8xbg,I always felt like Manny‚Äôs apology was sincere. Especially where he has shown growth. But with Jeffree I feel like he will always be this way because for some reason his fans think he can do no wrong. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
4268,2020-06-29 13:06:55,hh8xbg,"Jeffree‚Äôs cult members went after Manny, and he has a big cult. He sicced his dogs on Manny. That‚Äôs all it takes."
4269,2020-06-29 12:20:22,hh8xbg,"Its like he really has dirt on people or something. Are there more racist guru's who said shit and he recorded it or has proof of it? I am more inclined to believe it, because if you are a big guru why not come out? You have your stans unless you know he will release what he has and you will lose everything."
4270,2020-06-29 12:43:28,hh8xbg,"I think what's happening is even better than a mass loss of subscribers all at once. They're slowly bleeding subs and will probably continue to do so.

Let's face it, a lot of Jerky Squirt's subs are only subbing to see if he's going to come out with some sort of apology video ala Shameson. Most of the comments in most of his videos are pretty negative.

And the unsubs are pretty regular and, while not as much as Jame's three-day dump, is still pretty big. Shameson is losing about 100K-200K per day for the past week-ish. Jerky Squirt has been losing about 100K per day for about that same amount of time.

IMO, people are only subbed to watch the ship burn. They're going to steadily lose subs as time goes on and more comes out. The people left over are going to be 12-year-olds whose parents have no idea how bad these people are."
4271,2020-06-29 13:17:28,hh8xbg,"why was manny cancelled? i remember the huge wave of not liking him and calling him a social climber, but why was he cancelled?"
4272,2020-06-28 12:49:21,hh8xbg,"I think its students procrastinating studying and younger students being out for summer, so having a lot more free time and emotions for online drama.

Personally I think the mass canceling of 2020 was caused by miss Rona. We are all indoors, with nothing to do, and a lot of mixed emotions about the state of the world. Most of the human race being indoors and online right now is definitely contributing to the wave of cancellations."
4273,2020-06-28 12:33:56,hh8xbg,"Yes, they all happen when I have my damn exams I swear I‚Äôm a diligent student the whole entire year but OF COURSE drama season coincides with my exams

No but srsly, it‚Äôs probably because in summer people pay less attention to real life and work so they turn to the internet?"
4274,2020-06-28 15:54:11,hh8xbg,I know it‚Äôs never been confirmed; but it seems Jevfefe has some sort of financial stake in Morphe. I‚Äôd be surprised if they cut ties.
4275,2020-06-28 15:52:43,hh8xbg,"Jeffree said once he partly invested in morphe

4277,2020-06-28 16:06:56,hh8xbg,"2014, 6 years ago is really not that long ago... Shane would‚Äôve been 25 at the time."
4278,2020-06-28 15:59:43,hh8xbg,"It looks like Shane's popularity is gonna bring a loooot of people down because in that video, it was the other two (I think their names are Nikki and Steve) who came up with the game idea where they try to ""roast nice people"" and added his name into there which I truly do not understand at all"
4279,2020-06-28 15:59:21,hh8xbg,"in case anyone is wondering, [here's the compilation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pL6KeVUuSI)"

4284,2020-06-28 16:57:37,hh8xbg,"That would be impressive if J\* planned all this. He's probably laughing in his mansion. I wish this Shane energy could be extended to him too. He's literally the reason this whole thing got started, because he couldn't keep Shane's name out of his mouth."
4285,2020-06-28 16:54:22,hh8xbg,"Wait for Blaire ‚òïÔ∏è 

New video in an hour, according to her twitter"
4286,2020-06-28 17:25:35,hh8xbg,"It's real fucked up of him to be spreading it like that. As a survivor of assault, I'd feel like shit if I knew the people I told were treating it like petty gossip."
4287,2020-06-28 17:36:18,hh8xbg,Javier Serpentine is my favorite nickname so far omg
4288,2020-06-28 17:39:10,hh8xbg,I hope he does it.
4289,2020-06-28 19:30:16,hh8xbg,This other YouTuber mentioned in the video might be preying on their next victim as we speak. It's gutwrenching
4290,2020-06-28 20:45:24,hh8xbg,After he called dahvie a predator he went on tour with him and called him his brother soooo ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
4291,2020-06-28 20:56:45,hh8xbg,He was probably trying to fuck with his head. He gets off on abusing people‚Äôs mental state.
4292,2020-06-28 20:40:47,hh8xbg,Judas' playbook is to befriend people before he attempts to destroy them. I think he was tossing out a lure to see if he could draw James back in because I'm sure Judas didn't expect James to bounce back as successfully as he did.
4293,2020-06-28 20:55:58,hh8xbg,Aparently AFTER that tweet is when he was shit talking him again on the podcast
4294,2020-06-28 21:46:24,hh8xbg,"Right? I don‚Äôt believe anything that comes out of that losers mouth. He‚Äôs literally been trying every angle to take James down, it‚Äôs psychopathic."
4295,2020-06-28 21:15:39,hh8xbg,"I just don't understand it - Jarjar CLEARLY offered Banks to listen to the memo on the podcast off the record. ???
Who are they tryna fool?"
4296,2020-06-28 21:14:57,hh8xbg,Racists will always cape for each other. I don't trust Keem either
4297,2020-06-28 21:18:56,hh8xbg,"Why does anyone even want Keemstar's thoughts on anything?

He's literally in the middle of a crusade defending self-admitted Twitch sexual harassers."
4298,2020-06-28 21:15:57,hh8xbg,"Meaning he claimed on air that he had proof and would show it, then couldn't follow through. How *curious*"
4299,2020-06-28 21:14:06,hh8xbg,"...what???? 
...the???
...fuck???"
4300,2020-06-28 22:14:22,hh8xbg,But he literally told him in the podcast to listen to it in the back. They‚Äôre all a bunch of liars
4301,2020-06-28 21:26:40,hh8xbg,Exactly. You‚Äôd think if they spoke and verified whatever that she would‚Äôve mentioned it TBH.
4302,2020-06-28 21:29:11,hh8xbg,"Yep, thats exactly what I have been saying. Her statement was less than useless. She doesn't state if they replied at all. That video was carefully orchestrated. Personally, I think by Jafar himself."
4303,2020-06-28 21:46:14,hh8xbg,Dont blame her. I was thinking earlier if I had kids I'd never let anyone see them after the last few days.
4304,2020-06-28 23:43:27,hh8xbg,"If they do not know whether the voice note is real, the topic should should not even be up for discussion. Sexual assault/misconduct allegations are very serious and can ruin someone‚Äôs life if false - as we have supposedly seen with James last year. 

However if the voice note is true, Jovfefe should not be the one who gets to share it, it is the victims story and they get to decide if they would like to approach the police or not. It isn‚Äôt some ‚Äútea‚Äù Junglebitch Scarface gets to spill to his audience or other influencers."
4305,2020-06-28 23:35:14,hh8xbg,"Her video was along the same lines as what he said, which is that it sounds credible. The whole issue is that unless someone sees what went down or there's physical evidence, these sorts of claims are always the word of one party against another."
4306,2020-06-29 01:20:32,hh8xbg,Trixie Mattel is a flop for STILL not cutting Jeffree off
4307,2020-06-29 01:34:09,hh8xbg,"It's nice to see somebody call themselves out, denounce him, and spread the good word about basic morality and that Jefferson Starship is trash. Staying quiet and leaving vids is not okay- silence and leaving up a video is condoning his bigotry and blatant disregard for others or decency. This whole thing has been awful to watch but it's really reassuring to see people do good even if it is hard or not in their best interests (like Jenna)."
4308,2020-06-29 01:15:35,hh8xbg,"I think this will definitely impact how influencers are perceived. It‚Äôs not like people had a good opinion of influencers to begin with, but people were starting accept that influencers are here to stay before this happened. But this might start to reverse that.

4309,2020-06-29 01:11:06,hh8xbg,I was literally just thinking earlier that this is the start of influencers losing influence therefore causing them to become irrelevant in the internet sphere.
4310,2020-06-29 01:13:55,hh8xbg,I really think this is an interesting time to look at parasocial relationships.  I‚Äôm interested in where this goes and what this means for other larger creators.

4338,2020-06-28 22:49:44,hh8xbg,"Shane posts so infrequently I'm not sure how many people are really fans, if that makes sense. I'm sure there are tons of people who subscribed during a series and then forgot they were following."

Shane did a really good job at convincing his audience that he's genuine and relatable, ya know ""I'm so poor, I don't get sponsors"" so people feel more connected to him."
4341,2020-06-29 00:04:31,hh8xbg,"A large part of his audience is built ON the content he is currently catching heat for. It's no wonder he isn't getting as much pushback when it resurfaces, a bunch of people are probably going like ""hnnngh, that was funny in 2010"""

meanwhile no actual energy for these 2 clowns doing much much worse."
4352,2020-06-29 22:36:22,hh8xbg,lol he called out peter monn for using a fan that he got from the ABH alyssa edwards release. That's called projection.

4359,2020-06-30 02:22:38,hh8xbg,Sanders said he reached out to other companies who partnered with Shane. He broke the story about Target dropping Shane's books. There's probably a lot more to follow.
4360,2020-06-30 02:12:18,hh8xbg,When are they not lol
4361,2020-06-30 02:42:01,hh8xbg,Love your flair!
4362,2020-06-30 03:48:15,hh8xbg,"It's in relation to a tweet by Sanders (??) Where Shane admits to having nightmares about people stealing his computer and then he goes on to say that if someone did steal his computer they'd have a lot of blackmail against him. 

A lot think he meant child porn but it could also just be nudes or some weird kink.


ETA It's in Sanders new video at 11 minutes in and NM he could definitely mean childporn because Shane also says ""I'm surprised I haven't been on To Catch a Predator""

https://youtu.be/cbKNzRIp_GM"
4363,2020-06-28 21:42:11,hh8xbg,I'm inclined towards 3 lol
4364,2020-06-29 05:36:25,hh8xbg,Oh that makes me cringe knowing that he'd pick that name in the first place. Imagine being a loved one of one of a serial killer's victims and having a famous person make a tongue-in-cheek username to be funny. Fuck that.
4365,2020-06-29 05:28:20,hh8xbg,So he's quietly cleaning shop. Any deleted videos? This may be precurser to another jenna apology video ripoff..
4366,2020-06-29 05:41:37,hh8xbg,"That username is extra uncomfortable when you consider some of the darker allegations made against him. Like the 'butcher knife' incident and the revenge website. Also, Dahmer predominantly preyed on members the black community, so there's that too :/"
4367,2020-06-29 05:09:11,hh8xbg,Yeah. Ok so maybe he‚Äôs hired a PR team finally?
4368,2020-06-29 06:40:39,hh8xbg,Remember he has a tattoo of Jon Benet Ramsey. Her story supposedly had an impact on him or something.
4369,2020-06-29 05:06:41,hh8xbg,Omg you can change snapchat usernames now?? Where have I been
4370,2020-06-29 16:52:47,hh8xbg,I know that Jaclyn and her friends had actually been trying to help her for quite some time before shane made the video and was upset because she didn‚Äôt want this to ruin it
4371,2020-06-29 17:05:14,hh8xbg,"Kati Morton is another problematic character on yt. She was seen shilling out for a scam online 'therapy' app that actually does not put you in contact with professionals and in terms and agreement (which most people don't read) the app admits that what it offers does not qualify as therapy/counselling. Once you fell for the scam and signed up for it, it's really hard to cancel the subscription so they keep leaching onto your bank account (big yikes). ALSO, she's a family relationship therapist, she has no qualifications to be advising anyone how to deal with ED. It's really disgusting how he also had her to help diagnose Jake Paul once you realize how poorly qualified she actually is."
4372,2020-06-29 17:14:09,hh8xbg,"I remember when Jaclyn made a video right after Shane‚Äôs Eugenia series where she was explaining how she was the one to get Eugenia help and basically she slight on how bad her situation was, I remember being in the minority of people who agreed Shane was exploitative and didn‚Äôt seem to genuinely care :/"
4373,2020-06-29 18:33:47,hh8xbg,She‚Äôs not a psychologist. She‚Äôs a LMFT. And I definitely agree her credentials should be under review by the California board.
4374,2020-06-28 06:30:14,hh8xbg,Even anonymous retweeted a thread about himüëÄ
4375,2020-06-28 06:35:50,hh8xbg,My favorite leftist accounts and anon accounts are tweeting him it's gone full mainstream lol he's totally done
4376,2020-06-29 07:47:14,hh8xbg,Garrett was too unproblematic for Shane's taste.
4377,2020-06-29 07:49:40,hh8xbg,"Lord, if Garrett & Drew actually make a statement üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨"
4378,2020-06-29 09:55:31,hh8xbg,Can we claim Garret as our own?
4379,2020-06-29 18:35:58,hh8xbg,"I'm 100% convinced that Jenna Marbles leaving youtube changed the drama game completely. Because even people who don't follow beauty gurus know who Jenna Marbles is, and a lot of her fans are extremely, extremely upset that she left but J\* and Shane are still here, so they're digging through the back catalogue for dirt on those two in a way I think they didn't anticipate. That's why Blaire's video feels like so much old news."
4380,2020-06-29 18:55:47,hh8xbg,I think it would have happened regardless just maybe next week not this. That letter was so incredibly stupid and smug though so I'm glad he released it.
4381,2020-06-29 18:18:27,hh8xbg,It‚Äôs been brewing for a while. There‚Äôs been videos going round of Shane for a few weeks now.
4382,2020-06-29 18:26:19,hh8xbg,"That‚Äôs how I feel. The only thing is that Jeffree was stirring the pot for some reason with the moms basement podcast, congratulating James on Twitter... he wanted something to happen and I don‚Äôt think this was what was supposed to happen but I‚Äôm also not sure if it‚Äôs still on track on what he wanted to happen"
4383,2020-06-29 18:44:36,hh8xbg,He talks too much.
4384,2020-06-28 06:53:03,hh8xbg,Sanders Kennedy has hinted at a big video of his in the works.
4385,2020-06-28 12:22:14,hh8xbg,I‚Äôd love to see this. Let them both cancel each other out üíÄ
4386,2020-06-28 18:57:20,hh8xbg,Yup!! You got it right.
4387,2020-06-28 21:16:54,hh8xbg,Me too. I‚Äôve burnt 0 calories all day glued to my phone so I can be updated with the drama. I was really counting on Blair‚Äôs video.

4389,2020-06-28 21:16:20,hh8xbg,I feel this on a personal level
4390,2020-06-28 21:16:51,hh8xbg,"My shitty workout routine has been ruined with the drama, this is my guilty pleasure"
4391,2020-06-28 21:38:50,hh8xbg,Why haven't ppl reported it to instagram to get it removed? Can't you report a picture for involving a minor under the nude/sexual whatever category?
4392,2020-06-29 08:50:59,hh8xbg,I want to see how jafar actually reacts behind closed doors when such a controversy happens. On the surface he pretends to be confident and unbothered. Wondering if that's an act he puts up to look strong or he's really like that.
4393,2020-06-29 08:25:06,hh8xbg,Plus posting that old picture of him on the plane to try and play off the whole unbothered thing. Looks desperate almost
4394,2020-06-29 09:09:54,hh8xbg,"Some people think he‚Äôs already forgotten but the truth is he‚Äôs walking on very thin ice right now. With how recent his friendship with Shane was & how Shane‚Äôs own karmageddon ended up having its own crazy plot twists Jeffree knows he has to be extremely careful of what he‚Äôll do next. This isn‚Äôt something he could easily brush off, plus he doesn‚Äôt have any ‚Äúfriends‚Äù left that could shield him or make him look good this time. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs so quiet."
4395,2020-06-29 14:46:37,hh8xbg,What did it say?
4396,2020-06-29 15:10:33,hh8xbg,"Yeah this is officially impossible to find anything in, soooooo many comments"
4397,2020-06-29 14:54:18,hh8xbg,I‚Äôm guessing not until another major thing happens
4398,2020-06-29 16:57:03,hh8xbg,Im wondering how many megathreads we will have until we get a response from Jc or tati or grayson....megathread 102 at the rate we are going
4399,2020-06-30 02:53:11,hh8xbg,"Bruh. He really did serve himself a slice of humble pie *at least* as large as JC's, didn't he? Played himself with that one."
4400,2020-06-30 02:34:36,hh8xbg,Good night! I hope you get a good sleep. ‚ù§Ô∏è
4401,2020-06-28 13:30:31,hh8xbg,"Oh I've thought about this a million times since his video. The clownery of it all, the caucasity honey!"
4402,2020-06-28 06:11:54,hh8xbg,"In one of the Inked ""tattoo artist reacts"" videos they reacted to youtuber tattoos and Jeffree was one of the examples. Each artist basically said something along the lines of ""good tats but he's racist."" so it's a start."
4403,2020-06-28 05:48:44,hh8xbg,Absolutely.  Neither will be making $30 mil (or however much it was) from shitty palettes ever again
4404,2020-06-28 06:26:59,hh8xbg,There‚Äôs enough really predatory and creepy behavior of Shane around children for him to get cancelled.
4405,2020-06-28 06:35:47,hh8xbg,i‚Äôm pretty sure this is going to completely kill shane‚Äôs career. i don‚Äôt think he can come back from this
4406,2020-06-28 06:54:19,hh8xbg,"Agreed. Especially since he didn‚Äôt drop J* completely, I don‚Äôt even like seeing him anymore."

4408,2020-06-29 03:21:20,hh8xbg,">Shame Dogshit 

THese nicknames are killing me LMAO"
4409,2020-06-29 01:25:06,hh8xbg,"Yeah, if he really felt he deserved to lose his platform/career he would delete, or at the very least, demonetise all his videos. His actions speak louder than his words."
4410,2020-06-29 01:40:17,hh8xbg,"Possible stupid question, but when you delete views, do you have to return the money made by those videos to YT?"
4411,2020-06-29 01:58:06,hh8xbg,"I though someone had mentioned earlier that he was just making them private, but not delete them? Not sure if it matters either way though, I guess."

4413,2020-06-29 04:50:20,hh8xbg,Ya like black content creators who worked with him literally said he‚Äôs racist and no one cared back then
4414,2020-06-29 05:13:50,hh8xbg,I wonder how different the public outrage would have been should it be RBK or Sam R (for example) that was disrespected?
4415,2020-06-28 15:16:41,hh8xbg,"At this point it has gone past just YouTuber drama anyways. It's Sunday, there's a pandemic and I am taking a nap. I will absolutey check this thread as soon as I open my eyes. üòÇ"
4416,2020-06-28 15:16:44,hh8xbg,"It‚Äôs not drama though, like, we‚Äôre waiting and watching for a racist predator to be deplatformed."
4417,2020-06-28 15:08:35,hh8xbg,Lmao sammmme. I like to think that I enjoy this drama to avoid creating any drama in my own life. It fills the drama sized hole in my heart
4418,2020-06-28 15:04:41,hh8xbg,Hahaha preach!!!!
4419,2020-06-28 15:40:39,hh8xbg,Also keeping me from thinking about the recession and potential second wave of the pandemic.

No one of a large platform has been willing to call him out yet. Maybe Blaire's video will change that but I doubt it."
4424,2020-06-28 11:59:08,hh8xbg,For real. This turned into a Shane Is a scapegoat and now Jstarfish is safe again. Like  this orchestrated by Starfish it feels like.

Your post reminded me of a Miranda Sings video (a few years ago) Kory bought ""Miranda"" stuff from Taco Bell, she would proceed to take bites and chew on it then suddenly spit everything out because there's a tomato in it and she hates tomatoes. A grown ass woman, spitting out chewed out food with saliva mixed in. It was disgusting. Are children supposed to be watching that???

4438,2020-06-30 03:50:07,hh8xbg,Thanks!
4439,2020-06-28 20:19:17,hh8xbg,This is kinda random but I‚Äôve never seen anyone just call him Jeff before and it‚Äôs really funny to me for some reason
4440,2020-06-28 06:11:17,hh8xbg,I mean but Shane didn‚Äôt really speak up for Jefree. All he said and I‚Äôm paraphrasing is Jefree is a piece of crap but I still love him like family. Which I take as like you can‚Äôt choose your family even those ones that are shite but you still have to love em as blood. Which I don‚Äôt subscribe to in any case. I‚Äôve divorced myself from toxic family members even the blood ones.
4441,2020-06-28 05:50:21,hh8xbg,"As disgusted with both of them as I am J* would get extra points in my books for trying to ‚Äòdrop‚Äô Shane. Lay in the bed you made and stop treating people as transactions. That would be the opposite of accountability.

I only mention that because Sanders Kennedy‚Äôs video with J*‚Äôs deleted comment under Shane‚Äôs video literally unhinged my jaw out of pure shock (probably a different mega thread, but still)."
4442,2020-06-28 11:45:00,hh8xbg,Its just a walmart version of Jenna‚Äôs apology. A PR move gone wrong
4443,2020-06-28 12:02:18,hh8xbg,It's actually insulting that he said he was inspired by Jenna's video. Jenna took accountability for her past and named specific things she's done. Shane learned nothing from Jenna's apology.
4444,2020-06-28 16:05:54,hh8xbg,All he needs to do now is properly piss off the kpop stans
4445,2020-06-28 16:07:38,hh8xbg,"I said this in the thread yesterday when Kid Cudi was retweeting Jaden, the hip hop community in general is gonna get involved. A lot of rappers publicly love Jaden and hate black face. Now you've got Barbz in there? He's done.

Edit: yikes I saw the video he made about her and that shit is capital R *Racist*."

How can we accept the words of someone who is willing to sell out a SA victim to Jafar?"
4448,2020-06-28 23:40:04,hh8xbg,"Seems like a perfect excuse. Distance himself so when it's exposed that it's fake he can just say ""don't shoot the messenger"""
4449,2020-06-28 23:45:17,hh8xbg,Was this something he brought up during dramageddon last year? Or on the podcast he did? I‚Äôm just asking cause I don‚Äôt remember that. I was always under the impression that he obtained it directly from the alleged victim (by legal means or otherwise)
4450,2020-06-29 01:06:02,hh8xbg,"For anyone looking for this - listen to [Episode 7 of  Mom's Basement podcast with Keemstar and Faze Banks (timestamped at 45 min)](https://youtu.be/2joV6VX9aLE?t=45m0s).
It comes up again at 56 minutes in where he tries to explain what type of testimony it actually is.

Also these timestamps include Jeffree putting aaaaall the blame on Tati. I had missed that he completely puts last year's bullshit on her, as if he wasn't tweeting crap and sending threat texts directly to James. Jfc"
4451,2020-06-29 00:04:47,hh8xbg,Saving this comment because a lot of people are already condeming james with out the actual evidence and i dont even like james but i mean cmon we were wrong once

4460,2020-06-29 15:17:53,hh8xbg,"Well said! It's concerning how many people are now convinced James C is a rapist. We still have no proof whatsoever! 

Jeffree has most likely planned this to take the heat off of him."
4461,2020-06-29 14:55:04,hh8xbg,"100% exactly this. We absolutely CANNOT act as if this voice memo is real and factual without any proof of even a victim. 
If it is real and there is an actual victim, they should 100% be treated with respect and compassion. However, until we have that this is all hearsay. Hearsay from a VERY untrustworthy source at that."

4466,2020-06-29 15:06:48,hh8xbg,Shane‚Äôs subreddit is turning into a second Onision subreddit. I never thought that would happen üò≥
4467,2020-06-29 15:09:39,hh8xbg,One of their rules is literally to never say or post anything negative about Jumanji Shampoo and his supporters. It‚Äôs like a cult over there.
4468,2020-06-29 15:00:47,hh8xbg,"yeah, they delete everything except for ""ooooh my cremated palette just arrived, look at my grey eylids uwu!!"""

4470,2020-06-29 15:29:05,hh8xbg,A bunch of imbeciles over there I swear.
4471,2020-06-29 16:59:18,hh8xbg," voice memo? Who is she? She‚Äôs not real.

But really it‚Äôs bullshit and hearsay and until a alleged victim speaks up (because I won‚Äôt even buy that jeffufuh says he has it) I‚Äôm not gonna turn it around on James. This isn‚Äôt a case of someone coming forward and saying x person did something to them. It‚Äôs literally a rumoured source with evidence that may or may not exist."
4472,2020-06-29 16:52:08,hh8xbg,"Nope. I think Shane implied shit but I don't remember him outright saying he heard it. Even if he did though, that would just be 3 liars making claims without proof. 


Blaire lies on the regular so I'm not sure why I've seen people's opinions of James shift. She made an the video claiming to expose Jeffree but really she's just backing him up. 


Also they achieved their original goal, there are people back to addressing the James accusations as if they're real despite them providing 0 evidence. It's really gross.


It feels relevant to point out that there is no victim currently. There are Jeffree & Blaire claiming a victim exists but this isn't a ""believe the victim"" scenario. If there is a victim and they chose to come forward then we'll listen and come to our opinions from there, but what they've done is they've created this narrative that we have to listen to them with the implication that they are speaking for a victim that they haven't even proven exists."
4473,2020-06-29 17:06:32,hh8xbg,Rich Lux said he never heard the memo and that he only heard rumors of it.
4474,2020-06-29 16:48:40,hh8xbg,"Agreed. Also with all the other information Jeff was giving Ashley Kyle in advance last year you‚Äôd think we would‚Äôve showed her, right?"
4475,2020-06-29 16:57:04,hh8xbg,I‚Äôm fairly certain in Rich‚Äôs most recent video (I occasionally watch to see if he‚Äôs starting to jump off the bandwagon- kindaaaa seems like he might); and I‚Äôm fairly sure he said he hasn‚Äôt heard it
4476,2020-06-29 19:12:12,hh8xbg,So its just blaire confirming it exists? And no one trusts her.
4477,2020-06-28 06:52:44,hh8xbg,"I don't get how anyone could feel bad for them. Like the only ppl who would feel bad for these people are racists, pedos and fuck wits. Also they're literally millionaires lol... uwu won't someone think of the bourgeoisie"
4478,2020-06-28 23:18:13,hh8xbg,This.
4479,2020-06-28 07:19:56,hh8xbg,"This right here. He is doing the ""smart"" thing. Shane apologized and opened himself up to criticism. Jeffree is about to get a wave of backlash though."

4511,2020-06-29 03:33:20,hh8xbg,"Wow.  Just wow.  I am surprised he made it this long without facing consequences.  

I hope the cops take a look at these videos and can get a warrant to search his computers."

4513,2020-06-29 06:51:21,hh8xbg,Where does it end with this guy? Just endless videos  with disgusting content. How did he get away with this for so long? üòî
4514,2020-06-28 07:11:02,hh8xbg,"if this thing somehow turns into more james allegations it will truly have taken the darkest of turns. like, i might be done with the internet for a while"
4515,2020-06-28 12:50:50,hh8xbg,"Honestly Blaire is just as problematic as they are and she hardly ever has good intentions when getting into drama like this. IDK, it wouldn‚Äôt shock me if she went nuclear and shared every bit of dirt she‚Äôs ever had on anyone in the beauty community..."
4516,2020-06-28 07:43:50,hh8xbg,Honestly I‚Äôd be quite confused if she didn‚Äôt say anything against Shane. She‚Äôs very vocally against child grooming and a lot of the videos coming out with his cousin are quite appalling and I can‚Äôt imagine she could justify that behavior when she calls out people for far less egregious things.
4517,2020-06-28 07:07:37,hh8xbg,You know you fucked up when you got the Smiths mad

4524,2020-06-28 13:05:55,hh8xbg,I think he could if he is prepared to lose all his money. I don‚Äôt think for 1 sec all the footage filmed for the series doesn‚Äôt belong to Jeffree and cant be used without his permission and if used without his permission it would be at the cost of Shane being homeless
4525,2020-06-28 20:21:49,hh8xbg,"I would also love to watch them attack eachother but I get the feeling joffren is like a mimic, he surrounds himself with problematic people and around them acts only as problematic as they do that way when it inevitably comes to blows, they dont have anything on him that he doesn't have on them. Truthfully Nate is the only one I believe actually knows the 100% real deal about Johnfrier and who he is when everyone's gone and the curtains are drawn"

4531,2020-06-28 16:35:23,hh8xbg,He won't regret it - look at all the money he made because of joff. He could completely fade away from public life and still live very comfortably for the rest of his life off the money he made from the conspiracy palette plus the ad revenue from the series.

See, y'all just had to say shit was fizzling out. Last time we got Jaden, this time we get Morphe potentially ridding itself of Shane. The universe is also here for the tea, apparently.

EDIT: FWIW, this hitting mainstream media was probably more than enough for Morphe to pull the plug, at least for now."

4572,2020-06-30 03:52:07,hh8xbg,"When I go to Jeffree star cosmetic on the morphe website it doesn‚Äôt pop up. When I search conspiracy I get a picture but if I click on it I‚Äôm also getting the ‚Äúghosted‚Äù page. 

Very interesting. 

If Jeffree does own part of morphe, surely this wouldn‚Äôt of happened without him signing off on it right?"

4582,2020-06-28 23:11:35,hh8xbg,Rich Lux and Nick Snyder are way too biased towards Jeffree to not be on the payroll and it‚Äôs become glaringly obviously these past couple weeks

4585,2020-06-29 09:35:30,hh8xbg,"Yeah. And now whoever this person is has random people reaching out and pressuring them to come forward (Blaire White said she got in contact with them). It's fucked up on many levels. I think Peter Monn is right that Blaire played right into what Jeffree wanted. He wanted the info to get out, but didn't want to be the one to pull the trigger.

Edit: this is assuming there is a really a voice memo of someone accusing JC, and like many people have pointed out... I'm not gonna believe that until there's actual proof. Blaire White doing Jofrey Stonks dirty work is definitely not proof imo"
4586,2020-06-29 10:13:56,hh8xbg,I kind of hope it's all a lie because if its true someone went through something terrible and confided in someone who is now using it as drama. I hope if it's TRUE that person is surrounded by love and getting the support they need.
4587,2020-06-29 10:57:39,hh8xbg,"Yeah if it's true, then whoever the victim is has been failed so many times afterwards. First by the person that they confided in, who for some reason spilled the beans to Jeffree Star, the least trustworthy person on Youtube, who is now repeatedly using it as a weapon in a personal vendetta and is openly spreading that information to whoever it'll gain him favour with."
4588,2020-06-29 10:24:47,hh8xbg,">Assuming James Charles did molest someone, it was not Jeffree's place to weaponise the incident to take down a rival. 

the bright side to this, that's probably his last leverage he was waiting to hold on to till the last straw. he's still just waiting it out for the storm to pass"

If Is  remember right when they made the first video together, Garrett kind of knew that Shane was a YouTuber, but he didn't know his content well. It's at that time that Shane had already changed his humor on his videos so it's possible that Garrett didn't know the extent of it as Garrett has REALLY different kind of humor and videos. I also remember that when they hang out with Drew, he was the one to constantly admit that he didn't watch Shane videos cause he hated his content lol"
4653,2020-06-29 08:28:33,hh8xbg,It could be that Garrett believed Shane changed but then saw him either say nothing or participate when Jiggly Snot said racist things/slurs. Many people *allegedly* say he says overtly racists things when not on camera.
4654,2020-06-29 08:46:25,hh8xbg,"I think cause Shane has so many videos like 100s, there‚Äôs no way people could look back through all of them. He probably knew about the stuff Shane has apologised for but not everything"
4655,2020-06-29 09:21:11,hh8xbg,It's easy to dismiss problematic things about a friend who treats you very well. Shane has shown that he cared for Garrett. I remember when they helped him clean up his hoarding mess that pulled him out of a funk. Shane seems to be good at making people feel special. That's why some of his stans will die for him.

During many of the past YouTube controversies where you could see the subs climb and fall in real time, there were these weird upticks in subscribers that would offset those unsubscribing. It was regularly speculated that the Youtubers or their stans were buying subs to try to prevent people from bandwagon unsubbing. This was highlighted when their video views wouldn't increase during that time,  which is what would usually happen when you gain fresh subscribers.

**Edit:** clarification

To add to the above, there are also channels like Tati & Pewdiepie who both gained millions of followers and their views didn't really reflect it based on the amount they gained. Seems to have been a combination of the above and  people bandwagon subscribing without actual interest in the content. If you search up Pewdiepie there are forums and posts dedicated to showing people how to create fake accounts & buy followers to inflate his numbers."

4695,2020-06-29 03:20:52,hh8xbg,Grayson follows Jeffree still
4696,2020-06-29 08:46:55,hh8xbg,"They unfollowed everyone except each other, their channel and businesses and some fan accounts i think"
4697,2020-06-29 18:49:00,hh8xbg,The fact that they didn't last year when Jeffree's claims were proven false just speaks to how fake they are.
4698,2020-06-29 21:50:53,hh8xbg,"Yeah I really want to see all the dramatic editing and fake gasping and the ""Omg ME!!"" of all that's happening right now"
4699,2020-06-29 23:01:07,hh8xbg,Expect it in about six months.
4700,2020-06-28 17:39:33,hh8xbg,"Yup this.  Sounds like she just got caught up on this and Jafveve got her to turn the publics eyes against James AGAIN. How can J* have so much hate in his heart, especially considering, James debunked everything before? To me the only question is whether a) Blaire was manipulated b) she actually believes what she's saying... because c) it actually being true, seems unlikely"
4701,2020-06-28 17:35:44,hh8xbg,[removed]
4702,2020-06-28 17:35:08,hh8xbg,"Exactly, he showed the voice memos to everyone to see if someone says something, so he doesn't have to (he probably can't, since lawyers got involved)"
4703,2020-06-28 19:31:12,hh8xbg,"I doubt he will do this, and even if he did it probably won‚Äôt be enough to save himself, and will only serve to sink J* along with him.

But Shane has hours upon hours of footage. I remember around the time of the Jake Paul series, he tweeted a picture of external hard drives and said it was several terabytes worth of information. Surely he has SOMETHING incriminating on J*."
4704,2020-06-28 19:36:05,hh8xbg,Burn the bridge and go out swinging
4705,2020-06-28 19:45:57,hh8xbg,I don‚Äôt think Morgan‚Äôs career will be affected by this as long as she stays in CO. Ryland/Shane don‚Äôt have to work with all the money they have now and should just retire from the internet imo. The damage is far too bad to come back from this.
4706,2020-06-28 19:35:24,hh8xbg,I don't think that's his style. He's probably going to stay out of this
4707,2020-06-28 19:42:17,hh8xbg,"I believe for 100% Jeffree has made sure he has everything to lose, all his money"
4708,2020-06-28 20:15:31,hh8xbg,"Depends, he might have a clause in his contract that prevents him of speaking ill of j\*. Jeffree ain't stupid and has to have something in place."
4709,2020-06-28 07:05:59,hh8xbg,I'll take the rec. I youtube searched Shane Dawson and the results were all just Keemstar and Scarce. Mighty bold of someone with a history like Keemstar's to make a video about this....
4710,2020-06-28 06:56:23,hh8xbg,Absolutely
4711,2020-06-28 07:16:24,hh8xbg,What did he say??
4712,2020-06-28 07:49:26,hh8xbg,"I have no idea what‚Äôs been going on with Shane, but wasn‚Äôt Garret a close friend? What happened???"
4713,2020-06-28 07:17:46,hh8xbg,Omg what did he say?
4714,2020-06-28 07:14:04,hh8xbg,Haha yes!
4715,2020-06-28 11:23:33,hh8xbg,The rapper Cupcakke denounced him on twitter
4716,2020-06-28 11:26:28,hh8xbg,Loey Lane denounced him and Jeffree on twitter
4717,2020-06-28 13:36:26,hh8xbg,Yeah from Jenny Craig. Pretty sure he got a whole bunch of people fired
4718,2020-06-28 13:57:10,hh8xbg,Yeah afair he filmed a video inside a jenny Craig store worh other employees while they worked there and got fired for it
4719,2020-06-28 15:32:36,hh8xbg,Lol at Finance Ryland. Quite the Freudian slip. üëÄüòè
4720,2020-06-28 15:09:13,hh8xbg,Not really. If I were them I‚Äôd stay silent. What can they say that won‚Äôt cause people to attack them or make the situation worse? I can‚Äôt think of anything
4721,2020-06-28 15:01:50,hh8xbg,It's too raw. Anyone who comes forward is going to get eaten alive.
4722,2020-06-28 15:03:48,hh8xbg,you really can‚Äôt support the things he‚Äôs done without sounding like an idiot... they are probably just waiting it out
4723,2020-06-28 15:05:35,hh8xbg,"Shane‚Äôs family not only support him, his own aunt was in videos having little girls twerk their asses in front of her and Shane. So they‚Äôre just fine with it. They think he‚Äôs great."
4724,2020-06-28 15:43:46,hh8xbg,I feel there has to be PR people involved now and anyone close to Shane is being instructed on how to respond.
4725,2020-06-28 15:07:36,hh8xbg,"I‚Äôm hoping Shane has asked them not to so he can take all the heat. I genuinely like Morgan and Ryland (am currently assuming they have nothing problematic in their pasts) and I would hate for their names to be amidst all the google searches of ‚ÄúShane Dawson pedophile/racist/blackface.‚Äù

I know they need to be held accountable for their relationship but I also wonder how much they knew actually existed of his content. I watched Shane for years and have seen quite a bit in the past few days that I had never seen before."
4726,2020-06-28 15:14:39,hh8xbg,Ik!! I nearly threw up. Im so so disgusted
4727,2020-06-28 15:42:52,hh8xbg,I just went digging through YouTube to find it and I‚Äôm watching a report and I‚Äôm confused who watched these videos and thought they were funny......

4730,2020-06-28 15:24:42,hh8xbg,links?
4731,2020-06-28 15:29:10,hh8xbg,I don‚Äôt think anyone knows exactly when but he hasn‚Äôt really been around much since Shane did the second infomercial with Jafar.
4732,2020-06-28 16:08:16,hh8xbg,"Way before J*, Garrett and Shane started a joint company. It was going to be producing all of the merch and doing basically video content for everyone, I think. They got an office and renovated it.

Then it went nowhere. Morgan ended up moving into the office.

I'm assuming J* sort of steamrolled all those plans. That's all just wild speculation tho."
4733,2020-06-28 21:51:21,hh8xbg,"Hope your week get better, clowns stick together"
4734,2020-06-28 17:07:46,hh8xbg,It‚Äôs no coincidence that his two closets ‚Äòfriends‚Äô have been connected to doing inappropriate things with underage fans. Like not enough people are looking into that.
4735,2020-06-28 17:14:30,hh8xbg,"YAAAAS.

where the petitions at??"
4736,2020-06-28 17:25:42,hh8xbg,He just gifts everyone with sexual victim voice memos and a Birkin the first time they meet.
4737,2020-06-28 17:30:30,hh8xbg,We ARE the drama channels.
4738,2020-06-28 17:20:43,hh8xbg,"If that is true, J\* cannot hold on to that information as blackmail. It's immoral."

4740,2020-06-28 18:42:20,hh8xbg,Exactly. And people still wonder why it's rare for survivors to come forward.
4741,2020-06-28 18:55:36,hh8xbg,"Yeah, I watched the video and it's clear that that is her point. And tbh, setting aside whether or not the allegations are true, she's right about the base idea that it's shitty and gross and slimy as hell to take someone else's story and use it to benefit yourself. If this is supposed to somehow be an attempt to 'help' him I don't see how it does, he'd be further ahead just keeping silent."
4742,2020-06-28 18:52:22,hh8xbg,Doing him and Shane a favor by adding zero new information but diverting the conversation.
4743,2020-06-28 20:53:57,hh8xbg,The way he can scrub his whole YouTube page and still have problematic posts up to his ears...
4744,2020-06-28 20:54:14,hh8xbg,I lived in 2013. This was never okay... How did he get away with it? ü§¢
4745,2020-06-28 21:14:49,hh8xbg,At this point I am fatigued by the sheer amount of disgusting things that emerged in the past few days. I may need to take a break from all this.
4746,2020-06-28 21:09:18,hh8xbg,Omfg i cant anymore
4747,2020-06-28 21:21:39,hh8xbg,Omg does he not have a PR team? I can‚Äôt believe more and more just keeps coming out.
4748,2020-06-28 22:08:47,hh8xbg,"Same... In my opinion, they were thrown such a softball too and still managed to make it 100x worse by justifying it with ""context"" (despite the context not helping their case AT ALL). They literally followed Deflection 101 by saying ""I'm sorry that YOU were hurt"" instead of ""I'm sorry I was ignorant to create a challenge video where we thought jokes towards sensitive topics like Trayvon Martin were acceptable.""

Do Youtubers ever go through PR training? Taking accountability is not rocket science"
4749,2020-06-28 22:13:57,hh8xbg,I get the game they wanted to play but to put a name of a child who was murdered was still in poor taste on their part and his name should've never been in that pot. How shitty of them.
4750,2020-06-28 22:31:22,hh8xbg,"They didn't take responsibility at all, instead they blamed the viewers for getting offended. Steve said they took the video down because people were posting clips everywhere out of context, not because it was a horrible, shitty joke. 

What's worse is that Steve's blackout Tuesday picture had a white line at the bottom. People got upset at him, and Nikki replied to a comment and said ""he's not trolling, he doesn't know how to crop pictures well"". I've watched other videos of steve, he gives off edge lord vibes, and does offensive jokes in the name of trolling (he defended Trisha paytas' trans video as her just being a troll). I wouldn't be surprised if he intentionally put the white line at the bottom to be funny and edgy. These people are disgusting."

4753,2020-06-28 22:15:55,hh8xbg,I think you‚Äôre right. I‚Äôve been thinking the same thing. It‚Äôs not a coincidence he happens to be ‚Äúout of town‚Äù.
4754,2020-06-29 06:41:22,hh8xbg,When Shane tried to pass off not reading the reviews as a joke! Omg the man has not changed one iota.
4755,2020-06-29 08:40:01,hh8xbg,"The lyric videos are so annoying. Like-You are a big girl tati, use your words."

4757,2020-06-29 12:25:33,hh8xbg,I think the fear is that if you take legal action for blackmail you end up revealing what the blackmail is about.

The expose that he put up before all of this really picked up speed was well done & he approached it in a very academic way that really showcased his intelligence and (albeit immature) understanding of sociology.

4763,2020-06-29 19:11:16,hh8xbg,The problem is that boy gets too excited and could ruin it. His whole twitter thread is just that.

4765,2020-06-29 19:09:56,hh8xbg,Never watched the others but I love D‚Äôangelo‚Äôs videos. His  first video on Shane from a year ago is so spot on and I love the deadpan humor he used.
4766,2020-06-29 19:10:13,hh8xbg,Do you know around what time they usually post?

4769,2020-06-29 21:22:27,hh8xbg,"From the little I know about the publishing world, and just my experience as an acid bookshopper, publishers tend to pay bookstores to feature certain books and it never really lasts too long and there's a constant rotation of books.

This is literally just my opinion but what I reckon the deal involves is constantly featuring his book up front and prominently enough,alongside his merch. When in any other bookstore they'd have maybe a book on the shelves so people would need to actively look for it.

Considering how Shane keeps amassing new fans and target seems to be a very accessible store, he probably got a lot of passive/impulse buys pretty regularly and since it's a massive chain, it's a lot more that he's milking from a very specific/niche book. So that's a line of income that's gone."
4770,2020-06-29 20:57:23,hh8xbg,Keem definitely would have wanted to hear it. He has no morals and would want to hear it for the sake of drama and it's contents would already be leaked.
4771,2020-06-29 21:12:44,hh8xbg,"A combination of her past behavior regarding non white people, basically most everyone knows to ignore Jefferson now because of his shady history and his racism. So hey. Blaires down with the racists! Also he knew she would talk. Also shes popular enough but not TOO popular. She‚Äôs also a white woman. And a trans white woman. Both of those factors stick her into a more marginalized group then if he had showed it to a white cis male. 

Basically she‚Äôs a perfect storm of a shit stirrer who is a part of a number of marginalized groups and... shes a white woman which I‚Äôm betting more people will listen to her because of internalized prejudices to see white women as victims and innocent. 

Oh and the final thing. She‚Äôs a SA survivor. So if she speaks up on this that adds an air to authenticity to this voice memo being true. Because if a SA survivor finds these things credible that must mean it‚Äôs true, right? If you doubt a SA survivor than you are silencing victims, right?

Again. He knew what he was doing. And if Blaire was being really authentic about what she heard? Jeffree played her like a fiddle."

4773,2020-06-29 21:00:50,hh8xbg,I think part of it could be that if he shows it to people who aren‚Äôt trustworthy in the public‚Äôs eyes no one will believe them if they speak out. That‚Äôs the only reason I can think he‚Äôd be down to share it with Blair as opposed to other creators
4774,2020-06-29 21:08:40,hh8xbg,So when that was recorded; Jeffrey and Banks were in a studio in LA; Colossal in the UK and Keem in NY... Jeffrey offered to play it to banks in another room (he wasn‚Äôt interested; but keem wanted to hear it). My guess is- Jeffrey has ‚Äúmore control‚Äù over the ‚Äúpower‚Äù of it if only he has it; hence not sending it. Aka- he‚Äôs waiting to release it. That‚Äôs my theory anyways. Otherwise he would have already sent keem (that and it‚Äôs directly linked back to him leaking it- but in fairness if it‚Äôs ever leaked (I hope not) WE KNOW who it comes from)
4775,2020-06-29 21:03:37,hh8xbg,Idk I wouldn‚Äôt put it past keem to lie about not hearing it just so he doesn‚Äôt get dragged. He‚Äôs a trash person but I think even he knows not to get involved in this mess.

4777,2020-06-29 21:00:48,hh8xbg,"But when he did the podcast with Keem and FaZe, did he actually show the memo to them? I thought he showed it to both of them?"

4818,2020-06-28 06:28:15,hh8xbg,T-e-a
4819,2020-06-28 06:18:37,hh8xbg,Anthphrodite‚Äôs tarot pull from last year predicted that both Nate and Jeffree and Shane and Ryland would be tested this year. That‚Äôs my only guiding light for 2020 at this point lol.
4820,2020-06-28 06:43:14,hh8xbg,"I really don't see it. All of this affect them both, bet it will be really hard being around Shane for the next couple of years"
4821,2020-06-28 08:58:01,hh8xbg,I tried thinking about it but I really can't have an opinion on Ryland he seemed sweet in like 2018 but lately I don't understand him. I'm really curious about what's going to happen to their relationship
4822,2020-06-29 00:21:50,hh8xbg,"I stan Peter Monn. He seems to be the only one holding everybody equally accountable. The fact is, the worst people have the highest platform in the community!!! I love how he said ‚ÄúI can see why they all say they were all in a dark place, they LIVE in a dark place‚Äù very true!"
4823,2020-06-29 00:32:18,hh8xbg,"Do you not remember what happened to them when they hinted that their lives were better without him in it? 
It‚Äôs very very very clear why people don‚Äôt speak out against Jeff. His stans are a bunch of rabid dogs."
4824,2020-06-29 00:35:36,hh8xbg,"That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm kind of pissed at a lot of people. I‚Äôm starting to think that Jeffree‚Äôs hold over people is a bit exaggerated. Liam is fine and I think Blaire will be fine too. They would not lose everything by simply denouncing him, say. 

I‚Äôm trying to be understanding, but... idk. Everyone was fawning over Shae‚Äôs apology, but the biggest thing I heard was ‚ÄúI have known fucked up shit about Jeffree but I choose to keep my mouth shut and now I‚Äôm posturing‚Äù. She‚Äôs complicit, they‚Äôre all complicit. Will we hold them accountable for their part? 

How can we get mad and say that the beauty community isn‚Äôt toxic when a large part of it is complicit in this kind of stuff"
4825,2020-06-29 00:42:09,hh8xbg,Peter and Paige are my favorite drama channels. They‚Äôve both changed their minds and their content over time and I like to see that
4826,2020-06-29 03:37:41,hh8xbg,"Because they all engaged in the foul conversations. He is the big money man and they all wanted part of it, go along to get along."

4840,2020-06-29 22:09:26,hh8xbg,"Holy crap when you phrase it like that its real fucked up. I mean, I knew it was fucked up, but using a scale like that helps to really highlight it."

4842,2020-06-29 22:10:17,hh8xbg,"Well I‚Äôm sure there would be a lot of overlap of the same people watching all those videos, but it is still a HUGE part of the population!!!"
4843,2020-06-29 23:54:19,hh8xbg,"I usually find her a bit preachy but this was an excellent video, to the point."
4844,2020-06-29 23:59:23,hh8xbg,She did SO well with this.
4845,2020-06-30 00:24:02,hh8xbg,"Hey /u/sleepycaterpillar do you think we could get her video added to the list? I think she makes a ton of really good points and would be a worthwhile watch for anyone looking for a summary-ish type video. Not really any new information so I totally get if it isn't worth adding but there's not much else happening in general rn other than people unfollowing type stuff and the wild rumors so why not lol, also the proceeds go to RAINN so that's cool"
4846,2020-06-29 23:43:40,hh8xbg,Love her. She‚Äôs always well-spoken.
4847,2020-06-29 23:45:12,hh8xbg,nothing but respect for MY president

4850,2020-06-28 05:54:42,hh8xbg,"I'm convinced the people saying this were watching these videos when they were too young to know what was acceptable or not at the time. A <10-13 year-old watching Shane's old content would just assume that this older, funny, popular guy on the internet was acting in line with society's standards without another respected voice stepping in & telling them otherwise, and that age bracket was definitely his demographic back in the day.  
Edit: I forgot how the greater than & less than signs work lmao"
4851,2020-06-28 05:57:38,hh8xbg,"Exactly. I never liked Shane back when I was a 13 year old on YouTube because his jokes were just gross. I don't know how he made it this far (well, of course I do... but still)."

4853,2020-06-28 17:40:50,hh8xbg,Yes! This video helps J* more than it hurts him. Everyone knew ppl are afraid of him. But now we know he wasn‚Äôt lying about those receipts last year.
4854,2020-06-28 17:39:00,hh8xbg,"Yeah, that waiter was hanging out with James months after his accusation video. So I‚Äôm taking what Blair says with a grain of salt. I feel like J* paid her to make it less about him"

4856,2020-06-28 17:40:24,hh8xbg,This. If jafar thinks this is ‚Äútea‚Äù this is absolutely disgusting. I can‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs gonna walk away unscathed yet again.
4857,2020-06-28 17:42:09,hh8xbg,Yes! The #1 thing is to respect and protect the victims here.
4858,2020-06-28 17:41:46,hh8xbg,"I agree. I also find it uncomfortable to see everyone pushing for the potential victim to come forward. If there is a potential victim, they may not want to publicly come out. If there was an actual assault with a victim, I want the victim to handle this how they see fit. Whether or not they want to speak publicly or go to the police is completely up to them."

4860,2020-06-28 12:34:02,hh8xbg,"it‚Äôs scary how common sexual jokes about minors were, in the early stages of a lot of social media careers. jeffree tweeting at justin(16) over his d*ck size, gabbies insanely weird out of context tweet ‚Äúsmall children love my boobs‚Äù, literally shane‚Äôs entire channel, tanas instagram photo with that dude and a toddler they were ‚Äútaking home for the evening‚Äù (????) 

like i get some of these were out of context or just meant to be humorous but wtf? why was this SO common? and not at all funny? 

like gabbie had to provide context and said she was taking care of her younger siblings but still... why? it wasn‚Äôt funny, and just sounded creepy with 0 information."
4861,2020-06-28 12:45:11,hh8xbg,"it was the 2010s not the 1950s. people knew damn well racism and pedophilia were wrong, they just didn‚Äôt care because they weren‚Äôt held accountable. there are still niche pockets on the net where racism is ‚Äòok‚Äô and ‚Äòfunny‚Äô.  it‚Äôs such a stupid excuse because people were already calling him out back when he first started."
4862,2020-06-28 14:09:27,hh8xbg,"It is disturbing how often he joked about it, but I think at least in part it was so frequent because it was a maladaptive coping mechanism. Like if you make jokes about something awful that happened to you, you take its power away and you can pretend it wasn't something horrible. 

But not only does that not help longterm it's also massively harmful to those who are exposed to it, which is a totally unfair thing to put on others even if it is a coping mechanism"

4866,2020-06-28 14:24:17,hh8xbg,"He always goes to bat for the old timey youtubers, always. He's a POS.

Most likely, he'll fence sit but finish with something along the lines of ""people can change, I was awful once and I'm embarrassed by my old vids too!/1! I believe in grOWtH."""
4867,2020-06-28 13:41:42,hh8xbg,He has been on YouTube about the same amount of time as Shane. I don‚Äôt recall them ever having been in the same circles but I‚Äôd imagine they‚Äôve had friendly interaction over the years. I‚Äôm curious on the coverage as well.
4868,2020-06-28 13:48:01,hh8xbg,"i think he‚Äôs still recovering from his wife being stupid on twitter.

edit:
 
omg sorry it was more of a joke but i was referring to when she randomly tweeted at tana and praised her for being one of the only americans to denounce trump and fight racism on the daily (??!!). she sent it maybe 2 weeks ago and then kahlen retweeted it and added something else and then more old tweets from tanas timeline came in and revealed her calling imari a cotton picker/saying the n word more (years old tweets from like 2014-15)

idk what his wife responded with but he @d phil himself lol (this part was deleted from twitter)

4874,2020-06-28 20:33:17,hh8xbg,This. Everyone knew so much. No one is innocent. The whole community is toxic
4875,2020-06-28 22:13:53,hh8xbg, Have been thinking that as well. It's so gross how many people are present in the videos of shame doing these things and they all just laughed along.
4876,2020-06-28 22:59:14,hh8xbg,They did a good job contrasting Shane‚Äôs and Jenna‚Äôs statements.

4894,2020-06-29 11:57:08,hh8xbg,"Tati sounds very similar to the Hindi word *tatti* which means poop...so yeah, that's what I get reminded of when I hear Tati."

4902,2020-06-29 18:57:58,hh8xbg,He‚Äôll say something eventually. His ego won‚Äôt let him shut up and go away.
4903,2020-06-30 00:59:50,hh8xbg,Jeffree will. I doubt Shane will since he posts so infrequently. Maybe in 6 months or a year. Or he'll start showing up in Ryland's videos in a couple months to test the water.
4904,2020-06-30 00:47:32,hh8xbg,I 100% see him coming back with a documentary series of how he was cancelled üôÑ

4911,2020-06-29 15:21:32,hh8xbg,This made me look at their page. One of his partners is Kevin Hart. We need to notify him he needs to move his merch asap!
4912,2020-06-28 20:20:02,hh8xbg,How can they even make these sorts of accusations without proof? JC should sue.
4913,2020-06-28 20:38:32,hh8xbg,"Oh I completely agree.

Let‚Äôs not forget- that Jeffrey chose to bring this back up- around or right before the time of James‚Äô big show- Instant Influencer AS WELL AS when Jeffrey was being questioned regarding his association with Dahvie Vanity (and that awe full interview with Chris Hansen- full of lies and hypocrisy from Jeffrey). 

It‚Äôs a way for him to bring him JC down, and bring the spotlight off of him. 

Also from memory- FaZe Banks didn‚Äôt want to be involved in hearing it."
4914,2020-06-28 20:31:46,hh8xbg,"I think some drama channels are, Sebastian Williams is pointing out how he's using a victim's voice memo showing it to everyone as ""tea"""
4915,2020-06-28 20:21:02,hh8xbg,Yes yes yes this needs to be shared.
4916,2020-06-28 20:56:37,hh8xbg,This needs to be at the top. It's upsetting how quickly the narrative has changed.
4917,2020-06-28 20:28:20,hh8xbg,"If this is true , which im starting to think it is, then Blaire framing the video primarily as an attack on Jefree is clever because it immedietly deflects any insinuation that Blaire is trying to help Jefree while simultaneously Propagating his narrative that James is a predator, something hes been trying to claim for a year now."
4918,2020-06-28 20:17:42,hh8xbg,"The only reason I‚Äôm in favor of her posting this is because now this brings Jeffree back in. A lot of people are only coming at Shane, I want J* to answer for his bullshit once and for all. If this forces his grubby hands to issue a statement, good."
4919,2020-06-28 20:35:35,hh8xbg,"But.. at the end of her video and in a pinned comment Blaire says she will make a video on Shane‚Äôs predator behaviour, and that she can‚Äôt be close to toxic people. I really don‚Äôt think she is on his side."
4920,2020-06-28 22:12:21,hh8xbg,"Oooh, so you think that Jeffree is using the ‚Äúvoicemail‚Äù to somehow get the heat off of Shane? And this is him standing up for him...?"
4921,2020-06-28 15:05:53,hh8xbg,"I agree, white followers also need to make a decision what to do going forward in terms of supporting Shane and people he associates with. While not specifically accepting or denying that part of the apology, there is a decision to be made for everyone."
4922,2020-06-28 16:21:49,hh8xbg,"those white people are the ones that say ""it's not my place bc I'm not black but it was years ago and he has grown/ has mental issues"" and try to justify his behaviour ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢"
4923,2020-06-28 16:50:19,hh8xbg,He‚Äôs also done a lot more than anti-black racism (but oh BOY has he done a lot of anti-black racism)
4924,2020-06-28 14:56:44,hh8xbg,Amen
4925,2020-06-28 06:23:30,hh8xbg,His name is allegedly in some book.
4926,2020-06-28 06:19:05,hh8xbg,"Anonymous leaked a ""little black book"" of Epstein's contacts. Will Smith was one of the famous people on that list. Some of them are probably involved in the pedophile stuff, but some are just rich and famous. But yeah there's a lot of people on that list ü§î"
4927,2020-06-28 06:17:45,hh8xbg,"That's old. Will Smith is in Epstein's contact book, but I don't think there's any evidence he went to the island. It's hard to tell what if anything he knew about Epstein."

4930,2020-06-28 07:58:53,hh8xbg,I unfollowed him everywhere so I keep coming back here to check if there‚Äôs any news ü§°
4931,2020-06-28 12:04:27,hh8xbg,I only see shane. Jeffree needs to be catching as much heat as Shane is right now.
4932,2020-06-28 12:57:09,hh8xbg,I‚Äôm pretty sure he already is. I‚Äôd assume he‚Äôs pushing the drama channels on his payroll like Rich Lux to bring more attention to Shane.
4933,2020-06-28 13:15:57,hh8xbg,"I think he already has been like other people have mentioned. But to his face and publicly: no, it would look bad. He‚Äôs probably convincing Shane that this backlash is bringing them closer together. Bonding thru cancellation. That way he can manipulate him even further and make sure he stays on his side while he pays drama channels to talk about Shane even more to get the heat off of his back. 

Jeffree acts like a total narcissist and that‚Äôs what a narcissist would do. I unfortunately have had a lot of experience with them"
4934,2020-06-28 12:55:58,hh8xbg,"I most definitely believe that he is the one some part of Shane's downfall. Either leaking videos or paying drama channels, Idk... but he is not sitting there quietly doing nothing FOR SURE"
4935,2020-06-28 12:51:05,hh8xbg,Honestly I doubt it since they've probably signed a contract with the whole conspiracy line. I'm sure he'll post some shady tweets alleging to it though in hopes of getting out unharmed. Shane will soon realize that Jeremiah was never his friend. His silence speaks volumes
4936,2020-06-28 12:50:58,hh8xbg,"I feel like if Juxtaposition Strudel tries that, it‚Äôll just end up backfiring on him, but wouldn‚Äôt be surprised"
4937,2020-06-28 12:50:08,hh8xbg,I've been wondering this too!
4938,2020-06-28 14:45:32,hh8xbg,"I think that's kinda why he made the Shane channel, it's only been around for like 5 years."
4939,2020-06-28 14:40:39,hh8xbg,"Yeah probably wants to remove himself and others from his old content, especially his young fans who don‚Äôt know about his old content."
4940,2020-06-28 15:03:30,hh8xbg,I worry about what happened when there were no cameras.
4941,2020-06-28 15:20:18,hh8xbg,holy shit you just transported me back to early 2010s 3dgy YouTube
4942,2020-06-28 15:32:23,hh8xbg,He‚Äôs already made two videos about this lol
4943,2020-06-28 15:13:24,hh8xbg,He‚Äôs too busy posting to onlyfans
4944,2020-06-28 15:14:09,hh8xbg,He already did
4945,2020-06-28 15:15:01,hh8xbg,I heard he already came out with a video a few days ago
4946,2020-06-28 15:19:54,hh8xbg,"Thank you guys, it's time to update my tea, then :)"
4947,2020-06-28 16:02:35,hh8xbg,Who's onion boy?
4948,2020-06-28 16:38:03,hh8xbg,He waits.
4949,2020-06-28 16:42:23,hh8xbg,I think we‚Äôll hear later.... ‚ò†Ô∏è
4950,2020-06-28 17:01:43,hh8xbg,the question is... will that happen as a part of D3.1 or D4?? the s u s p e n s e
4951,2020-06-28 16:58:24,hh8xbg,"Ikr, instead we get blaire witch exposing him"
4952,2020-06-28 17:11:39,hh8xbg,Yes yes! I was thinking a tiger king doc. But I hope to someday see coverage of all this a few years letter.
4953,2020-06-28 18:36:49,hh8xbg,This feels like it was a decade ago..
4954,2020-06-28 19:23:37,hh8xbg,Jeez we're going mainstream now
4955,2020-06-28 19:30:53,hh8xbg,The Smiths have spoken. This is gonna get nasty for Shane.
4956,2020-06-28 19:24:04,hh8xbg,Damn.
4957,2020-06-28 20:18:50,hh8xbg,"He fucking better. I mean- as of last count; about 100 survivors of Dahvie have spoken out either publicaly; or privately to other survivors, and either as themselves or anonomously. The FBI is involved, and shit is gonna hit the fan for him. 

And I‚Äôm curious as to who he‚Äôll dob on to pull down with him..."
4958,2020-06-28 20:11:21,hh8xbg,Just put Britney‚Äôs circus on repeat. That‚Äôs what we got. ü§°

4962,2020-06-29 01:01:36,hh8xbg,I wouldnt want her following me either
4963,2020-06-29 01:08:12,hh8xbg,"Looks like she unfollowed on the 21st, interesting"
4964,2020-06-29 23:57:15,hh8xbg,"Sorry I‚Äôm high, what‚Äôs NYT?"
4965,2020-06-29 22:17:54,hh8xbg,I think it was the Dahvie Vanity situation. It wasn‚Äôt a shocking explosion of drama but more and more things continued to be exposed that turned more eyes on SD and J*. I think that‚Äôs why this Dramageddon is reaching MSM.
4966,2020-06-29 22:15:28,hh8xbg,Probably when jeffree went on moms basement maybe?
4967,2020-06-29 23:07:57,hh8xbg,Honestly I think it was with the dahvie vanity situation blwoing up
4968,2020-06-29 22:17:39,hh8xbg,When tab released his video?
4969,2020-06-29 23:06:40,hh8xbg,If I were manny and Laura I would be so pissed right now! They had their asses handed to them because they dared speak out against king J ..... and now everyone is coming out of the woodwork saying J* is the worst. Where were these people when they were losing everything?
4970,2020-06-29 23:22:53,hh8xbg,"For me, this began when Kameron Lester made the video about not supporting Jeffree and why.  I can‚Äôt remember the other person who was closed friends with Jeffree.  He also made a video explaining why he didn‚Äôt want to be associated with Jeffree.  Kameron sort of alluded that Dramagedon 2 was planned by Jeffree."
4971,2020-06-30 00:19:07,hh8xbg,Bobby is on onlyfans now

4974,2020-06-30 00:20:48,hh8xbg,"That's it other than the typical rounds of other drama channels. I think maybe smokey glows video should be added, you should check that out for sure"
4975,2020-06-30 01:43:06,hh8xbg,"Target dropped Shane's books officially, but they had probably already stopped stocking them in store."
4976,2020-06-30 01:41:59,hh8xbg,"honestly it's not worth the watch,  she gave no new info and just distracted ppl and brought focus back on the damn voice memo which is a) not verified as credible and at this point seems like a horrible game of telephone and b) is really awful that ppl keep bringing up a potential victim who wants no pay of this."
4977,2020-06-28 12:54:14,hh8xbg,"Most people that claim that, weren't even alive back then. It was never ok to act like a pedo or be blatantly racist. It was way more common to use homophobic slurs or transphobic etc, and yeah edgier jokes were more common but not to that extent, no never"
4978,2020-06-28 14:18:53,hh8xbg,"I think it‚Äôs easy to say it was a ‚Äòdifferent time‚Äô if you weren‚Äôt someone that was really engaged it what was trendy at the time, so like you said, teens that have only seen his conspiracy stuff and were too young back then. I say the same shit about my parents generation but I honestly have no clue what it was like. 

But ten years ago I was a teen and that shit was not acceptable. It wasn‚Äôt acceptable than, the only reason people though it was, was because of websites likes 4chan that were gross but also niche that talked about shit for shock value like Shane uses as an excuse. If it was common it wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äòshocking‚Äô. I think the difference was that youtube wasn‚Äôt as big, like it was big but it didn‚Äôt have cult followers and fans like it does today. But right and wrong hasn‚Äôt changed in ten years, people are just more vocal and informed in 2020."
4979,2020-06-28 14:10:08,hh8xbg,"Something ‚Äúfrom that time‚Äù is Friends. Maybe ‚Äútoo early‚Äù but still highly influential. Highly problematic now, but not then. No blackface, no rape jokes, no pedophile jokes. Plenty of transphobic jokes, and homophobic/toxic masculinity jokes (but they still overcame a bit of it and showed men that ITS OKAY TO HUG AND LOVE YOUR BEST FRIEND). 

The closest they came to blackface was when Ross fucked up his tanning, and that wasn‚Äôt even CLOSE to Shane‚Äôs many racist caricatures. 

Btw, anyone else notice that most of Shane‚Äôs black- and brownface ‚Äúcharacters‚Äù were women? I‚Äôve only seen one male ‚Äúblack‚Äù ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù from all the vids that has been posted. The rest have been women. 
Is it just me or is Shane ridiculously misogynistic?"
4980,2020-06-28 12:57:43,hh8xbg,"It was a time when the youth were getting their rocks off on saying racist and ped@phelic sh!t with no repercussions. Point being, they were and still are the type of people who gloat and get off on their POWER to do that and get away with it."
4981,2020-06-28 23:25:05,hh8xbg,I don‚Äôt think we should defend her team for abusing copyright laws. They also removed a miranda sings cover which was extremely pg

4983,2020-06-30 04:09:42,hh8xbg,i‚Äôve been thinking about this. i‚Äôm sober myself and i‚Äôm proud of it ‚Äî would it really be that hard to say ‚Äòi don‚Äôt drink anymore?‚Äô like who cares if jababa stupida drinks?
4984,2020-06-30 04:12:38,hh8xbg,This has ALWAYS bothered me! I distinctly remember him drinking at a show I went to in 2011. It‚Äôs such a trivial thing to lie about & it makes you wonder if everything that comes out of his mouth just consists of lies too. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
4985,2020-06-30 04:13:53,hh8xbg,"He‚Äôs been lying about that forever and I have no clue why.

Back in the MySpace days he used to get drunk and go on Stickam and act a fool.

He also tweeted a ton about drinking. He was always drinking cotton candy vodka and soda or something similar"
4986,2020-06-30 04:15:54,hh8xbg,"junglegym sweat lies about literally the most minuscule, nonsensical things. it makes you wonder what else he‚Äôs lying about."

4990,2020-06-28 19:00:53,hh8xbg,Cackling. Those are my new favorite names for them.
4991,2020-06-28 19:06:46,hh8xbg,"Omg those names üò≠

Reminds me of a creative yet ugly metaphor I came up with about those two"
4992,2020-06-28 19:12:13,hh8xbg,"Blaire White is as bad as Shane and Jafar, if not worse. She‚Äôs a white supremacist alt right troll"
4993,2020-06-29 14:17:44,hh8xbg,"Yeah, it's really a shame. The first 'viral' video Liam made about J* past was really insightful and when he spoke about the theory he had it was really articulate. Now on twitter it's kind of annoying to see him essentially push for more drama."
4994,2020-06-29 14:27:41,hh8xbg,"Yes, so true! I really like his commentary videos and I think its very objective/rational. Not biased, no tea or drama, but caring for the real issues. Now why is he keep pushing for the dramas?? I kinda disappointed honestly..."
4995,2020-06-29 14:15:49,hh8xbg,I remember I think it was bea lucile said that there‚Äôs a group of people trying to take down j* and one of them is ruining the group project because the person is after the fame and glory. I think we can safely say that the person is Liam.
4996,2020-06-28 12:21:45,hh8xbg,"Yeah she is only using that info to bail out her racist and creepy friend. So not a good look. If Shane would not be in the pickle he is in now, she would not have bothered."
4997,2020-06-28 12:26:15,hh8xbg,THIS !!! She‚Äôs such a hypocrite.
4998,2020-06-28 12:31:43,hh8xbg,Blaire is a gross and weird person. I mean I don't know why anyone would support her in this when she's nearly as problematic as Shane.
4999,2020-06-28 12:32:20,hh8xbg,"In Shane's defence, there are no allegations of sexual assault or grooming here. Unlike Jafar.

It is fully possible for both Blaire to be a douchebag and for her to expose J* for his own horrors."
5000,2020-06-28 15:18:36,hh8xbg,"Normally I would say he has a chance because there‚Äôs always a market for racist white people but idk because the pedophilia stuff is a whole other story.

Even Milo Yiannopolous got deplatformed for pedophiliac comments"
5001,2020-06-28 15:10:02,hh8xbg,I thought the same until the Smith Family called him out. He is done.

5005,2020-06-28 15:02:10,hh8xbg,"Yeah. If it had just stayed as they orchestrated dramageddon 2 I could‚Äôve seen him bouncing back from that, but now? It‚Äôs soooooo far gone."

5009,2020-06-28 19:32:48,hh8xbg,I think the Vlog Squad stuff is on a different plane to what is happening rn with everything. It started bc Trisha wanted to push the blame away from her friends J\* and Shane and her first attempt didn't work ( she tried to bring up the old drama with Gabbie out of the blue)
5010,2020-06-28 20:10:13,hh8xbg,yep he did say that on the moms  basement podcast
5011,2020-06-28 20:23:00,hh8xbg,"Isn‚Äôt this the voice memo that Ashlye and Sanders have been alluding to as well? I‚Äôm not trusting in the existence of anything I haven‚Äôt heard myself, so I don‚Äôt care much either way right now, but BW isn‚Äôt the first to have brought it up.Ôøº

... though part of me wonders if she really has heard it herself, or if she‚Äôs just building off of what others have said to take heat off SD, lol."
5012,2020-06-28 20:22:23,hh8xbg,She‚Äôs already a much-despised attention seeker. This brings her more of the attention she craves. What would she lose?
5013,2020-06-28 20:15:43,hh8xbg,She also has nothing to lose by lying. She's getting a ton of attention. And it got some pressure off her long time friend.
5014,2020-06-28 20:16:45,hh8xbg,"She's leveraging White Women's Tears to both make her base (cishet conservative dudes who hate LGBTQ+ folks and rely on her as My Trans Friend to parrot their argument) back her harder, and she's deflected attention away from Jeffree and Shane back to James Charles.

She has nothing to lose and everything to gain by expanding her reach like this."
5015,2020-06-28 20:22:08,hh8xbg,she did say she contacted the alleged survivor to confirm its true
5016,2020-06-28 20:25:29,hh8xbg,He sucks. He is just trying to stay out of drama. Over him
5017,2020-06-28 20:27:43,hh8xbg,"Keemstar wasn't there with J* from what I understand, Banks was. I went to listen to the podcast and J* offered to let Banks listen to the memo, and then they went off talking about Tati instead so I don't think anyone listened to it. 

It would have been interesting if either of them had pursued it. For what it's worth I get the vibe that J* offered and then immediately wanted to deflect to Tati instead."
5018,2020-06-28 20:41:28,hh8xbg,"What exactly did keemstar say no to in the tweet? As in ""no i didn't hear it"" or ""no it's not credible"""
5019,2020-06-28 20:26:12,hh8xbg,Ok but tbh keemstar is a horrible horrible person who will say and do anything if it‚Äôs better for him. Idk now saying that would be better for him in this situation but personally I don‚Äôt trust anything he says after seeing H3H3‚Äôs content nuke a few weeks ago on top of several other people‚Äôs accounts of him
5020,2020-06-28 20:23:50,hh8xbg,Or its not credible
5021,2020-06-28 21:02:50,hh8xbg,Keem really isn‚Äôt the best judge of what makes a ‚Äúcredible sexual assault allegation‚Äù judging by the misogyny taking place on his Twitter rn

5023,2020-06-29 01:32:28,hh8xbg,Maybe she was willing to lie to get the heat off her racist bestie Shane
5024,2020-06-29 03:33:57,hh8xbg,"I'm an outsider looking in in regards to Shane as I never watched his docu-series or his skits but I've seen clips of him throughout the years. I never knew what it was that I couldn't put my finger on but felt strange about his personality, similar to the feeling I get when I watch Ellen. That never genuine smile or laugh reaching the eyes. Seeing the docu-series of The Chair really hit the nail on the head. It seems like Shane has the same personality he did then but he's been trying to suppress it. Not change it or fix it, but genuinely suppress it. You could see he always wanted to say more than he did and that series really shows his inner workings."
5025,2020-06-29 03:11:12,hh8xbg,"I second this - it‚Äôs really worth a watch. Does such a great job of showing Shane‚Äôs true colours - his racism, his immaturity, his victim complex, his stubbornness, his total inability to take criticism."
5026,2020-06-29 02:52:25,hh8xbg,There are also clips of him in that show floating around on Twitter and YouTube
5027,2020-06-29 08:09:42,hh8xbg,[deleted]
5028,2020-06-29 15:37:36,hh8xbg,I'd honestly laugh out loud if she teases a new video coming soon on her channel. Then when the video finally comes out.. it's her promoting a new Halo Beauty product.
5029,2020-06-29 14:53:11,hh8xbg,I‚Äôm going to need it from all this anxiety
5030,2020-06-29 14:46:33,hh8xbg,Yes and I hope it‚Äôs in gummy form.
5031,2020-06-29 20:07:35,hh8xbg,I feel the same way. I‚Äôm just realizing what a terrible influence he was... I feel really gross and upset. He should‚Äôve never been allowed on YT.
5032,2020-06-29 19:59:48,hh8xbg,"I completely agree with feeling weird. I've been wrestling with it a lot but have come to the conclusion that I was sheltered and uneducated. I also thought as a kid ""oh well he's making fun of everyone, not just one group, so it's not really that bad.."" and now that I'm older, I'm so horrified that I ever thought that way."
5033,2020-06-29 20:08:09,hh8xbg,"Yeah he fucking boiled us like frogs, we didn't know any better"
5034,2020-06-29 20:00:12,hh8xbg,"I feel sick for anyone who watched him when they were younger. It‚Äôs grooming, like those newer fked up cartoons that were all over YouTube"
5035,2020-06-29 20:21:56,hh8xbg,"I googled it the other day and I was around 10/11 when Shane first started doing his Shanaynay thing. My parents always had stricter restrictions on the internet, and I was more or less not allowed to watch YouTube at all, so the only Shane videos I would watch were ones my friends would show me at their house. I don‚Äôt remember watching too many videos of his, but I know for sure I had seen some of his racist videos (like the Shanaynay ones), and I was too young/uninformed to really understand them. I feel gross thinking about them now, but I was honestly such a child to have really understood what I was watching. Like 10 years old, I‚Äôm in 5th grade (elementary school) and I‚Äôm just starting to learn real swear words because I grew up pretty sheltered. Overall I‚Äôm happy my parents really limited my YouTube because I wasn‚Äôt exposed to his content that often, but we can‚Äôt help but wish we knew better"
5036,2020-06-29 21:20:29,hh8xbg,"Same here. I actually learned about sex stuff from his videos...ewww. I never really registered exactly how racist he was up until I watched some of his old clips on twitter recently. It‚Äôs shocking to me how I could see that stuff and not realize how gross it was. I get I was pretty young, but still..."
5037,2020-06-29 20:21:21,hh8xbg,"what i enjoy about that is that if you read the whole page it shows that no he wasn't just so uwu innocent and unaware of his racism because everyone was okay with it back then like all his stans are trying to say, since the ""comments have been flooding my YouTube since the beginning""."
5038,2020-06-29 20:44:13,hh8xbg,"That quote doesnt even make sense? Like im assuming the margaret cho he referenced is asian, so if her humor is about fellow asians that doesnt mean that shane whos white can then make racist jokes about any race? Like... am i missing the point or is that quote just really fked up?"

5047,2020-06-29 23:12:17,hh8xbg,"Gee, I wonder if they're part of the 1,000,000+ people who watched Blaire's video. Sure was nice of her to expose this shit to an even wider audience and narrow down the potential victim pool, too."
5048,2020-06-29 22:57:06,hh8xbg,Yikes...
5049,2020-06-29 23:20:06,hh8xbg,"Wow, shocking. It's like literally nobody's learned from this exact same accusation last year."
5050,2020-06-30 03:14:53,hh8xbg,"I am so mama bear angry at the fact that ppl are still even talking about this voice memo.  wtf do they not get,  it's either fake or exploitative as FUCK and the only ppl who benefit from it being talked about is jingleheimer and anyone using it for views.  There is not one single valid reason why we should give it anymore attention or platform! it is either HURTING A VICTIM or HELPING A PIECE OF SHIT.  end of. If it comes out that it was true, speculating about it now does NOTHING.  If you are so concerned about a victim, shut up about the memo, and believe victims when THEY choose to speak up.

5064,2020-06-28 22:31:20,hh8xbg,Yes. I will be so disappointed if they all stay silent. I am very proud of miss fame for speaking up.
5065,2020-06-28 22:58:20,hh8xbg,aquaria too but i expect the least from her
5066,2020-06-28 09:05:09,hh8xbg,Same. I've barely got halfway through my first coffee and already I'm drowning in tea.

5069,2020-06-28 05:57:04,hh8xbg,Theres a non zero chance J* at least keeps tabs on this sub so he knows how things stand and what the public thinks. Whether he‚Äôd leak anything is beyond me

5073,2020-06-28 07:07:08,hh8xbg,Wouldn't ve surprised. It wouldn't be the first time he tried to secretly influence public opinion. Shocked he didnt pay any drama channels to do it so far

5075,2020-06-28 23:38:18,hh8xbg,Yeah I could really go for a bad cover song and some butterflies rn
5076,2020-06-29 00:17:36,hh8xbg,this whole year seems like 10 years ago lmao

5078,2020-06-29 15:32:02,hh8xbg,"I saw that video a few times last year during the tati/jc drama, but everyone just kinda stopped talking about it after his video so idk why more people don‚Äôt know about it"

Edit: this was in liams video but no one has since spoken about it"
5080,2020-06-29 18:36:47,hh8xbg,"He posted another one that has a [screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/TNNGL3U) and says ""Last tweet before I go and finish today's video (which talks about this):   


 Y'all notice that Jeffree Star's robbery story is EXACTLY the same as this actually real makeup warehouse robbery story that happened a year prior? But somehow there are no police statement's about Jeff's?""  


Um WOW"
5081,2020-06-29 18:40:33,hh8xbg,"I hope with these kind of videos that are imo not as serious/cancellation justified as others, Jeffree can‚Äôt easily debunk them. Because if he can it just looks like a witch hunt and that will only help him"

5083,2020-06-29 20:01:53,hh8xbg,"Woah. Didn't he claim it was an inside job? That's not good to make his employees feel untrustworthy.

Although, he was robbed before the Blue Blood robbery. There were unreleased concealers that popped up on Facebook. Maybe he just repeated the story to add ~drama to the docuseries."
5084,2020-06-28 06:17:58,hh8xbg,"With the Smith family getting involved, I‚Äôm willing to bet mainstream media will pick the story up. They‚Äôre an extremely well known family, and Will Smith has also crossed platforms and is considered a YouTuber as well. I think Shane is about to get hit with legal repercussions as well as the general public having negative feelings towards him, not just the YouTube audience."

5092,2020-06-28 15:17:10,hh8xbg,I can't help thinking the animal weirdness was being used as a smokescreen for the inappropriate stuff with kids. Wouldn't be the first time a kiddie fiddler in the public eye created a highly eccentric image for that purpose.
5093,2020-06-28 15:45:04,hh8xbg,"I‚Äôm not sure if ‚ÄúShame‚Äù was mis-typed, but I really want to start calling him Shame Dawson now. 

I never watched Shame back in the day, but I did watch Phil‚Äôs show (when he had that horrible theme song) so I still kinda watch him, I also would LOVE to hear how he handles this. It‚Äôs blown up so much, he can‚Äôt not talk about it."
5094,2020-06-28 17:16:48,hh8xbg,I expect him to be disgusted because he's got kids. I will probably be disappointed. Its depressing.
5095,2020-06-28 17:28:26,hh8xbg,"Wtf. If a voice memo really exists and does in fact prove that JC assaulted someone, how disgusting of Jafar to just show it anyone who asks, but not the actual police."
5096,2020-06-28 17:37:43,hh8xbg,Blaire White is so fuckin full of shit. She leaves all the ‚Äúreaching for camera‚Äù shots in to make it seem hurried and frantic but she has time to edit in her Instagram and Twitter handles and the dramatic ‚Äú1 hour later‚Äù stinger. I don‚Äôt believe a single word of this video.
5097,2020-06-28 19:13:12,hh8xbg,I bet you this memo doesn‚Äôt even exist lmao
5098,2020-06-28 19:10:32,hh8xbg,honestly the part i find most wild about all of this is the idea that anyone would ever tell jeffree star anything
5099,2020-06-28 19:12:12,hh8xbg,Imagine getting a memo like that and your first instinct is to figure out how to use it to your advantage..
5100,2020-06-28 19:14:53,hh8xbg,absolutely. if this ‚Äúmemo‚Äù ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù‚Äùexists‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù how is it credible? we all know Jeff lies and lies and lies.
5101,2020-06-28 19:12:16,hh8xbg,"By claiming that he doesn't know if it is true or not, he is protecting himself legally from a defamation lawsuit. He is skirting the edge of what he can and can't say."

5103,2020-06-28 20:04:37,hh8xbg,Exactly and it's not hard to imitate voices (digitally). Not to mention none of the folks that supposedly heard this voice memo personally know the alleged victim.
5104,2020-06-28 20:35:27,hh8xbg,Jeffrey Epstar IM SCREAMING
5105,2020-06-28 20:27:38,hh8xbg,My thoughts exactly. How could she conveniently just leave out whether the victim also confirmed the voice memos validity. That would help clear up a lot.
5106,2020-06-28 20:31:50,hh8xbg,I was under the assumption that the voice memo was from the victim?
5107,2020-06-28 20:31:48,hh8xbg,"From the way she describes the memo, it comes across that it's supposed to be the victim talking. So if the memo exists and isn't fake, it wouldn't be hearsay, it'd be from the victim themselves."
5108,2020-06-28 21:09:25,hh8xbg,"You know it.  He knows how to play the game.  He has money, fame, and an expensive attorney on retainer."
5109,2020-06-28 22:50:17,hh8xbg,if i was tati I'd homer simpson into the bushes and take my money and run. Unless she has something insanely damning to release there is no smart move for her to make atm.

5113,2020-06-29 04:23:40,hh8xbg,I don‚Äôt think Aquaria‚Äôs post has anything to do with J*. One of Sharon‚Äôs other drag daughters came forward with their story of abuse and manipulation by Sharon.
5114,2020-06-29 04:12:46,hh8xbg,"I read the whole post, it's incredibly sad. I really feel for them and hope they're getting treatment, you can see there's serious lasting effects."
5115,2020-06-29 04:12:41,hh8xbg,Wait plz explain
5116,2020-06-29 07:02:16,hh8xbg,"Cause they all take the weekend off from their corporate jobs. Nordstrom‚Äôs is the only store I saw yank a brand off their site on a Sunday mere hours after they were informed of racist and discriminatory culture at that brand. Most retailers wouldn‚Äôt do that. Too much red tape, too many middle men, too much approval and discussion required in their corporate structure."
5117,2020-06-29 06:57:50,hh8xbg,"Business administrators don‚Äôt work on weekends so they probably haven‚Äôt come up with a decision yet since this is something that would require lengthy discussion. I‚Äôm thinking morphe might stop selling the conspiracy palette this week (hopefully, who knows)"

5123,2020-06-29 21:12:09,hh8xbg,"Omg watching these videos is making me really question wtf YouTube was doing letting him have a platform. It's universally offensive and it's not like this was uploaded to an obscure corner of the internet. I'm curious to know when these videos were taken down and how popular this channel was? I'm assuming it was millions of subs, right?"
5124,2020-06-29 20:26:31,hh8xbg,"I kinda want to watch but I‚Äôm kind of already sick to my stomach. Nah I‚Äôll pass, I‚Äôve got enough proof that Shane is a sick individual"
5125,2020-06-29 21:19:20,hh8xbg,Uh wow the whole video was nauseating
5126,2020-06-29 20:25:16,hh8xbg,oh my god. the 6:30 minute mark is incredibly disturbing as well
5127,2020-06-29 21:47:28,hh8xbg,thats straight up NOT funny wtf.... and people really forgave this garbage dude?
5128,2020-06-29 23:18:04,hh8xbg,"Did he just list down all the popular female celebs who were minors at that time? It's so deliberate and pathetic, especially for an adult man."
5129,2020-06-29 21:07:22,hh8xbg,"Yeah, it's kinda grossing me out that people on this sub are talking about this as ""drama"" and calling it ""fun"" or ""exciting""."
5130,2020-06-29 21:38:05,hh8xbg,I watched all his videos when I was 11 or 12 and didn‚Äôt know any of it was wrong. He knew his demographic too. It‚Äôs just so messed up.
5131,2020-06-29 22:56:20,hh8xbg,"During that show that was about the making of it he had problem hiring actors, actors dropping out and people not wanting their names used because of how gross the script is."
5132,2020-06-29 22:52:34,hh8xbg,Imagine how many young impressionable minds he polluted with the garbage he put on YT.

5139,2020-06-28 05:37:24,hh8xbg,Yeah. Weird that that COULDNT stay up- yet all of Shane‚Äôs actual videos did for years
5140,2020-06-28 07:05:43,hh8xbg,I was halfway through it when it went unavailable üò≠
5141,2020-06-28 08:35:45,hh8xbg,"Yep. I never bought into the hype, but probably because I also didn't vibe with his content. When I found out about his racism and his Sandy Hook Crisis Actor conspiracy videos I was shocked that people were talking about how ""nice"" he is. Like wtf. Then seeing he was still selling his racist character merch while being praised and excused was baffling."
5142,2020-06-28 08:56:36,hh8xbg,Poor Ryland probably couldn‚Äôt keep up moderating it and fell asleep

5145,2020-06-28 11:37:57,hh8xbg,"I remember that. The puppet was called ‚Äúmilly‚Äù she was supposed to be a 5/6 year old autistic girl, who is abused by her dad. Shane even made a youtube channel for the puppet called ‚Äúmillies world‚Äù, gonna go ss the channel in case he deletes it

Edit: found tye channel, called ‚ÄúHeyItsMilly‚Äù. There used to be content, but it seems to have all been privatized . I have screenshotted the channel,in case it is deleted ."
5146,2020-06-28 11:33:49,hh8xbg,This is repeated behaviour!

5148,2020-06-28 11:33:45,hh8xbg,The puppet Millie? I vaguely remember that and it being so weird and inappropriate. Can‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt laugh at it at the time though.

5150,2020-06-28 12:19:38,hh8xbg,Oh fuck
5151,2020-06-28 12:47:03,hh8xbg,"According to the comments, he never followed him on there to begin with. Weird."
5152,2020-06-28 12:36:33,hh8xbg,A good start. Now let‚Äôs see if he unfollows everywhere else...
5153,2020-06-28 15:24:27,hh8xbg,"I‚Äôm on set for a film I‚Äôm working on and I feel you, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll get to watch until I‚Äôm home later"

5155,2020-06-28 16:58:37,hh8xbg,"Honestly, part of me was wondering if her and Shane had a fall out too. Him and Jeffree are still good and even though she initially said she was going to make the video in his defense, He could‚Äôve asked her not to in order to try to let things die down. It could be Shane who she‚Äôs been saying is ‚Äútrying to silence‚Äù her"
5156,2020-06-28 17:15:57,hh8xbg,I genuinely get so confused when people don‚Äôt know about his past?? Like am I just *that* old that I remember watching his and jenna‚Äôs videos? As far as I know they were still up YouTube until he started recently deleting everything.
5157,2020-06-28 17:14:52,hh8xbg,[removed]

5159,2020-06-28 17:09:49,hh8xbg,Surprising considering how much she‚Äôs on about them
5160,2020-06-28 17:13:27,hh8xbg,I took it that it was another popular ytuber that r***ped someone else aside from james- and he didnt show proof of that however

5163,2020-06-28 19:16:12,hh8xbg,For sure. He intentionally seeks out cannon fodder and nothing will convince me otherwise.
5164,2020-06-28 19:40:11,hh8xbg,"I said this in the last megathread but in addition to what you, aligning himself with problematic ppl pretty much guarantees that \*insert problematic person here\*  stans would not have a problem with him. I mean do you remember when Tati tried to collab with him and her fans were like NOPE so she had to do the sidestep of keeping him off her channel without unfriending him?  But especially with Shame he knew those fans would accept him and defend his past."
5165,2020-06-29 00:35:18,hh8xbg,Wait what video
5166,2020-06-29 17:07:30,hh8xbg,SAME especially if it begin with J üòÇ

5169,2020-06-28 19:55:08,hh8xbg,Same here. Hairy lipsticks seems like child‚Äôs play compared to this stuff
5170,2020-06-28 19:37:02,hh8xbg,Can we go back to the time when the first Jaclyn Hill x Morphe pallette was the bees knees and tutorials were for practical looks üò≠
5171,2020-06-28 19:56:14,hh8xbg,Yeap. Stopped being ‚Äúfun‚Äù when all the pedo stuff + Blair White speaking out came out
5172,2020-06-28 19:35:19,hh8xbg,Same
5173,2020-06-28 19:38:48,hh8xbg,Uh what. Was it fun to look at the racist and pedophilic videos  Shane had made? I must be missing something
5174,2020-06-28 05:33:37,hh8xbg,Doesn‚Äôt Will have a connection to YouTube? It‚Äôs very possible Shane could be banned.
5175,2020-06-28 05:59:24,hh8xbg,"you realize it was comedy, right? Social commentary?"
5176,2020-06-28 08:11:33,hh8xbg,You cannot be fueling my conspiracy mind like this rn. I‚Äôm about to make a theory board with yarn.
5177,2020-06-28 08:23:43,hh8xbg,These are my thoughts EXACTLY.
5178,2020-06-28 08:11:26,hh8xbg,That was my thought. All his scandals are now being pushed to the side for a minute. And jeffree hasn't said two words about shane
5179,2020-06-28 08:25:16,hh8xbg,I wouldn‚Äôt put it past him. I hope he is next. I don‚Äôt want him to get off scot-free.
5180,2020-06-28 13:28:50,hh8xbg,"I cannot imagine Jada's emotion now. Like, when I was 13, a pack of guys tried to drag me someplace, but I escaped, and when I told my mom she simply lost her sh*t. And not just hearing, but actually seeing some dude jerking on your teenage daughter's photo, even as a ""joke""... Thats mindblowing."
5181,2020-06-28 13:20:50,hh8xbg,love her tbh
5182,2020-06-28 13:07:36,hh8xbg,They‚Äôve made the video unlisted and put it on a random channel... They put so much emphasis on providing context (which doesn‚Äôt make it better AT ALL) that they forgot to even apologise...
5183,2020-06-28 13:08:41,hh8xbg,I mean we knew the context all along. It's disturbing and gross.
5184,2020-06-28 13:12:36,hh8xbg,And on an unlisted video.....
5185,2020-06-28 13:45:15,hh8xbg,"I'm sorry, Shane WHAT? How is he not having everything stripped from him the way Laura Lee had?"
5186,2020-06-28 13:48:57,hh8xbg,"I stopped at about 3:25 I think. They say that the other people were like, Mother Teresa, Jesus, Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King, people who weren‚Äôt 17 and murdered. They say that this particular video was made in 2014, Trayvon died in 2012 (according to Wikipedia), so pretty recent, and a teenage boy. Why did they take his name? Why in the FUCKING SHITHELL would they write down his name? He was a fucking TEENAGE BOY. HE WAS SEVENTEEN. HE WAS MURDERED AND THE MURDERER WALKED FREE. FUCK YOU SNFNFNFFNDH I need to calm down. Sorry for flipping. This is just the worst ‚Äúdefense‚Äù and they should have thought for a while before making a video god damn how stupid are they? Defending this? Ekfjgjcmdjf"
5187,2020-06-28 13:19:54,hh8xbg,"/u/sleepycaterpillar can this get added? They've made it unlisted so they can try to brush their involvement under the rug and barely even apologized, I'd hate for this to get buried in the thread."
5188,2020-06-28 13:29:34,hh8xbg,"They were adults who purposefully wrote his name and put it in the pot. The skit was called ""talking shit"".....even them trying to ""add context"" didn't help their case. Just more info about who Shane associates/associated with and him and  anyone he knows are trash people.

They're the ones who should probably start looking for a job since their YouTube careers are over."

5190,2020-06-28 13:08:30,hh8xbg,This!! And the video is unlisted. They really did that.
5191,2020-06-28 21:39:37,hh8xbg,"I don't think James Charles is gross in all this. He seems to be minding his own business, tanning his cheeks in assless chaps, and Jeffree Star keeps sending incompetent assassins to snipe him."
5192,2020-06-28 21:12:32,hh8xbg,What JC (James Charles) allegations? I've read both recaps but think I'm missing something. Thanks
5193,2020-06-29 00:06:32,hh8xbg,"Goddamn, why is everyone in the entertainment industry a fucking p\*do."
5194,2020-06-28 23:46:47,hh8xbg,Jesus fucking Christ man
5195,2020-06-28 23:47:32,hh8xbg,Please help me find this
5196,2020-06-28 23:43:08,hh8xbg,I Member
5197,2020-06-29 21:29:52,hh8xbg,"Absolutely. I feel like we keep forgetting that this is the same exact ""evidence"" that was being spoken about last time around. It had no validity then, just because J* brought it up again doesn't change that."
5198,2020-06-29 21:53:04,hh8xbg,Honestly I‚Äôm now wavering towards ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it exists‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs completely fabricated‚Äù given only two people have verified they heard it.
5199,2020-06-29 21:38:53,hh8xbg,"I think he does..that or he‚Äôs already had a discussion with the person who sent the voice memo and they‚Äôve told him not to worry/it was blown out of proportion or something like that (which, to be fair, unfortunately doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that it *was* actually blown out of proportion. They could just be saying that to make it go away)."

5201,2020-06-30 00:25:19,hh8xbg,"I wish JC would just tweet ‚Äúthere is no recording‚Äù. And leave it at that. Don‚Äôt talk about it more, don‚Äôt add anything else. Just give that amount of information, so Jeffree Weinstein‚Äôs current defense team erupts."
5202,2020-06-28 20:47:56,hh8xbg,So he's lost .55% of his subscribers lol
5203,2020-06-29 10:55:20,hh8xbg,"Kati Morton needs her psychotherapist licence reviewed, if indeed she has a licence."
5204,2020-06-29 11:08:32,hh8xbg,Eugenia Cooney's whole situation is sofa king upsetting. :( So many people on YT have profited off of her.
5205,2020-06-29 11:46:42,hh8xbg,"Her ‚Äúfriends‚Äù were not trying to help. Kati Morton may have been the ring leader, but they‚Äôre not clueless and they‚Äôre not innocent. I don‚Äôt think she has anyone in her life actually trying to help her."
5206,2020-06-29 17:32:02,hh8xbg,"Yep, Blaire basically shit on the floor and peaced out. What a mess. The only person who benefits from this is Joffree."
5207,2020-06-29 17:30:30,hh8xbg,"He 100% manipulated her, I lost a ton of respect for her after making this video."
5208,2020-06-29 18:13:44,hh8xbg,Yeah I cannot be convinced that this isn't exactly what Jason Shathouse wanted. Like I was thinking about it last night and I feel like even the 'omg he's facetiming me I don't want to talk to u jefre!!!1' ig story was staged. I'm in full tinfoil hat thorough conspiracy mode on this one

5213,2020-06-29 22:28:38,hh8xbg,Ooo JS in a catch 22! Waiting to see if he breaks his radio silence or not.
5214,2020-06-29 22:26:56,hh8xbg,I said this when the collab was coming out. But why buy makeup from a guy who‚Äôs trademark is not showering. Poor quality just seems part of the package.

5218,2020-06-28 09:27:10,hh8xbg,We have to owe the Smiths for speaking up. Now if they want to bring down Jafar too...
5219,2020-06-28 11:04:40,hh8xbg,"I am waiting on a big celebrity to call J\* out. The Smith family brought a lot of attention to Shane Dawson and his atrocities, so I am hoping another high-power celeb comes out and calls Jafar Cosmic Douche out."
5220,2020-06-28 11:38:50,hh8xbg,"Shane is the last horcrux I think. J* is next, only a matter of time lol"
5221,2020-06-28 11:03:24,hh8xbg,"Now all the attention is shifted towards Shane, away from him. How convenient."
5222,2020-06-28 10:59:33,hh8xbg,"Maybe but on the other hand who knew Shane would be cancelled this hard? By the Smith family (and rightfully so). 

Miss Fame spoke out against J* and i have been seeing some youtubers say they do not use his products anymore. So i feel like it is going to happen. Maybe he will always have stans, but his brand will take a hit."
5223,2020-06-28 10:59:48,hh8xbg,"I know, right? Every time someone goes down, J* is always in the mix. Am I the only one who sees this? Argh!"
5224,2020-06-28 16:44:22,hh8xbg,I‚Äôd pull out the wine too if it wasn‚Äôt like 1230 in the afternoon here.
5225,2020-06-28 16:43:07,hh8xbg,What are you cooking ??
5226,2020-06-28 16:49:55,hh8xbg,ooh what wine are you having? I'm pouring myself a sauvignon blanc right now

5228,2020-06-28 19:01:10,hh8xbg,"Has everyone forgotten that James says in No More Lies that he's ""still a virgin""? Do people think James is lying about that? Even though he is the one who's been living clean after dramageddon II: electric boogaloo? Even though Jeffree was the one who said that he wouldn't insert himself into more drama, yet has been going door to door to spread more rumors about a hypothetical voice memo, and going on Chris Hansen's show to talk about Dahvie Vanity but trying to talk about other shit instead? 


Like am I dreaming? Have I been sent back to May 2019?"
5229,2020-06-28 19:34:13,hh8xbg,"Going to the police is up to the victim. Assuming this happened, this person is in an awful situation. If they go to the police, it's a potentially traumatizing process that is unlikely to result in legal repercussions for James and may or may not hurt his platform. If they don't, there's no proof, no way for people to know if a victim even exists or if it's true, and James might hurt someone else."
5230,2020-06-28 19:51:16,hh8xbg,"I wish it were as simple as just going to the police, but it‚Äôs not. In sexual assault allegations, physical evidence is often non-existent. Just because you‚Äôre accused doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre going to lock you up - the process is slow and tedious and difficult. If the only evidence here is a voice memo and hearsay (AND the victim just wants this to go away), going to the police will do little to no good (and will then re-traumatize the victim). I know you‚Äôre coming from a good place and I‚Äôm not trying to shit on you at all, I‚Äôm just saying going to the police is not a fix all and it often doesn‚Äôt accomplish much of anything ESPECIALLY if the alleged victim doesn‚Äôt want it, which it appears in this case they don‚Äôt. The only thing one can really do in this situation is reach out to the victim and lend support, and take their cues on how they want to proceed, if at all. It‚Äôs exceedingly rare for SA allegations to make it through the court system or even get to the point of charging the perpetrator, and the whole process is a literal nightmare. A lot of these instances are he said/she said (so to speak), which it appears to be here, and the victim‚Äôs credibility is often scrutinized and attacked. I wish it was easier, but having worked with lots of SA victims, I wouldn‚Äôt blame anyone for just wanting to move on with their lives, because the odds are piled as high as a mountain against them."
5231,2020-06-28 19:25:01,hh8xbg,Thissssss
5232,2020-06-28 19:29:54,hh8xbg,That might end Shane but not J*. He's a cockroach who even survived Myspace.
5233,2020-06-28 19:33:12,hh8xbg,Honestly not a single YouTube community i follow has a fraction of BG drama.
5234,2020-06-28 20:46:57,hh8xbg,Noooo I need my kitten compilations/Sims Murder Mansion videos!
5235,2020-06-28 19:46:31,hh8xbg,The video of him just mocking the guy throwing up and yelling at the homeless person are so disturbing. It's a whole other level of depravity.
5236,2020-06-28 19:39:44,hh8xbg,"How do you think he got to where he is now. To get to the top you have claw your way through. I understand being selfmade but most of these millionaires got to the top by doing some shady, nasty and dirty shit. Allegedly."
5237,2020-06-28 19:52:12,hh8xbg,There‚Äôs still folks tweeting out their jsc purchases and looks completely oblivious to the vitriol surrounding S and J. Either they‚Äôre completely clueless or dgaf. Jafar might lose some subs but he‚Äôll always have his stans sadly.
5238,2020-06-28 19:51:08,hh8xbg,why does it seem that shane still has the same number tho?ü§¢
5239,2020-06-28 22:28:31,hh8xbg,the vlog squad is gross but I think a p*do who built his platform on being creepy/racist deserves to be dragged more. Trisha is just sad that the only reason why people tolerate her (Shane) is cancelled
5240,2020-06-28 22:35:53,hh8xbg,[deleted]
5241,2020-06-28 22:46:24,hh8xbg,Oh God some people really need to just sit down and eat their food.
5242,2020-06-28 22:31:55,hh8xbg,"She has valid point about the vlog squad but other than that she can do one as well. She's not ok with it now it's all come to a head but she's been fine with it before that. She can't pretend she didn't know anything about all of this, she's been friends with Shane throughout him making all of these videos."
5243,2020-06-28 22:41:21,hh8xbg,This is the definition of too little too late lol. And pushing her anti-Vlog Squad agenda in the very same tweet? She needs to log off and count her blessings for still having a career at this point.
5244,2020-06-28 23:47:16,hh8xbg,"This is gonna be very problematic on this sub, but the Vlog Squad shouldn‚Äôt escape judgement. Both David and Liza have done racist mockeries of Asian people. David has said the n word. Jason has said the n word. Brandon slept with a whole 17 year old. They all go and party at colleges while not attending those (or any) colleges. Trisha is trash and should be called out as such, but some people acting like her being problematic is reason enough to not cancel Vlog Squad is ignorant. They are all trash and all of them, David and the funky bunch included, should be cancelled. Who cares what Trisha‚Äôs motives were, David and co STILL said and did those things! They need to be held accountable just like Shane and Jeffree and Trisha."
5245,2020-06-28 22:30:42,hh8xbg,And someone responded under that comment with a video of her using the nword. oof
5246,2020-06-28 22:28:02,hh8xbg,Trisha is a trash bag herself. And Shane‚Äôs apology sucked.
5247,2020-06-28 22:29:54,hh8xbg,How can she be such a clown?
5248,2020-06-28 22:37:29,hh8xbg,Trisha has no leg to stand on. Ive decided im not gonna even bother watching videos coming from her.
5249,2020-06-28 22:44:04,hh8xbg,oh thankgoodness she said something! i can blow out my candle now! seriously Tuna Problem is far too old to be involved in any of the stuff she's always involved in or commenting on.
5250,2020-06-28 22:34:16,hh8xbg,She should be the one apologizing. For standing by and supporting Shane all these years. There‚Äôs even pics online of her at family parties with Shane‚Äôs (weird ass) mom.
5251,2020-06-28 23:09:46,hh8xbg,"I‚Äôm curious when she plans to apologize for being a sexual predator. Repeatedly flashing her breasts and vagina to people on Twitter and in person when she‚Äôs throwing a tempter tantrum. Admittedly abusing her partners emotionally, physically, and sexually. Pretending she‚Äôs black, transgender, and suffering from DID."
5252,2020-06-28 23:33:57,hh8xbg,"Phil also regularly defended boogie2988, even after boogie and a group of men went to a feminist's panel, because they deemed her problematic, and trolled/intimidated her throughout it. Phil claimed he didn't agree with the actions while still defending him. Phil regularly called Shane and Boogie ""the nicest guy on the internet"". He's such trash.

**Edit:** just adding a link to my previous comment responding to someone asking [why Phil is problematic](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyGuruChatter/comments/hd3kmb/shane_dawson_and_jeffree_star_megathread_4/fvm5dfj?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)."
5253,2020-06-28 23:08:22,hh8xbg,"Oof I just got off work and I‚Äôm not home yet, tldr on which Phil?"
5254,2020-06-28 23:10:44,hh8xbg,They‚Äôre thinking mr beast is non problematic lol

5256,2020-06-29 03:43:11,hh8xbg,"I think his twitter apology was a huge misstep. He should have stayed quiet. Then actually seek education from professionals and put in the work and come back with an apology that actually takes accountability, severs ties to JS and His other terrible friends, and spend the next several months working towards change."
5257,2020-06-29 03:33:25,hh8xbg,"If he hadn‚Äôt posted his ‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving the community‚Äù rant and he had never posted the apology video, he would be in the clear now (from a PR standpoint)."
5258,2020-06-29 03:46:56,hh8xbg,Yes and no. I think with the BLM movement many people are (rightfully) reexamining who they support and with covid most people are online a whole lot more than before. So I think his ultimate cancellation was inevitable because this horrendous stuff is out there. Do I think he sped up the process by releasing a terrible apology? Absolutely. But Jeffree was already being called out by his ex-friends so I feel like Shane was always going to be next.
5259,2020-06-29 03:35:05,hh8xbg,"no he has been accused of predatory behavior before, its not NEW but since there is so much drama happening at the same time it got way bigger than it did last time 

his career was going to come undone through that or j\* and now its both"
5260,2020-06-29 04:10:40,hh8xbg,It would've come out eventually imo
5261,2020-06-29 05:58:33,hh8xbg,I‚Äôm a bit conflicted on this because I do think he would have gotten all this because people found the Willow clip before the apology video. My guess is that Jada sat on it though to see what he would say hence why her tweet sounded the way it did. So maybe if it was a better apology video the Smiths may have done/said something else?
5262,2020-06-29 03:27:30,hh8xbg,"Idk if I want to say that for sure, but it's undeniably a real possibility."

5264,2020-06-29 12:45:44,hh8xbg,Hopefully lawyers tbh
5265,2020-06-29 12:29:37,hh8xbg,Probably lawyers
5266,2020-06-29 17:22:08,hh8xbg,"Lord, imagine knowing that Will Smith thinks you're trash. If I was Shane I would take my ""poor mans"" millions and go into hiding forever."
5267,2020-06-29 13:43:41,hh8xbg,"Shane is very emotional, he has had outbursts before from people fat shaming him, from that cat interview and whatnot. As much as I disapprove of Jafar, this was actually typical Shane being Shane."
5268,2020-06-29 16:32:16,hh8xbg,I was today years old when I learned that Shane Dawson's real last name is Yaw.

5274,2020-06-29 23:46:22,hh8xbg,I like how the people they interviewed mentioned other beauty gurus they liked that weren‚Äôt so problematic. I think that‚Äôs a small but strong step in the right direction.
5275,2020-06-30 01:31:27,hh8xbg,lol if they were JCs victims wouldnt he already know they are? its not outing them
5276,2020-06-30 01:58:39,hh8xbg,"It‚Äôs been talked about, but there‚Äôs almost 10000 comments in this thread so it got buried"
5277,2020-06-30 01:57:16,hh8xbg,Yes! That video is so interesting. It really does show his nastier personality traits. I think people are passing it over because it's so old and seems disconnected from the current drama.
5278,2020-06-30 02:43:15,hh8xbg,He mentioned it in his apology video too!
5279,2020-06-30 02:50:36,hh8xbg,"He's such a fucking sweetheart. IDK if it's shade or not, but I very much appreciate his sentiment."
5280,2020-06-30 02:42:04,hh8xbg,I was thinking that myself.  That and the fact that he posted an ‚Äúemergency good vibes tweet.‚Äù  I wouldn‚Äôt call that shade but more like.. subtly acknowledging what‚Äôs going on I guess.

5290,2020-06-28 19:06:36,hh8xbg,"I think partly he's afraid, but I also think- like Blaire suggested, he's using it as a tool to get people on his side. I doubt he really cares for the victim but knows if he outed them he'd face immense backlash."
5291,2020-06-28 19:01:19,hh8xbg,"I either think James hired lawyers to stop the voice memo and threats, or it doesn‚Äôt exist."
5292,2020-06-28 19:03:17,hh8xbg,Probably legal reasons
5293,2020-06-28 20:15:31,hh8xbg,Him and rich and Dustin were all on their high horses after they pledged their allegiances to Jeff & Shane during dramageddon 2 and look at these fools now

Sanders has been around the block and is usually trustworthy. Has its own biases but is anti J\* so I like m"
5296,2020-06-29 18:56:31,hh8xbg,He teases big revelations a lot and often is no new info. Its usually interesting but still let down to the hype he gives it.

5335,2020-06-29 15:47:37,hh8xbg,"idk, people are complicated, we have the benefit of not knowing him personally so it's easy to take his comments and problematic behavior for what they are, but it's hard to detach yourself from someone that you're choosing to spend your life with, especially if they have shown some change over the years. I can sympathize with that.

I mean, I get where you're coming from, absolutely, it's just going to take a lot longer than a week to make this decision. It's not just their channels, leaving him would change their entire lives, it takes some logistics here."
5336,2020-06-29 16:15:29,hh8xbg,I think Ryland is at the v least complicit. I didn't save the image but I'm pretty sure there's a pic out there of him wearing or standing next to shane wearing Shane's shanaynay merch.
5337,2020-06-29 15:51:11,hh8xbg,"I agree with you but you‚Äôll notice that some people tend to excuse them (and his past friends while go after Shane‚Äôs ex-gf which is kind of hilarious, but I get it she has a paper trail). Unless Ryland is a naive person, which I don‚Äôt think he is, he knows exactly about Shane‚Äôs bad sides and of course his past. He has chosen to stay with him still. Given that Garett and all the other friends he recently lost were friends with him at the height of his shittiness, only now shading him, I think it‚Äôs because is personal, not because they saw how Shane is and then bounced. 

Shane is Morgan and Ryland‚Äôs cash cow and they will not bite the hand that feeds them, unless Shane does something to them, In my opinion."
5338,2020-06-29 15:42:13,hh8xbg,"I'm with you, i don't get it. Even if you can't choose your brothers partner you didn't have to be so close with him either. I'm having a hard time believing they didn't know bc they're old enough to have watched YouTube while he was THE content creator to watch while putting out his racist sexual videos on shane Dawson tv"
5339,2020-06-29 18:41:24,hh8xbg,Idk I feel bad expecting people to make big life decisions based on things that come out online. If they‚Äôre engaged or living together that‚Äôs kind of something they need to talk through before making any decisions. Expecting Ryland to just dump Shane doesn‚Äôt seem fair to Ryland (not that Shane doesn‚Äôt deserve it). I‚Äôm not saying people can‚Äôt call Ryland out on supporting Shane or even being knowledgeable/complicit but that‚Äôs kind of a big ask

By the way, when pedo‚Äôs collect videos those are trophies they can get off on over, and over, and over again. And to top that off, Shane got to have it all online for the entire world to see for nearly a decade. Talk about getting his rocks off right?"

I wouldn't be surprised if there's a Cease and Desist being drafted about that memo, though, because either it exists and should not be being spread around as Tea and thus the victim would want J\* to knock that shit off, or that memo doesn't exist and JC would want Jafar and his camp to stop spreading false accusations of sexual assault about him.

ETA: or, on the nebulous third hand, that memo exists but it's not credible evidence, and thus both Mystery Person (or Persons) and JC would be drafting those ""STFU"" documents."
5417,2020-06-30 01:28:43,hh8xbg,"Either that, or I‚Äôm guessing he‚Äôll know if he talks now we‚Äôll go after him."
5418,2020-06-30 02:25:57,hh8xbg,"Her video's really well done from a 'I used to be a fan of his' perspective, too, considering how many people must've just watched his conspiracy/documentary videos and not looked any deeper into his content."

5420,2020-06-28 06:34:16,hh8xbg,"On Ryland, most people think he‚Äôs in it for the money

And yeah it‚Äôs gonna be tough for Shane, no one will wanna collab with him, his movie is like DOA, any merch is gonna rot on the shelves, his videos if he still makes any will always be scorned. So even if he somehow escapes full cancellation his career is effectively over or least the phase where he was popular"
5421,2020-06-28 06:37:23,hh8xbg,"I never thought Ryland was only there for money but now... it kinda makes sense. In general, Shane is very negative to be around. All he does is bitch and complain, hates himself and talks shit nonstop. He‚Äôs basically proved to everyone he won‚Äôt change. Very interested to see what will happen."
5422,2020-06-28 07:27:41,hh8xbg,I think the reason no one is saying anything about that is because i‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs about Jeffree telling everyone James Charles is an abuser but no one wants to out someone else‚Äôs story

5469,2020-06-28 20:44:24,hh8xbg,D'Angelo Wallace is a great youtuber and I trust his judgment tbh. He grew so much. I started watching him for his art. He's slowly turning into a commentary channel and I'm all in for it. Him calling out shallon Lester on her predatory behavior too 2 months ago!! I feel like he's using his platform for good.
5470,2020-06-28 20:40:23,hh8xbg,"Unwittingly so, she did do just that. I think her initial intention was to do this to detract the attention off of Shane however she played herself."

I can fool my brother in thinking I‚Äôm my mom on the phone. Unless this person has some really aggressively distinct way of talking (which is still questionable because people are fully capable of doing impressions) how can you call a voice note credible?
5480,2020-06-29 18:12:17,hh8xbg,"Especially the claim about r*pe that she even said she didn't have proof of, yet thinks the claim is still credible? Like, what?

And then everyone who's been demanding that the alleged victim come forward with the proof like we're fucking entitled to it?

5516,2020-06-28 17:02:29,hh8xbg,">I was (unsubscribed recently) relatively new to the channel, and I began watching him during the food-tasting, conspiracy theories phase.

I remember Shane Dawson on and off in high school (back in the mid 2000's) but only recently started looking again when he did the video on Graveyard girl's video. I thought it was a pretty cool idea for a series. Talking to old YT-ers and calling them out on their past or mistakes they've made. It could have been a really awesome thing.

Instead, we get the Jake Paul, Tana, and J\* videos which as you said, just ended up as 'look how relatable we are, we have so many problems, you should feel sorry for us' type videos where Shane only built them up instead of really calling them out.

It's kind of sad if you think about it because you could argue that these people essentially used Shane to make themselves look better and now that Shane is the one in hot water his so-called family is like ""Sorry dude you're on your own"""
5517,2020-06-28 19:06:32,hh8xbg,true. i'm all for believing and protecting victims but in this case there's not victim actually speaking up. it's just rumors and manipulation and teasing a supposed voice memo that 1)we havent heard and 2) we dont even know if it exists. like how are we supposed to believe it's true when there's absolutely NO REAL PROOF. aside from the fact that the people that claim to have heard the voice memo parade around saying it's true and how afwul it is but still dont take any real action ???

5548,2020-06-29 02:16:59,hh8xbg,"I love him also, and that would be amazing."
5549,2020-06-29 14:33:48,hh8xbg,"This! I'm so disappointed with him. First he said he didn't really care about JC, then when JC followed him on twitter he said him 'King' already. Idk why this make me feel off. Maybe it just me, idk if the tweet still available, but i dont like the way he handle all of this attention at all :("
5550,2020-06-29 14:16:02,hh8xbg,Already commented but this actually bothers me a lot?!?? I don‚Äôt know why. I don‚Äôt think he has good intentions at all.
5551,2020-06-29 14:58:23,hh8xbg,"Yes, it's incredibly irresponsible."
5552,2020-06-29 14:06:25,hh8xbg,"I don‚Äôt like the sound of him. It sounds like he‚Äôs doing that to be spiteful rather than actual concern. There‚Äôs no reasonable reason for the FBI to get involved, he‚Äôs escalating it for the drama."
5553,2020-06-29 14:13:21,hh8xbg,"It seems like Liam is now trying to start a shane and jeffree witch hunt. Yes, they need to be held accountable. But the FBI? come on üôÑ"
5554,2020-06-29 14:01:50,hh8xbg,"Amen lol. He seems a littletoo invested in this, he needs to take it down a notch or two"
5555,2020-06-29 14:03:01,hh8xbg,"Yea, if you think this is bad, imagine him with a ton of followers and an actual platform. like chile...no...I stopped paying attention to him days ago"
5556,2020-06-29 14:44:03,hh8xbg,i think it's in reference to the voice memo/ allegations that jeffree puts out. he tweeted that after blaire's video so idt it was abt shane

5559,2020-06-29 20:59:34,hh8xbg,2020 is a crazy ass year. I‚Äôve had it officially tbh. These past 6 months have felt like two years lmao
5560,2020-06-29 21:29:04,hh8xbg,"They are both bad. Both are racists, shown predatory behavior and only apologize because it got big. You don't go around and call black people monkeys, the N word, Nazi jokes, making fun of almost every minority, sexualizing children over and over again. They (shane, heffrey and james charles, tana and co are all DRECK. That's why they are/were friends in the first place. White gays have gotten away with attacking Black people/women for a while now while using Black vernacular. Fuck them all and their apologist supporters. This is going on for years now and I'm done. The next person that tries to act funny will get popped. That dumb bitch from last weekend or that white gay guy who thought his sexuality will safe his ass (I'm bi) had to learn the hard way. That's the only language they understand. They can stuff their fake apologies down their throats and choke on it. All of them are bad and have said and done nasty, hurtful things. 

Also fuck those white people who want to tell us (minorities) to forgive. It's not in their place to dictate when we should be offended or when to forgive. This is going on for years now and got normalized as 'edgy' humor now, thanks to popular youtubers and influences."

5563,2020-06-28 09:03:37,hh8xbg,">Hollywood

Blaire White will probably defend Shane and expose Jafar"
5564,2020-06-28 11:25:51,hh8xbg,"I think the worst part is him blaming it on his ‚Äúold self‚Äù and distancing himself from that person, basically avoiding all responsibility. Hell when I was 13 I did some fucked up shit but I acknowledge it was still me and not some arbitrary ‚Äúold self‚Äù."
5565,2020-06-28 11:14:38,hh8xbg,"Yeah exactly I hate that argument of ‚Äúwe all did bad stuff in the past‚Äù the only bad offensive things I can remember doing was saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs gay‚Äù when I was a teenager mid 00s, but I wouldn‚Äôt dream of saying that now. I never did anything remotely near as close to what these 2 have done. The stuff they‚Äôve done isn‚Äôt excuseable in my opinion. They keep using the excuse that the Internet was just like that back then. But it wasn‚Äôt... I mean people said more offensive stuff but going as far as they did still wasn‚Äôt seen as ok. I remember slut shaming and things like that were seen as okay back then but racism and pedophilic shit definitely wasn‚Äôt. Thankfully slut shaming is now frowned upon too thank god"
5566,2020-06-28 11:31:55,hh8xbg,"Trisha's been trying to distract and deflect trying to draw attention on other drama going on, I think that was her way of supporting."

5568,2020-06-28 12:14:57,hh8xbg,I agree Jeffree supporting Shane right now would do more damage to Shane. Plus although people were mostly after Jeffree this cancelgeddon Shane did all these things himself as a grownup and Jeffree is in no way shape or form a good person but that doesn‚Äôt mean that he isn‚Äôt disgusted by his friend like we all are. I wouldn‚Äôt support him over this either if I was him
5569,2020-06-28 16:24:09,hh8xbg,I‚Äôm now nearly convinced shes just gonna release old tea that we‚Äôve all known for months.
5570,2020-06-28 16:26:37,hh8xbg,Right?? I‚Äôve just seen her IG stories. I‚Äôm skeptical. She better pull up some new RECEIPTSS

5572,2020-06-28 16:27:47,hh8xbg,She is a trans person who made her career by trashing other trans people.  I really wish people would stop giving her attention in this situation.  It's the most relevant she's been since 2015.
5573,2020-06-28 16:25:09,hh8xbg,"Depending on what is actually in the video, I‚Äôd feel the same way if I were about to expose a powerful figure. Just the thought of what the public might say or said public figure might do. Yes she‚Äôs exaggerating but it may be just how she feels."
5574,2020-06-28 17:37:55,hh8xbg,I wouldn't put it beneath him.
5575,2020-06-28 17:45:36,hh8xbg,Seems like something that scumbag would do.
5576,2020-06-28 18:58:18,hh8xbg,I still won't believe her unless there's solid proof.
5577,2020-06-28 19:04:19,hh8xbg,‚ÄúCommon knowledge‚Äù spread by Jeffree Star with his voice memo. That doesn‚Äôt make it credible.
5578,2020-06-28 19:05:11,hh8xbg,"""Lots of people are backing me up in private messages.""

Sis. Did you buy this from message board flame wars in 2001?"
5579,2020-06-28 19:09:34,hh8xbg,Next she'll tell us that we're interrogating the text from the wrong perspective.
5580,2020-06-28 19:01:46,hh8xbg,Take into consideration this Blaire person is the only person to say they‚Äôve seen it and at quite a convenient time. It could possible not even be real.
5581,2020-06-28 19:05:07,hh8xbg,How does he have this voice memo? Why is anyone confiding in Jafar ?
5582,2020-06-28 19:13:10,hh8xbg,I think it's only safe to say that J* is a shitty friend and a blackmailer. Anything further requires me to believe people I do not know to be trustworthy.
5583,2020-06-28 21:55:45,hh8xbg,On Twitter or YouTube?
5584,2020-06-28 22:06:21,hh8xbg,"On a purely manipulative level, if he releases it then he can't use it behind the scenes anymore. I mean he can say that it's not his story, blah blah, but I feel like that's the real reason."
5585,2020-06-28 22:08:24,hh8xbg,I hope it doesnt get released unless the victim is the one releasing it because they want to come forward . Otherwise I am taking everything with a grain of salt.
5586,2020-06-28 22:35:43,hh8xbg,"I very much doubt the voice note is from any SA victim, I just can't see the logic in them detailing their assault to him in a voice note that they know he could use maliciously (like he has done). Its got to be a third party recanting another person's SA."
5587,2020-06-29 01:45:35,hh8xbg,He did the same with Rebecca black. In petty paiges last video about Shane she played loads of clips of Shane talking about her body etc when she was underage it‚Äôs disgusting
5588,2020-06-29 01:47:40,hh8xbg,Omg thank you for sharing. There were so many digs about how long his video was lmao
5589,2020-06-29 04:51:25,hh8xbg,Omg I‚Äôve loved him since he called out Trisha‚Äôs BS on her DID videos.
5590,2020-06-29 07:00:59,hh8xbg,"Idk if that‚Äôs important, but I‚Äôm upvoting because that is impressive attention to detail."
5591,2020-06-29 07:10:41,hh8xbg,Yes he posted on insta like an hour or more ago and like a few tweets. He was having shots last night so he could be hungover.
5592,2020-06-29 10:53:20,hh8xbg,"She just said she likes him, she doesn't talk about it that much"
5593,2020-06-29 11:07:12,hh8xbg,I think it‚Äôs because recently it came out that Jeffree was *shocker* talking shit about Trisha during their Valentine‚Äôs Day trip. He told some other person (who made a video I think) that Trisha is fat and talked about her skin. I‚Äôm assuming Trisha wants to just stay in his good graces because lord knows he would destroy her small fan base in a heartbeat.
5594,2020-06-29 10:45:13,hh8xbg,"I‚Äôll do it, is it on Spotify?"
5595,2020-06-29 19:56:25,hh8xbg,Oh yeah n I feel dumb as shit for letting him boil me like a fucking frog
5596,2020-06-29 20:00:24,hh8xbg,What does dog whistle mean? Excuse my ignorance lol
5597,2020-06-29 19:55:36,hh8xbg,Lol
5598,2020-06-29 20:44:29,hh8xbg,"She's been getting called out on twitter, I remember in priminks thread he definitely said she should be held responsible for her part, I think she also put out a statement."
5599,2020-06-29 20:42:20,hh8xbg,It‚Äôs probably cause she already released a statement on her twitter owning up to it
5600,2020-06-29 20:43:10,hh8xbg,"Tbh I am all for cancelling S\* and J\* but that's Shane's cousin who was in videos with him and the shock value of their jokes was that she was young. Her mom / his aunt was aware and she even set up her own channel for a few videos.

&#x200B;

The video is absolutely not ok, but Shane's family was always very NSFW and his cousin was part of that culture. That being said, a 12 year old probably doesn't understand the implications of everything and she might be really uncomfortable looking back as an adult. Or she may not care, it's her cousin.

&#x200B;

Wasn't there so I can't speak on it, but I watched every single one of his videos during that era. Looking back he was insanely immature, but that's what appealed to people and why he had an audience."
5601,2020-06-29 21:27:50,hh8xbg,He's adorable
5602,2020-06-29 21:18:07,hh8xbg,Maybe it‚Äôs just my English brain but most american commentary channels talk so slow... I gotta watch their videos on 2x speed
5603,2020-06-29 23:35:51,hh8xbg,"Tati, James, and Jeffree have headshot photos and then there's Shane with an eye half open, unshowered, in robe (aka in his natural state)"
5604,2020-06-29 23:33:08,hh8xbg,I saw the thumbnail and was like that‚Äôs a... CHOICE
5605,2020-06-29 23:38:08,hh8xbg,I cannot stand when phil wears merch he clearly would never wear irl. There's no buttons or collar. He looks so uncomfortable
5606,2020-06-29 23:35:04,hh8xbg,That's just what he's been looking like?
5607,2020-06-29 23:38:31,hh8xbg,Aren‚Äôt he and shane friends?
5608,2020-06-30 01:32:18,hh8xbg,"Probably. And some big closed door meetings at YouTube HQ. After all, they posted the content, but YouTube endorsed them, and I can imagine that the Smiths are not too happy with Susan right now."
5609,2020-06-28 07:46:27,hh8xbg,"Search Twitter for j* thread and RT everything, believe me, people are trying."
5610,2020-06-28 19:18:26,hh8xbg,"We have to keep going after him, we need to constantly call him out, every post, every video. If other people won‚Äôt we have to bombard him. If that means I have to make a new twitter every day I will."
5611,2020-06-28 19:18:27,hh8xbg,Jefart. I'm dying.
5612,2020-06-28 19:18:06,hh8xbg,"Jefart Scum.

You won for today. Thank you."
5613,2020-06-28 19:33:07,hh8xbg,On the contrary. Him manipulating another racist youtuber into deflecting attention from him and Shane was a big mistake and I'm guessing will backfire soon!
5614,2020-06-28 20:22:22,hh8xbg,"Even her mannerisms are so J*, when she's all soft spoken then suddenly goes stern"
5615,2020-06-28 20:10:22,hh8xbg,Oh really? Irdk much about her and her past. So essentially is what she is saying about never being friends or well friendly or liking J* actually false if she bought his make up and micmiced him?
5616,2020-06-28 20:11:08,hh8xbg,Gross. I always thought she was trash but didn't know that back story about her.
5617,2020-06-28 20:08:32,hh8xbg,[deleted]
5618,2020-06-28 20:10:38,hh8xbg,"Lol you're reaching. Jeffree star has MANY former fans and currently still has many fans. All this stuff is coming out now. I'm not going to blame anyone for being a fan of his without all the knowledge we have now. 

I don't know when she said that about james but I do distinctly remember her being on the side of james last year when the whole internet turned against him. She tweeted something badly about Tati during that whole thing."
5619,2020-06-29 13:05:16,hh8xbg,that girl needs help or smth
5620,2020-06-29 12:11:15,hh8xbg,She‚Äôs talking shit like she always does
5621,2020-06-29 11:47:06,hh8xbg,What does shadow ban mean?
5622,2020-06-29 12:09:33,hh8xbg,The gag is ... it didn't lmao. Her music video just flopped and she threw a temper tantrum because she couldn't fathom that her music was just bad.
5623,2020-06-30 04:08:34,hh8xbg,"I really liked smokey glows video. It really, like she perfectly explained my feelings on this all."
5624,2020-06-29 19:23:14,hh8xbg,"Where's that user that posted like 300 comments defending Blaire last night? /u/mizerybusiness smth?

Edit: /u/miserybizness"
5625,2020-06-29 19:20:45,hh8xbg,She ONLY cares about J* being manipulative with voice memos and Shane doing things that are inappropriate to kids. She doesn‚Äôt care at all about the racist stuff.
5626,2020-06-29 19:06:37,hh8xbg,six months ago she also did a video doing her makeup and talked about how she used to attend j* concerts and that she wished she was on his makeup PR list because it‚Äôs so good. she also deleted it last week :)
5627,2020-06-29 18:53:55,hh8xbg,THANK YOU! I've been saying that blaire is a freakin' god awful person. I have trouble believing her.
5628,2020-06-29 18:54:55,hh8xbg,"Ugh, throw them all away."
5629,2020-06-29 20:33:07,hh8xbg,"Oh yes, i heard that at five drinks, the nicest people become racist. One drink, a little spacey. Two drinks, loud. three drinks dancing. Four drinks, sexual. Five drinks, racist. Six drinks, crying. Seven drinks, riding horses. 

/s in case it's not obvious that I think shes full of shit."
5630,2020-06-29 21:24:52,hh8xbg,Blaire White is fucking GROSS. I used to follow her to see what ‚Äúthe other side‚Äù was up to but she‚Äôs far beyond being someone with a different opinion to me that I couldn‚Äôt stand to watch her stuff. I‚Äôd say she‚Äôs in the same category as J* in terms of racism.
5631,2020-06-29 19:09:05,hh8xbg,Did people not know Vanessa was the worst before this?
5632,2020-06-29 19:09:18,hh8xbg,Thank you for these receipts!
5633,2020-06-28 18:48:36,hh8xbg,Theres no hard proof of a falling out but they haven't been seen together for almost a year now. Garrett also repeatedly threw some slight shade at Shane so its p clear they're no longer friends.
5634,2020-06-28 18:46:29,hh8xbg,"According to them, they just didn‚Äôt film together as much because Garrett was out of the country for a long time. In Japan, I think."
5635,2020-06-28 20:40:17,hh8xbg,They won't do it. Even if they're forced to respond I don't see them doing anything permanent. They might pull the conspiracy palette because of Shane but I think J* is too much of a moneymaker for them to sever ties with him
5636,2020-06-28 21:04:14,hh8xbg,deadline in decembet??? how about deadline next week lol
5637,2020-06-29 04:02:26,hh8xbg,We just need to take down jafar now
5638,2020-06-30 04:04:40,hh8xbg,‚ÄúThis I‚Äôve come to know‚Äù
5639,2020-06-28 12:19:35,hh8xbg,"Most of them are teenagers who Idolize Shane and think that ""he has changed"" bc he ""apologized"""
5640,2020-06-28 12:09:44,hh8xbg,"Gross, how braindead do you have to be to still be apart of the hivemind?"
5641,2020-06-28 14:10:46,hh8xbg,Imagine telling a mother they should forgive someone who sexualized their 11yr old daughter
5642,2020-06-28 14:10:11,hh8xbg,"Right?! They still picked Trayvon‚Äôs name, edited the footage and put it out into the world. Why do they think we don‚Äôt understand the context, of course we understand it, you‚Äôre just shitty people. Also roasts only work if the jokes are funny, they‚Äôre not comedians they‚Äôre just asshats with a YouTube channel"
5643,2020-06-28 14:18:10,hh8xbg,"Lol justifying at 2 am. They reeked of desperation.

No one needs an explanation,  yeah yeah,  just for jokes,  yeah yeah times were different,  whatever. It's 2020 and that crap is unacceptable. They should have stayed silent,  but if they really feel to speak, then express your regrets of using crappy judgement and poor taste."
5644,2020-06-28 14:32:25,hh8xbg,"I agree. As a victim of childhood sexual abuse, I don‚Äôt feel like I have to accept his apology. His racism is also obviously inexcusable. I‚Äôm all for people learning and growing but he clearly......hasn‚Äôt."
5645,2020-06-28 14:39:04,hh8xbg,"Also a huge majority of the people accepting his apology and saying to get over it, aren't the people who his apology was aimed at lmao. Like if Willow's family doesnt accept it then who are they to tell them to get over it. Same goes for white people telling black people to get over his racist comments, it just doesn't work like that."
5646,2020-06-28 15:38:56,hh8xbg,">I‚Äôve been seeing people say he apologized get over it...

I don't even know how people can consider that an apology. I can call a turd a fucking rose all I want but that doesn't make it a rose."

&#x200B;

even tho this information came from jeffree star who is a known liar and has thrown at least two people under the bus to get more social media status. & yeah like you said he doesn't even know if its true... yet he showed a bunch of people anyway?!??!!?"
5650,2020-06-28 22:03:21,hh8xbg,"Which, imo, is a way to give himself leverage on the situation. If the worst comes and the memo is released and turns out to be false/flimsy evidence, he can claim he was also fooled by it."
5651,2020-06-28 22:16:00,hh8xbg,I hope James will sue his ass for defamation.
5652,2020-06-28 22:08:29,hh8xbg,"Ok. Jockstrap Stain is saying he doesn‚Äôt know if the voice memo is real or not... that‚Äôs how he deflects blame off himself when LATER, he is called into question as to why he didn‚Äôt tell the cops. Cause now he can just say ‚ÄòWell I didn‚Äôt know if it was real so I can‚Äôt give false evidence of a crime to the cops can I?‚Äô It‚Äôs just another manipulation tactic he fed to Blaire and she ate it up."
5653,2020-06-28 23:08:42,hh8xbg,That sure as hell didn't stop Jeffree from sharing it with who knows how many people.
5654,2020-06-28 21:57:24,hh8xbg,That‚Äôs what blows my mind.
5655,2020-06-28 22:33:06,hh8xbg,I think it's because being a villian is part of Jafar's persona so when he's shitty it's seen as ok. Shame's persona is uwu sensitive empath that's so poor. So it's hurting him more.
5656,2020-06-29 00:19:27,hh8xbg,"I emailed morphe with a similar expression. Will they listen? Probably not, but if enough of us express our concerns they might hear us"

5663,2020-06-29 09:46:02,hh8xbg,She is...um...having a hard time. We are not allowed to speculate on anyone‚Äôs mental health but I think we can all see she needs help.

5666,2020-06-29 20:15:49,hh8xbg,Someone said people are no longer stanning jeffracial slur because he's a bad friend. So I 100% believe that title.
5667,2020-06-29 19:40:41,hh8xbg,That was a fantastic video.
5668,2020-06-29 19:14:24,hh8xbg,"Oh, I love Kat Blaque! She always makes me think in ways that I wouldn't have otherwise"
5669,2020-06-29 19:33:35,hh8xbg,Just finished it. Love her tbh.
5670,2020-06-29 19:03:58,hh8xbg,I‚Äôm so watching this once I‚Äôm off work
5671,2020-06-28 20:16:38,hh8xbg,"Yeah this is some deep stuff, I wouldn't even call it drama anymore. It's just messy and hard to digest everything that is coming out."
5672,2020-06-28 19:59:25,hh8xbg,"literally, i‚Äôm so worn out by it all now it wasn‚Äôt really ‚Äúfun‚Äù it was just interesting to see how things turned for shane ://"
5673,2020-06-28 21:05:39,hh8xbg,"Yeah, some of the beauty drama was entertaining in the past but all this now is just sad and awful."
5674,2020-06-29 12:58:30,hh8xbg,the fact that jeffree said he‚Äôd share it to the moms basement hosts but then backtracked once they agreed just stinks of bluffing to me

5676,2020-06-29 12:57:12,hh8xbg,"See, Bl@ire says that J* ""showed me the receipts of a voicenote "". She doesn't say that she has heard the voice note in those exact words - only proof of the existence of the voice note ."
5677,2020-06-29 12:57:06,hh8xbg,"exactly, liam think it's fake that's why legally he can't go public with it"
5678,2020-06-29 13:35:11,hh8xbg,"I have a bit of a different take. At this point, everyone basically knows who the voice memo is allegedly from. If it didn't exist, if the alleged victim was not a victim at all and all of this was some sick rumour someone else made up about him, it would not take much time to set the record straight. A simple tweet would do it.

The whole thing makes me ill and I don't trust any individual involved in Dramageddon."
5679,2020-06-29 13:11:22,hh8xbg,If its true it could be a powerplay on a victim to discredit their story before they came forward. Another option is that at that part YouTube/lawyers were already involved and he knew the victim/victims weren‚Äôt coming forward.
5680,2020-06-29 13:01:05,hh8xbg,"Every time I see the word Blaire I expect to see the word witch after it. I do a double take, which annoys me. Then I get annoyed that it isn‚Äôt Witch, it‚Äôs White."
5681,2020-06-28 09:32:04,hh8xbg,"I‚Äôve been thinking about her a lot during this ordeal. They seemed pretty close back in the day, but looking back now he was definitely using her as a prop. She honestly deserved better."
5682,2020-06-29 07:52:22,hh8xbg,I don't believe anything about James that comes from Jeffrey or people he told.
5683,2020-06-29 07:54:44,hh8xbg,Not a coincidence that J* would be coming for him again when he was doing so well again and so close to 20mil. His views are down because of this :(
5684,2020-06-29 07:43:37,hh8xbg,Same. Him liking tweets and everything makes me think nothing can be proven by any voice memo really right? It‚Äôs all rumour just like last year.
5685,2020-06-29 08:26:04,hh8xbg,"This so called voice memo. I don‚Äôt believe it either. From what was said it seems to have come from a 3rd person not the victim. Hence it could be lies or manipulated. 

I want to know 

a) how did you know enough to make this voice memo?

b) did you speak to the victim or James about it and get clarification on what actually happened? Or did you hear th√© Info in the grapevine

c) what do you mean by sexual assault? Did He touch you inappropriately or did he just brush your leg once by accident?

d) can you prove this actually happened? As we saw in Dramagetton 2 a lot of facts were chopped and chunked to fit the Dangerous James narrative but none of the facts were actually true 

e) have you spoke to James about it? Or just told jeffree to make him look bad

f) if he did assault you why haven‚Äôt you spoken to the police? They need to know not some unreliable crackpot on the internet"
5686,2020-06-29 08:20:51,hh8xbg,"Hold up now. I just read an interesting comment from jeffree‚Äôs lapdog Nick Snider that James leaked the name of the guy in the voicemail by posting the text message from Jeff in the ‚Äúno more lies‚Äù video. üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨. I don‚Äôt believe anyone honestly, but I need to see proof before I label anyone anything. Especially from these liars"
5687,2020-06-28 17:10:29,hh8xbg,"That nicole lady literally just wants attention. She doesn't care about Shane, she just wants clout either good or bad."
5688,2020-06-28 17:03:52,hh8xbg,She‚Äôs garbage. Not surprising at all that she would be on the wrong side of this.
5689,2020-06-28 18:41:23,hh8xbg,"Let's take this for what it is - a hypothetical voice memo. Jeff likes to claim that he has receipts but have anyone noticed how he never comes forward with them? Because what I think he means with ""receipts"" is actually extortion/blackmail material such as sextapes (which he is known to have posted of people to isanyoneup) and tea on straight men he's had sex with (which he said HIMSELF in the Shane docuseries)."
5690,2020-06-29 10:20:56,hh8xbg,"I honestly disagree. James did bounce back but he took a hard fall in just one day... WITHOUT ANY PROOF. Shane lost far less than a million subs (if i am not mistaken) in soon to be 2 weeks with around 20 videos proving he is a piece of shit. And i still sadly believe Shane will bounce back this one too, not as gracefully as James but far more graceful than Shane deserves."
5691,2020-06-29 10:32:21,hh8xbg,Spot on.
5692,2020-06-30 02:44:32,hh8xbg,I just hope we all stay in touch after graduating from clown college ü§°
5693,2020-06-30 02:51:53,hh8xbg,"Look, I just don't want 2020 to bring its version of 2016 creepy clowns."
5694,2020-06-28 10:05:59,hh8xbg,"I think this has to be really hard on him, and I think Shane probably isn‚Äôt respecting that and making Ryland baby him."
5695,2020-06-28 10:06:15,hh8xbg,He seems like the only rational person in Shane's social circle. And his experience in celeb gossip will surely come in handy for Shane's image.
5696,2020-06-28 10:10:59,hh8xbg,"ryland just wants to be a super soccer wine mom and this is probably a lot lol

no but seriously,  ryland, Morgan and their family are decent people (in my opinion) so it's gotta stressful and I KNOW Shane is freaking the hell out by being called out by the Smiths. gonna assume he's probably going to take a looooooong hiatus"
5697,2020-06-28 09:59:16,hh8xbg,I fine him very smart so I think he is planning the next step
5698,2020-06-28 10:02:57,hh8xbg,"I think he's either angry about all of this and supporting Shane with asspats, or planning an exit strategy. Probably the first one."
5699,2020-06-28 12:59:12,hh8xbg,I think there is a huge chance they didn‚Äôt watch all of his old content and are in shock to find out how disgusting he really is
5700,2020-06-28 12:00:22,hh8xbg,Oh there is another channel? I thought these videos were on the one he deleted the other day. Jesus it's just never ending.

5706,2020-06-28 18:40:12,hh8xbg,"Yup, we *almost* made the mistake of going too far last year. Let‚Äôs not do that again.

Until there‚Äôs no proof, no assumptions should be made."
5707,2020-06-28 18:40:54,hh8xbg,Yup. More BS as predicted. Typical Blaire.

5709,2020-06-28 19:19:34,hh8xbg,"Not sure if it would be explicitly not permitted because it is a voice memo, but it could trigger the rule of hearsay because it is an out of court statement given for the truth of the matter asserted.  It depends on the content of the voice memo.  This voice memo would be out of court testimony and within our legal system, the defendant has a right to confront their accuser/testimony.  I think it would be more likely that the person who recorded the voice memo could testify to its contents, but only the date of the memo could be put into evidence.  But I might be wrong, the rules of evidence are a mess."

‚Äú a few years ago i approached shane with an idea of how to deal with his racist past, amd how we could spark a conversation about accountability on his channel. He told me that Ryland had to calm him down after reading my idea, it was at that moment that i realized he didn‚Äôt want to be held accountable for his actions and I‚Äôve just sat back and watched everything unfold‚Äù

My heart breaks for mac, he is such a talented creator.

5716,2020-06-29 01:22:01,hh8xbg,"She's just trying to cash grab like always, she's extremely close friends with Blair White. She made an extremely reactionary video response to Shane's Eugenia video because she wanted credit. I should have unfollowed her then honestly. I unfollowed her a month or so ago when she was bragging about going out to a restaurant and saying how she knows she shouldn't but she had wine or something fucked up. I've never watched her blaire videos because she pisses me off and it's always pissed me off that she supports her."

5725,2020-06-28 14:30:33,hh8xbg,"Honestly, I think it‚Äôs the fact that Jafar is keeping his mouth shut that‚Äôs saving him. Shane made a bunch of shitty statements that drama channels are eating up so while everyone is busy eating Shane alive, Jafar is getting forgotten about. And as we can see, Jafar is letting Shane be ruined right now and he declines to comment about anything. Supposedly I think Shane wrote his twitter novel with Jafar‚Äôs support. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if Jafar planned on it making Shane look awful so he could take less of the heat. Not that Shane doesn‚Äôt deserve the heat, of course. It‚Äôs nice to see him finally being called out, I just hope that Jafar isn‚Äôt forgotten about once again."
5726,2020-06-28 14:18:52,hh8xbg,I feel like a lot of it is the same reason why Trump gets away with so much. He does it in the open and never apologizes so people don‚Äôt ever expect him to be good.

5728,2020-06-28 20:20:17,hh8xbg,I caught my breath after hearing that. I understand the context. It's still horrific.
5729,2020-06-28 20:14:19,hh8xbg,"An innocent child was brutally gunned down by a grown ass man. Murdered. And Shane makes light of that. Is that not the definition of privilege? He keeps saying ‚Äúlet me explain the context of this people are cutting the clips to make it sound worse‚Äù. No I‚Äôm sorry that‚Äôs not funny. Never funny. 

There‚Äôs a HUGE difference between dark humor, which by all means go ahead, and then just saying ‚Äúit was a joke‚Äù after you got caught to somehow try to excuse it. 

Dave Chappell discusses these issues in his new special called ‚Äú8:46‚Äù. I laughed, I cried. Shane wishes he had an ounce of that class and empathy."

That was a Steve Greene video. It was a ""shit talking challenge"" and I guess the gist of it was to ""shit talk"" a person that nothing bad should ever be said about. Shane pulled Trayvons name out of a hat or something. I remember a lot of groaning and head shaking about it.¬†

Here's the thing though; he had been a youtuber for a long time. At that point you say ""this is a terrible idea for a video, lets do something else."" Or ""don't upload that.""¬† Going along with it because your 'brand' is to be controversial, is effed up."

5753,2020-06-28 17:40:10,hh8xbg,I agree. I think people will be less willing to jump on James now that last year already happened. Jeffree is evil either way.
5754,2020-06-28 17:41:09,hh8xbg,I don't think J* has any moral objection to sexual assault. He just knows other people do and is willing to use it as blackmail or to take someone down.
5755,2020-06-28 17:42:05,hh8xbg,There was absolutely nothing new in the video. All it did was sway the conversation here and I'm sure in other places away from Shane and back to JC.

5788,2020-06-28 09:37:51,hh8xbg,What happened?! I missed this. Damn 8 hour drive.

5790,2020-06-28 10:54:44,hh8xbg,"I hope his cousin is okay, I don't feel right about their ""relationship"" after seeing those videos."
5791,2020-06-28 14:53:57,hh8xbg,"FUCK I REMEMBER THAT, this just brought me back, wow. I haven‚Äôt even clicked the link, but I remember that her name was Millie and she would say raunchy and inappropriate things, always talking about the extremely graphic sexual things she wanted done on her or do to Shane, things like that a long with drug and violence references. I think they were trying to go for a South Park thing but INCREDIBLY missed the mark. I was probably around 12 or 13 when this came out and even I remember thinking how weird and wrong it was for grown men to write this dialogue and ‚Äòcomedy‚Äô for a child puppet. 
Thinking back on these episodes if Millie was a real child her behavior would be potentially indicative of trauma. I can‚Äôt believe I forgot about all of this. I think the Fine Bros especially should answer for this."
5792,2020-06-28 14:39:59,hh8xbg,Added.
5793,2020-06-28 15:15:54,hh8xbg,Oh my god. I never saw this. Jesus Christ. How can anyone say that they didn‚Äôt know exactly what they were doing? A puppet that appeals to a young audience and teaching kids these things. It‚Äôs so fucked.
5794,2020-06-28 15:44:44,hh8xbg,"Holy fucking shit. Like, I can't even... YIKES.

I only watched a couple of his videos here and there back in the day. I have vague memories of Shanaynay (sp?), and kind of remember Shane being an edgelord. But I've never heard of this puppet thing before, and I'm at a total loss for words.  

Ya'll said he was trash, and I genuinely did not understand. 

MASSIVE TW on this one. There goes my day."
5795,2020-06-30 02:25:27,hh8xbg,"While I‚Äôm not naive enough to believe anyone is perfect at this point, I still maintain he‚Äôs as close to a previous gem that we have on YT."

Keep Garrett Out of This !

5798,2020-06-28 10:59:03,hh8xbg,"Yep. Shane's past wouldn't be on anyone's radar if it wasn't for him associating with them. Even as early as last week, if Shane hadn't defended Geoffrey in that notes app tweet, he may have come out of this okay. Now, he's getting served that empire state building humble pie, and not one of those rats are anywhere to be seen.

Shucks."
5799,2020-06-28 10:59:21,hh8xbg,"Still pisses me off that Jake used the protests to steal. Like dude, you‚Äôre rich, why the fuck are you looting? Other folk out here have NOTHING, they have a reason! He‚Äôs probably sitting comfortably in his mansion while some of these people are sitting in a cell for just trying to survive. He‚Äôs the scum of the earth."
5800,2020-06-28 11:21:01,hh8xbg,It makes me angry that Shane went to patronise Bunny how she needs to be honest and genuine on camera if she wants to advance her career.
5801,2020-06-28 11:01:17,hh8xbg,"Yeah, it just shows the extent of their self-absorption. They aren‚Äôt going to risk their reputations for him because there‚Äôs nothing they could gain from it."
5802,2020-06-28 10:56:05,hh8xbg,Not shocked tbh. Those videos were mutually beneficial and both Shane and those people know that. They gave Shane the most success he's ever had on youtube and he helped their image. Tana had a massive controversy that he capitalized on immediately. Jake has a massive audience that he capitalized on. I don't think they owe him a thing
5803,2020-06-28 11:04:58,hh8xbg,You‚Äôre completely right. They all suck.
5804,2020-06-28 10:57:46,hh8xbg,"What exactly are they supposed to say? If they were to make statements defending Shane, they‚Äôd be dragged to oblivion. I don‚Äôt think that any of them are actual friends. Those videos were mutually beneficial. Shane got the views and the money and the others (Tana) go a chance to redeem themselves. 

So again, what exactly are they supposed to say to such a serious allegation WITH PROOF?"
5805,2020-06-28 14:47:57,hh8xbg,"This is so true. On an objective level, Shane took a massive risk and a lot of criticism to rehab their careers and reputations, and he gets dust in return. Of course, there‚Äôs not much to defend now, but they weren‚Äôt saying much when it was just murky rumors about him maybe conspiring against James, either. 

They can all go, tbh."
5806,2020-06-28 06:35:09,hh8xbg,The majority of this stuff was up until he deleted his Shane Dawson TV channel. It detracts from the disgusting fact that he was still profitting off of this stuff as recently as a day ago to say j* put it out. You can still see horrific shit on his shanaynay channel
5807,2020-06-28 06:32:53,hh8xbg,"I think that jingleheimer schmit is not lifting a finger to protect him or offering any of his minions or whatever you want to call the the ppl he pays or blackmails to do his bidding. Whether he's the puppetmaster? nah, too much credit, he just wants ppl to think he's that ""powerful"""
5808,2020-06-28 06:23:56,hh8xbg,"I think its possible, especially with how it all has ensured the heat largely remains off of J*"
5809,2020-06-28 06:28:12,hh8xbg,J* is the root to all of this. I‚Äôm convinced !
5810,2020-06-28 15:15:55,hh8xbg,I feel like Safiya must be transitioning into something else. I know she just got married but she‚Äôs seemed over YouTube for awhile
5811,2020-06-28 15:38:30,hh8xbg,"I don't know if I'd consider Safiya as part of his inner circle though. To be honest, I don't even know if she even has one, I could've sworn she was best friends with Rob and Corinne but she never said a word about him when he almost died."
5812,2020-06-28 15:17:30,hh8xbg,"I definitely feel jenna was been questioned about her friendship with Shane and for thanking jeffree for makeup on insta, a lot of people are going after eugenia cooney for the same reason at the moment."
5813,2020-06-28 15:19:50,hh8xbg,I've always been really confused by her posting schedule. If you can call it that.
5814,2020-06-28 15:22:44,hh8xbg,"Safiya kinda sat on the fence about the BLM movement so I don‚Äôt see her addressing this. 
I hope Jenna denounces, or at least apologizes, for endorsing j* and Shane content but I don‚Äôt see it happening anytime soon."
5815,2020-06-28 16:13:00,hh8xbg,So Safiya was actually the first BIG influencer affiliated with the beauty community to unfollow Jafar on all platforms. She very quietly did this when black lives matter started heating up and those flag pics were circulating. I‚Äôve not seen anyone pick up on this I think because she got out before anyone was calling for unfollows. I was surprised as her BLM response was kinda blah but honestly low key impressed. Btw I am 100% certain she followed him on both twitter and insta as I was actively looking as I was trying to unsubscribe for those supporting him still.

5817,2020-06-28 15:45:58,hh8xbg,"jfc, petty to bring safiya up. let's bring all of Shane's associates into this! Where is Molly? Drew? Are we gonna look up Andrew's history too?"
5818,2020-06-28 15:21:34,hh8xbg,"per her [twitter](https://twitter.com/safiyajn/status/1276649608643403776?s=20) she sounds like she's having a bit of a time in her personal life:

""because i‚Äôve been going through a lot of stuff off/behind the camera. i‚Äôm trying my best but every time i feel like i try and pull myself up by the bootstraps this year something comes out of nowhere and smacks me back down. but i‚Äôm trying to reset and start filming again""

which tbh, can't fault her. this year has been a long fuckin century."
5819,2020-06-28 19:32:21,hh8xbg,Yep. This is an obvious ploy and so many people are falling for it. White supremacists stick together.
5820,2020-06-28 19:31:59,hh8xbg,"I think this is the first time anyone other than J* has said that they have heard the memo. So it's not proof, but it's just why people are talking about it."
5821,2020-06-28 17:35:16,hh8xbg,Exactly my point. I‚Äôm not falling for this again until we‚Äôve got proof..
5822,2020-06-28 17:44:39,hh8xbg,It's back on James? What happened?
5823,2020-06-28 17:48:18,hh8xbg,They can all be trash.
5824,2020-06-28 17:38:00,hh8xbg,"Yeah this was supposed to be the exposing J* video but I came out of it mostly disgusted with James. I‚Äôm confused, peppermint‚Äôs confused... we‚Äôre all confused."
5825,2020-06-28 16:27:50,hh8xbg,"With every statement, he digs himself into a deeper hole. All I wanna hear is him leaving the internet, that would be the best move right now."
5826,2020-06-28 16:30:18,hh8xbg,"No, not unless it‚Äôs a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking time away from all social media to work on myself/go to therapy‚Äù type of thing.  Each time he‚Äôs spoken up he‚Äôs made things considerably worse for himself."
5827,2020-06-28 18:40:08,hh8xbg,?? Who would be knowing ?
5828,2020-06-28 18:45:04,hh8xbg,"A lie, through and through. As if anyone with knowledge of the situation, firsthand, wouldn't have come forward and said it last year when it was all happening. Unless it happened after it, which I suppose it's a possibility. 

But I doubt that's true, at all."
5829,2020-06-28 18:47:00,hh8xbg,i don't believe he does but he's happy people do think that.  this is all a game to him.  He's a low rent Kathyrn Merteuil wanna be.
5830,2020-06-28 18:55:51,hh8xbg,His dirt seems to be crimes he did to other people... like the ‚Äúdirt‚Äù he put up on the revenge porn sites
5831,2020-06-29 00:26:25,hh8xbg,"Not that he isn‚Äôt sketch as fuck on the racism etc already, but do you mean there are sexual assault allegations against Janky Starfish?"
5832,2020-06-28 09:44:06,hh8xbg,[deleted]
5833,2020-06-28 13:01:10,hh8xbg,"Because to his newer audience he‚Äôs so likeable. He‚Äôs awkward, he has anxiety, he‚Äôs overweight and shy, he doesn‚Äôt claim to be the best or regard himself as some sort of God Guru unlike the others. People see him and feel for him and want to celebrate his success with him. That‚Äôs why it was so easy for everyone to cancel James and want to cancel Jeffree. Many people see James and Jeffree as taking down Voldemort and gurus with inflated egos. Shane doesn‚Äôt portray himself as that as blatantly as the others do so he has an audience that doesn‚Äôt view him as someone with any kind of villainous quality. And this affects the initial reaction from people when the disgusting shit he has done surfaces again."
5834,2020-06-28 13:26:21,hh8xbg,"Its still mainly twitter/reddit/ YouTube dramachannel drama. I honestly think most of his subscribers have only seen his manipulative apology in which he really rushed over the disgusting things he said to or about children. He focused on his background and how his family is disturbed to justify/excuse it.

He focused mainly on the racist issues which he has been called out for prior and ‚Äúforgiven‚Äù so people may feel like he is just being attacked for something he already was sorry for.

Oh and he deleted most of the evidence so a huge part of his casual audience that isn‚Äôt on Twitter/reddit and doesn‚Äôt get drama channels recomended on the homepage of YouTube probably have no clue what is really going on.

But I think Jada and Jaden smith are making sure it will be on the radar of the more casual viewer soon"
5835,2020-06-28 13:01:55,hh8xbg,"I wonder how many subscribers are still sticking around to keep an eye on him for further drama? Like, in case he uploads again or goes on another deleting spree?"
5836,2020-06-28 13:08:21,hh8xbg,He buys followers and subscribers. He‚Äôs made videos on how to do it.
5837,2020-06-28 14:44:39,hh8xbg,"I have depression and anxiety and I‚Äôve never done any of this crazy shit, I usually just sit in my house alone and eat pop tarts and don‚Äôt prey on children."
5838,2020-06-28 14:21:13,hh8xbg,And they've been doing it since last night - I admire their tenacity lol
5839,2020-06-28 14:44:01,hh8xbg,It‚Äôs insanely being commented and people are like DoN‚ÄôT cOPy CoMMenTs.
5840,2020-06-28 15:10:50,hh8xbg,Somebody said that we should ‚Äòtone it down‚Äô especially because Shane is sensitive in the last megathread and got upvotes. I just don‚Äôt even have the energy
5841,2020-06-28 19:37:22,hh8xbg,excuse me he did *what*?
5842,2020-06-28 19:26:31,hh8xbg,Huh?? That did not happen.
5843,2020-06-28 20:42:31,hh8xbg,Eww so fucking gross

5847,2020-06-28 10:07:31,hh8xbg,I've been thinking about that one. I wonder how his parents are feeling about it now.

He was on that podcast to talk about why he was friends with Dahvie Vanity, who sexually abused an 11 year old (who J cyber bullied when she made it public). He brought up the James/Tati bs to distract and it worked on a lot of yall."

5861,2020-06-29 12:06:21,hh8xbg,At this point he just needs to disappear and any publicist will tell you that
5862,2020-06-29 11:49:37,hh8xbg,"I'd be very shocked if Shane makes a video any time soon. I think the best he could do right now is release an apology specifically at the Smith family for that one incident. 

He needs to ditch the whole apology video thing if he ever wants to even try redeem himself. He needs to start taking accountability for everything he's done and not just lump it all together as ""my past behavior"". He's had to many specific instances of repeated black face, pedophile ""jokes"", and other insane behavior. To just say make a single video saying ""that's not me anymore""."
5863,2020-06-29 13:24:35,hh8xbg,"I am not an attorney so if anyone knows this, could the Smiths be preparing to sue Shane Dawson for emotional distress or anything else? The Smiths were quiet until the apology video.  That unearthed some feelings and rightfully so."
5864,2020-06-29 13:24:11,hh8xbg,Rich coming from her when she was part of a lot of it.....
5865,2020-06-29 13:50:08,hh8xbg,"Uhhh she was right alongside him for all of those jokes.

Even to this day she goes on and on about how brilliant and funny he is. What a hypocrite and a coward."
5866,2020-06-29 14:03:36,hh8xbg,Did anyone else never like Lisa? She honestly always rubbed me the wrong way and I don‚Äôt really know why because I was fine with Shame back then.
5867,2020-06-29 13:16:41,hh8xbg,She‚Äôs just as disgusting IMO. Sorry to say she‚Äôs probably going to have kids.

5875,2020-06-28 19:48:13,hh8xbg,"She either played right into J*‚Äôs trap or she‚Äôs on his pay roll. Her recent trends in videos seems to be exposing predators, so I‚Äôm more inclined to believe she foolishly thought she was doing the right thing."
5876,2020-06-28 19:47:25,hh8xbg,I personally think Blaire's video makes J\* look AWFUL because he's clearly been gossiping about someone elses assault story to literally everybody. It's really bizarre.
5877,2020-06-28 19:46:19,hh8xbg,I agree. I think the VM is fake af and she put this out to deflect. She said she reached out to the Vic in the VM but never said if they replied. This is so fucking shady.
5878,2020-06-28 20:19:44,hh8xbg,"No receipt. Not even a screenshot of the conversation w/ jeff. If she was about to do a video on the dahvie situation, and gets called by jeff himself, who was on tour w/ him back then, would you not record the damn conversation ? Maybe she was naive and didn't record it, or she's hiding something. I find this really suspicious."
5879,2020-06-28 19:46:37,hh8xbg,"Why would JS want her to make a video making him out to be someone who uses other people's sexual trauma for his own benefit, though? I'm just really struggling to see how that benefits him when people were already complaining that all the heat was on Shane and not on him. All he had to do was stay quiet. 

Now, if you want to argue that you think she's just making shit up to try and make him look bad and deflect from *Shane*, that would make more sense to me. But I don't get how or why people think that J* looks good after this."
5880,2020-06-28 20:40:42,hh8xbg,"I have no love for Blaire, but I  think she believes exactly what she's saying. She feels like JS unfairly put this burden on her and she wants to put it back on him. JC and the alleged victim(s) are collateral damage."
5881,2020-06-28 19:46:03,hh8xbg,I completely agree. The video seemed to turn fake when she started ‚Äúcrying‚Äù and talking about Shane. Just my opinion.

5902,2020-06-28 11:44:26,hh8xbg,"I think he shouldn't upload anything now. He should go and seek help to really dive deep and understand how events from his past led to where he is today. After he makes some genuine improvement through that process (which I don't expect to be less than a year if not more), he could come back and talk about it to his viewers - about how to cope with trauma in a healthy way etcetera. He could monetise the video and donate all revenue to charities relevant to everything horrible he's done. And that should be his exit from youtube."
5903,2020-06-28 11:54:57,hh8xbg,"preach! I don't wanna see him make this apology and then on Monday it's ""new conspiracy video!!!"" - he needs to take a, minimum 1 year, break and fix himself."

5905,2020-06-28 11:55:31,hh8xbg,"He needs to read some damn Angela Davis.

Seriously, for now he should forget about his platform. Work on himself by committing to therapy and commit to political movements by educating himself. Read Angela Davis, Malcom X, Huey Newton, Walter Rodney, Michael Parenti. Get on the frontlines and with the protesters. There‚Äôs always demonstrations going on he could be part of. 

Reach out to black Leftubers and leftist content creators and learn from them. Raise them up by shouting them out. Donate to charities and learn to use his voice for others and not for himself.

He has enough money to start a damn charity of his own. If he‚Äôs so creative like he says then he should use that to help others instead of him."
5906,2020-06-28 12:13:36,hh8xbg,He already apologised and they didn‚Äôt accept it. Publicly or privately apologising to them means nothing. Constantly saying sorry is demanding for a pass for the victim to forget the wrong that you did to them so you can feel better about yourself. It would show that he truly does not care about the pain he has caused and is only saying sorry to give his ego some form of relief from the uncomfortable feelings he‚Äôs been forced to feel.

5909,2020-06-28 16:29:56,hh8xbg,I think it's perfectly possible for David Dobrik to be a racist and Shane to also have racist and problematic content. It isn't either or.
5910,2020-06-28 16:31:03,hh8xbg,To be fair Seth (the black guy in the videos) recently was trying to expose David on Instagram and was asking for an apology.
5911,2020-06-28 16:35:35,hh8xbg,"Trisha is going through her own separate drama right now. She made a video to Gabbie Hanna and briefly mentioned the vlog squad. Now she‚Äôs coming for them from what I‚Äôve gathered. Apparently one of them was dating an underage girl as well. I never watched them to begin with but I hate Gabbie Hanna and have been trying to keep track of that so that‚Äôs all I really know.

As a whole I think a lot of creators, and YT as a whole, need to take accountability for the trash they‚Äôve put out and labeled as comedy."
5912,2020-06-28 16:47:32,hh8xbg,"It's hard because the internet has a 2 second attention span but all these people probably need to lose their platforms - Trish, the vlogsquad, Shane, Jeffree. It doesn't have to be a situation where we support one or the other when they all suck."
5913,2020-06-28 16:48:09,hh8xbg,"Deflection, distraction, and diffusion. While it's true that what's going on over on the vlog squad is awful, she's doing it \*now\* to protect J\*, in my opinion. Right now everyone is laser-focused on Shane and distracted by David D, and J\* is attempting to fly under the radar."

5953,2020-06-30 03:43:53,hh8xbg,Her videos are so entertaining! I also recall her saying that Tati would be releasing a video but that it would take longer than people want because she's making sure she's in the clear legally. That prediction is the only reason I still have hope for Ms. Tati. ü§£ü§°
5954,2020-06-28 18:58:22,hh8xbg,I feel like everything was about JC and what most people are going to run with.
5955,2020-06-28 18:51:24,hh8xbg,Did you watch the end of the video? She mentions Shane and what was coming out about him as she was filming. But J* shouldn't be forgotten.
5956,2020-06-28 17:34:20,hh8xbg,Ya until I hear the victim or solid proof I‚Äôm not jumping on the bandwagon. I think it‚Äôs weird that the alleged victim which everyone thinks is Grayson would be okay with jeffree going on bragging about the tape and apparently reaching out to James (his words) last time. I‚Äôll definitely be open though if allegations do come forward with proof and not just jeffree fucking with us.
5957,2020-06-28 17:28:42,hh8xbg,"Y'all have been up in these megathreads wondering how J\* keeps getting  away with his shit, and this is exactly how! Every time he's about to be  called out and dragged, his squad muddies the waters with distracting  drama from somewhere else. It's textbook deflection."
5958,2020-06-28 17:29:29,hh8xbg,"I don‚Äôt think this will happen.  People are skeptical about the new claims due to the lack of receipts.  Have a look at the recent comments here.  

There are ways to prove your allocations without revealing the victim and she failed to do so.  Weak tea at best"
5959,2020-06-28 17:26:00,hh8xbg,Right? For a video supposedly calling out Jeffree star there wasn‚Äôt a lot of damaging things against Jeffree star. ü§îü§îü§î

5962,2020-06-28 17:26:54,hh8xbg,The thing is that this time according to Blaire there is a legitimate receipt that shows questionable behavior.
5963,2020-06-29 09:28:19,hh8xbg,"The thing i keep going back to is who even has that subject ready as a joke, let alone THAT often? Like as a go-to for a laugh? It's legitimately unsettling."

5969,2020-06-28 06:58:03,hh8xbg,"Thats not in J* character at all, its too obvious and would make him visible again"
5970,2020-06-28 08:25:06,hh8xbg,"I don't understand why he would. They're in this together and he's getting off Scott free by having the spotlight on Shane. Shane hasn't said anything bad about Jeffree. If Jeffree were to say anything it would be in defence of Shane I reckon. But that would only throw fuel on the Shane dumpster fire by reminding people they're still associated, and would bring JS back into the spotlight. Silence is literally the only logical and smart thing to do here. They probably spoke about this and anyone marginally sensible would just be quiet."

6021,2020-06-28 08:36:43,hh8xbg,There‚Äôs twitch but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd survive
6022,2020-06-28 08:30:37,hh8xbg,"He could probably pick up work as a radio DJ, a host on some mediocre tv show, or editing (discretely) for another YouTuber"

6027,2020-06-28 08:49:34,hh8xbg,Lol WOW.
6028,2020-06-28 15:38:27,hh8xbg,Some people never heard of Shane Dawson until his series with Jeffree
6029,2020-06-28 15:57:52,hh8xbg,"I never knew about the extent of his ""jokes"" until now. I vaguely knew he apologised for past inappropriate jokes and genuinely thought the jokes were mildly offensive and that since he apologised people should give him a break - without digging deeper to actually watch the old videos etc. Most people are casual viewers and don't really know everyone's history through and through - that was my case at least."
6030,2020-06-28 15:44:23,hh8xbg,Honestly a ton of people who subscribed to him within the last couple years (watching conspiracy vids) had NO IDEA these kind of clips existed. I‚Äôm horrified I financially contributed to him. Anyone want a pig backpack?
6031,2020-06-28 16:21:18,hh8xbg,"These podcasts keep getting referenced and all I keep wondering is where the full podcasts are- like, are they still up, unedited, where he claims that he is joking in between the other statements he made - you know, where he‚Äôs claiming that the internet is editing out his words to make it seem way worse than it is? That‚Äôs what I want to see/hear.

With him deleting so much off his YouTube, I‚Äôm afraid to even go look for the podcasts because my gut tells me I‚Äôm going come up empty handed... then it becomes his/his fans word against the internet. Sigh."
6032,2020-06-28 15:49:06,hh8xbg,"Totally agree. None of this is fresh tea. Y‚Äôall just looking for someone to hate, and the mob has decided Shane is the next in line for the ritual takedown, for things that they‚Äôve already known for YEARS. All of this was public content all this time ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
6033,2020-06-28 18:46:26,hh8xbg,"My girlfriend and I were actually speculating that this is what J* wanted all along. Even though Blaire might have intended to expose Jeffree, in turn, she accidentally put the spotlight back onto James and got the heat off of J*. Again we were just theorizing but knowing how manipulative he is, wouldn‚Äôt put it past him."
6034,2020-06-28 18:41:35,hh8xbg,It's like a tennis match between James and Shane and Jeff is just sitting in the stands STILL unscathed. And it's not even drama at this point. It's sickening that sexual abuse is the tennis ball here.
6035,2020-06-28 19:07:35,hh8xbg,"Im not worried about keeping the pressure on shane. He‚Äôs cooked. If that‚Äôs what blaire was attempting, she‚Äôs a little too late."

6046,2020-06-29 02:49:21,hh8xbg,"The stuff Jaclyn says about Eugenia, I really feel. Shane ruined any chance she had at a recovery. He thrust her into the spotlight, FRESH out of rehab, and then he just left her to fend for herself... that mixed with every other shit thing he's done over the last 10 years is so saddening to me. Shane is SO scummy."
6047,2020-06-29 02:53:10,hh8xbg,"I think this should be what initiates the next mega thread. We waited for today to be the day of Blaire‚Äôs videos, but actually it was Jaclyn‚Äôs that actually brought some worthwhile info"
6048,2020-06-29 02:46:59,hh8xbg,Love Jaclyn! Been watching her for several years. I'm glad she touched on Eugenia.
6049,2020-06-29 08:13:46,hh8xbg,Of course we haven‚Äôt watched Jackyn‚Äôs Video. It‚Äôs not 2017 üòî /s
6050,2020-06-29 09:56:15,hh8xbg,"I don't think Jaclyn Glenn was wrong in her criticism of how Shane mishandled the Eugenia Clooney documentary... but I'm also not very comfortable directing people to her channel to watch her videos since she also seemed to use Eugenia for views. In general she's pretty vile, she supports Blaire White no matter what she does and supported Onision way after people were already aware of how disgusting he is."
6051,2020-06-29 08:12:07,hh8xbg,Jacklyn hill? What video did she post?

6057,2020-06-29 23:12:41,hh8xbg,"Yeah, there‚Äôs someone who said they‚Äôre friends with her. I asked them why, and they said that they realized she‚Äôs ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù but that she helped them through a lot personally. Or something along those lines."

6064,2020-06-30 02:11:11,hh8xbg,"You‚Äôre right I just refreshed his IG and it went from 4375 to 4373 photos. Also who has 4,000 Instagram posts??? WTH

Edit it‚Äôs already down to 4367."
6065,2020-06-28 19:43:32,hh8xbg,"Do you watch every single video of every youtuber that you follow, even the stuff from years ago? Because I don't. I have openly admitted here and on other threads that I am not proud of having supported either of them in the past and while this information may have been public, it doesn't mean that everyone consumed it or was aware of it. I believe in accountability too, but to expect every single viewer to be aware of every single problem/video/thing that someone has done is unrealistic."
6066,2020-06-28 19:42:19,hh8xbg,"Period. 

The only exception is those who stanned/stun? him in the beginning of his career when they were young, ie 10-13. They were the first generation to be raised in youtube and many didnt know what shane was doing was wrong. Provided, of course, they don‚Äôt stan him now, i think it‚Äôs understandable"
6067,2020-06-28 20:00:55,hh8xbg,"I do find it frustrating that people are acting like the knowledge many of us now have about these kinds of issues was common 10, 15, 20 years ago.  Jokes about trans people, different races, etc, were extremely common on television not that long ago. The reason it was so common was that ordinary people didn‚Äôt have a voice and most people lived in their bubble and didn‚Äôt realize how these things affected others.  Off the top of my head I can think of inappropriate jokes about trans people in Friends and Sex and the City. 

Are these things okay?  Of course not. But not that long ago they weren‚Äôt viewed that way. It‚Äôs amazing that we‚Äôre recognizing the hurt that has been caused, but people made these kinds of jokes because other people liked them. 

Not in any way excusing anyone for their past or current behaviors, but I‚Äôm sure creators were getting plenty of likes for the things we now realize are wrong."

6071,2020-06-28 15:45:26,hh8xbg,"Exactly. Like ten years ago I was 9. In all my 19 years, I think the worst thing I've done is maybe steal something from Walmart. It truly isn't hard to not behave this way."

6074,2020-06-28 09:28:39,hh8xbg,I had seen the pedo jokes from his podcast exposed around the same time that the podcast clip about him being sexual with his cat was a major discussion. At that time I did not know the video clips with his cousin existed or the Willow Smith poster clip existed. He blew the cat clip off as a joke and just another scandal over nothing but never addressed all the other disturbing clips from the podcast. He claimed the cat joke was taken out of context and now is still saying that the pedo jokes were also edited out of context but there‚Äôs really no context that would make any of his words seem like jokes.
6075,2020-06-28 09:19:07,hh8xbg,Nah it was.  He‚Äôs made an apology video before (maybe 2017 or 18?) regarding the ‚Äòsexy‚Äô comments on the 6yr old girl (i feel gross from typing this)
6076,2020-06-28 09:23:10,hh8xbg,"There was a pretty big feud about it some time ago actually. Also, they're not just jokes, here's him saying that pedophilia is just like any other fetish and should not be criminalized, that he's searched for ch*ld p.. and talking about a ""sexy"" 5 year old in all seriousness: https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1233427880328116&id=100009827467610"
6077,2020-06-28 20:20:07,hh8xbg,"There's no proof so what is he supposed to counter with, exactly? He'd be better off to just ignore it unless something more substantial comes out."
6078,2020-06-28 20:18:46,hh8xbg,"I'd agree if there was something new to respond to. He already addressed all of this, it's just being recycled because Shane and Jeff are getting heat."

However, J* is far from her family friendly type of image. So the f why does she support him publicly?! I swear these white yters be acting all Jesussy but when it comes to having real compassion for other human beings, aka not stanning a racist misogynistic velociraptor, it‚Äôs like they lost their sight, hearing and common sense. You could not convince them that what they‚Äôre doing is bad, because they have been hardwired to believe the world revolves around THEM and THEIR needs. Disgusting double standard and hypocrisy. And when you dare point that very obvious fact you‚Äôre suddenly the bully who doesn‚Äôt want to live in peace, and is bringing negativity and bla-bla-bla my white world is nice come dance with me .

I'm also interested in why Garrett Watts hasn't been around in a while. It's like when they did a few videos with Circle Jerk Star he disappeared off Shane's channel. I wonder if Garrett wasn't happy with the friendship. You can only hide your true self for so long and J\*, while being good at hiding who he is, couldn't keep his racist shit to himself for so long. I honestly think Shane cleaned up his act back when he met Garrett in 2016. I think in those two years, Shane's content went pretty mainstream and wasn't so ""shocking"" but was rather the friends hanging out and doing their conspiracy videos. 

I think Garrett met Shane on a dating app, didn't want or didn't bother to watch his old videos, and are just as shocked as everyone else they're coming out. Let's be honest, Shane had his finger in a lot of ""pots."" I think he minimalized the channels where he was acting like an idiot and explained he'd apologized for things in his past. I think Garrett was willing to forgive him, but when Shane met J\* all of that changed and Shane went back to his old ways.

Exit Garrett. Or at least that's my conspiracy theory.

I'd also like to see what Andrew is saying about all this. His last tweet was June 15 and his Instagram was on Blackout Tuesday. Before he'd always defended Shane but now there's radio silence. I'd be interested in what he has to say."
6118,2020-06-29 21:01:23,hh8xbg,"He attacks anyone that criticizes him, I doubt anyone close to him would want to tell him something he doesn‚Äôt want to hear and then have to deal with his emotional tantrum after."
6119,2020-06-29 20:57:44,hh8xbg,"Probably not ... He was making bank. A whole cottage industry emerges around people when they start making huge money - alot of people depended on keeping him churning out content. And let's face it , his audience was lapping that content up. So why would anyone depending on him confront it when it would have meant stopping the train , and redirecting with no guarantee of the same yield ? Let's not paint his associates as victims of his . For one of his videos to be uploaded, a lot of people have to sign off, every step of the way . His team and his circle are complicit in the production of his content ."

Absolutely this. The real loser in this entire fucking situation is the person who allegedly left that voice memo. It is so incredibly fucked up that J* potentially shared that shit as ""tea"". 

It's not fucking tea, Jeffree. It's someone's worst experience and you're sharing as fucking entertainment. 

I don't want to hear any voice memo. If one exists and the person who left it wants to give info, then so be it. But I absolutely don't want to hear a victim leaving a message they likely thought would be kept private that has now become drama fodder."

6134,2020-06-28 10:37:14,hh8xbg,"I think it‚Äôs because they all share that same crude sense of ‚Äúhumor‚Äù (or rather a lack of). His brother has made similar jokes, his mom encouraged a girl to twerk while on Omegle, his cousins played terrible characters in skits, etc. I genuinely think they didn‚Äôt see it as anything other than ‚Äúdark humor‚Äù. I can‚Äôt imagine NOT seeing something wrong with his old content though, especially being family. Like, did they live in a bubble? Did they not realize those ‚Äújokes‚Äù and ‚Äúskits‚Äù were more than just offensive, but harmful?"
6135,2020-06-28 10:45:09,hh8xbg,His mum said the n word to so I‚Äôm not shocked she didn‚Äôt stop him.
6136,2020-06-28 10:48:22,hh8xbg,"Uh his own Aunt excused it away and said she thought it was funny and ‚Äòthat‚Äôs just how our family is Shane.‚Äô He said he tried to apologize to her for sexualizing her 12 year old kid, and she excused it away! It‚Äôs a sick demented family! His perversion started somewhere right?"
6137,2020-06-28 10:38:39,hh8xbg,She was actually filmed with him while he asked a young girl to twerk for them. I was sickened that a mom would think it was okay to do that and film it!
6138,2020-06-28 10:32:50,hh8xbg,"No one has come out and defended him, meaning they know how fucked up shane is/was"
6139,2020-06-28 11:09:12,hh8xbg,His female Jewish friend was not happy about his anti-semitic drawings of her and he kept going with the jokes while she was nervously laughing. The clip might have been on either Sanders' or Truth Sleuth's channel.
6140,2020-06-28 13:24:25,hh8xbg,His brother Jared was in a lot of his old skits playing racist caricatures along with him.

then basically twitter has turned on SD and A LOT of his old skits videos, social media posts are being exposed

reddit is mad and frustrated that JS is avoiding the fallout

Blair White made a bunch of attention grabbing cryptic posts about a video then the video was nothing but speculation and bs that really only tried to distract and drag up old probably untrue shit. Seriously just skip it"

6168,2020-06-28 18:53:12,hh8xbg,Can they just drop him already
6169,2020-06-28 18:59:01,hh8xbg,Just checked and I don‚Äôt see that

6180,2020-06-29 02:02:43,hh8xbg,How do you know she didn't? Are you privy to their private conversations? We can't know one way or the other.
6181,2020-06-29 02:01:40,hh8xbg,Blaire white shouldn‚Äôt be trusted at all. See my previous comment in this post if you want to know more about her.
6182,2020-06-28 18:53:32,hh8xbg,"Exactly how I feel. Everyone should be held accountable for things they‚Äôve done, but stop fucking teasing receipts and going on about how they‚Äôre credible WHEN THEY ARE NOT PUBLIC."
6183,2020-06-28 18:58:41,hh8xbg,Blame Jeffree for that. He‚Äôs the one with all the secrets he‚Äôs lording over people‚Äôs heads.

6185,2020-06-28 18:53:03,hh8xbg,And all the speculation is doing nothing but harm to the possible victim. I'm sure the *last* thing they want is the whole internet talking about it.
6186,2020-06-29 21:36:54,hh8xbg,"I agree with you about no new information but not about Jingle Fish winning. If things went how he intended, focus would be off him and Shane right now and JC would be getting cancelled all over again."
6187,2020-06-29 21:41:40,hh8xbg,"Jafar has not won. He‚Äôs not posting and staying silent. We have him by the balls. His merch line supports a pedo, like c‚Äômon? Haha! He‚Äôll post a sad video like when he broke up with Nate in a week.. üôÑü•±"
6188,2020-06-28 05:37:01,hh8xbg,I thought so up until Jaden tweeted. Actual mainstream attention really makes it hard to guage what happens next
6189,2020-06-28 05:44:08,hh8xbg,"nope. Jerry Stonk may recover, because he is a cockroach, but Shane? After faux jerking off in front of a DISNEY branded Williow Smith poster? I don't think so."
6190,2020-06-28 05:52:29,hh8xbg,The Smiths calling Shane out is like some head of the five families business... okay not that serious but if that big of a celebrity family calls you on your shit I don't see recovery. Especially since Shane is just a personality there isn't anything he can really fall back on.
6191,2020-06-28 05:52:14,hh8xbg,"the stuff about willow Smith and the other incredibly disgusting things he said about a baby, not going to repeat it here,and all the other vile things he's said about children plus those other videos clips we've seen.  I know it's overwhelming but----it's children,the public won't put up with that. he should get some  help and stop surrounding sycophants. i imagine if the money goes away,so will his circle."
6192,2020-06-28 05:58:04,hh8xbg,I highly doubt he will. He already cultivated this image of being a wholesome unproblematic youtube poster child unlike jeffree who is known to be petty and dramatic. Drama for shane is going to hurt his image a lot more than it will for jeffree.
6193,2020-06-28 05:39:38,hh8xbg,"i‚Äôm with you, but like the other commenter said, this is kind of unprecedented with how mainstream it is now. he is definitely not going to get sponsors though. i wonder if ryland will lose his sponsors too"
6194,2020-06-28 06:18:11,hh8xbg,"I think had the smiths not come into it, then yes, but now..."
6195,2020-06-28 05:39:53,hh8xbg,I am a pessimistic asshole.  Shane will recover.  Jeffree will be more powerful.  Sadly.
6196,2020-06-28 06:29:48,hh8xbg,"He will, because most people forget and move on to the next scandal.  Give it a few months or even a year, he‚Äôll put out a well produced emotional and seemingly sincere video and enough people will buy it. I know we all want this to be forever, but odds are it won‚Äôt be. The only YouTuber that was really cancelled for good that I can think of is Onision who literally (allegedly) engaged in pedophilIa, abuse, countless meltdowns and attacking his audience. Call me cynical, but I don‚Äôt think this will stick in the long run.

To be clear, I want it to stick and I‚Äôm not rooting for him."
6197,2020-06-28 14:59:23,hh8xbg,"I still don‚Äôt think she‚Äôll do it, tbh."
6198,2020-06-28 14:53:28,hh8xbg,She will
6199,2020-06-28 15:06:36,hh8xbg,I thought the original intention of the video was to defend Shane by bringing up J*
6200,2020-06-28 14:56:33,hh8xbg,Pfffffft
6201,2020-06-28 14:55:35,hh8xbg,Well she‚Äôs even more racist than he is so she probably will.
6202,2020-06-28 14:55:58,hh8xbg,Im so scared for whoever might be getting hurt in the proces.  She was conflicted on wether to release this because j* brought her in this awful position... and she said on her instagram she was so emotional from filming this.....
6203,2020-06-28 14:54:59,hh8xbg,"That was the point of her video, right?"
6204,2020-06-28 15:49:59,hh8xbg,oh you KNOW she will just like how she talked about J* calling Dahvie a predator completely ignoring how J* took that comment back and claimed to not know that despite taking the clip she used in the video from a video that mentioned J* taking the comment back in like the first 30 seconds
6205,2020-06-29 12:40:44,hh8xbg,"Have any drama channels actually confirmed they‚Äôve heard the memo? I know ashlye, Dustin, Peter Monn, Kennedy sanders, and possibly a couple others have all said they never received it or heard it. J* just told them that he had a voice memo of a testimony.

ETA: also forgot that petty Paige said she hasn‚Äôt heard it. Just heard that other tea channels had (but didn‚Äôt list specific names)"
6206,2020-06-29 13:35:29,hh8xbg,"The thing is Tati was never involved in drama until this point. I definitely think J* let her and apparently everyone else, listen to that voice message and Tati thought the allegations were true. If that‚Äôs what happened, then Blair was right and everyone else who knew was complicit in this knowledge of JC molestation and Tati was the only one choosing to speak out. He used Tati to do his work for him and now is trying to do the same thing with Blair.

Lots of people bring up that Tati was mad about vitamins, but I just don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs it. If the allegations were proven to be true, everyone would be praising her for speaking out, but instead she‚Äôs a backstabbing liar. I  just think she did what she thought was right at the time. Blair did the same thing while damning J* in the process."
6207,2020-06-29 14:45:35,hh8xbg,Honestly all my support to the victim. Can you imagine the trauma they must be going through if they go on the internet right now? And last year as well.
6208,2020-06-29 16:55:09,hh8xbg,I remember Tati said she had receipts stacked high....what a horrible thing to do to a victim. Use their trauma for receipts
6209,2020-06-28 10:36:14,hh8xbg,"I'm just about Shane's age. This ""humor"" wasn't ok back then. There was less accountability on the internet and people got away with a lot more, but saying it ""just how things were"" or something is a complete fabrication and excuse for bad behavior."
6210,2020-06-28 10:56:59,hh8xbg,None of these jokes were funny when he made them. They were tone deaf and gross when he made them. Sad that it has taken so long for him to catch heat for them.
6211,2020-06-28 11:38:48,hh8xbg,"I‚Äôm 32, so I guess I‚Äôm around their age? I was in college from 2006-2010. So in that time MySpace was big (starting to die down tho bc FB came out) and YouTube starting up. 
I have to say I hate the defense of ‚Äúit was different times‚Äù because even back then we all knew it was wrong to do black face. We knew making jokes about race and sexuality were bad. It was never funny or ‚Äúedgy‚Äù.  People just didn‚Äôt get ‚Äúcancelled‚Äù for it like they do now."
6212,2020-06-28 11:07:44,hh8xbg,"Same. Although not a lot of people will admit it I do remember tons and tons of people IRL that ignorantly, immaturely, and unfortunately made tons of racist jokes when they were young teens. CSA, however was NEVER a laughable topic. Never. Under no circumstances. And I knew some incredibly vile people."
6213,2020-06-28 10:41:44,hh8xbg,"I think I was about 12 when I first heard about him, and all that stuff is exactly why I never watched him because it felt wrong and uncomfortable. I still knew at 12yo it wasn't okay so his excuse ""iT wAs A jOkE"" is complete bullshit."
6214,2020-06-28 11:18:04,hh8xbg,Yes exactly ! I was a teenager back then and was always on MySpace etc. The worst I saw it amongst my friends and online was people always said things like ‚Äúomg gay‚Äù or slut shaming. Those things were not seen as offensive back then as much. But never did I see saying racial slurs or pedophilic stuff (except I remember pedo bear). This stuff was definitely not ok back then either
6215,2020-06-28 11:25:34,hh8xbg,"Like they say it was different times but if you were a decent person even back then, it wasn't, they've just been clout chasers since the very beginning and clearly done everything in their power to chase it. Unfortunate"
6216,2020-06-28 10:58:00,hh8xbg,"Agreed! I never watched him back in the day, but I always saw his videos popping up and knew he was popular. I am so shocked that he did all of this stuff and still went on to have a massive platform."
6217,2020-06-28 11:33:15,hh8xbg,"I don‚Äôt think Onision was ‚Äúright‚Äù as in he knew Shane‚Äôs jokes were fucked up, because Onision made similar jokes before. Onision often called Shane a predator to deflect, and try and defame."
6218,2020-06-28 12:05:44,hh8xbg,"We do not mention Onision. Let him die in irrelevancy, please."
6219,2020-06-28 11:48:42,hh8xbg,I‚Äôm only very peripherally aware of Onision. What and when did he comment on Shane?
6220,2020-06-28 17:36:47,hh8xbg,This sound so ridiculous. He is beauty guru not a murderer
6221,2020-06-28 17:30:01,hh8xbg,If anything it makes me scared for her. Idk if I‚Äôm being over dramatic but I feel like J* would hire a hit man on someone if he really felt like it
6222,2020-06-28 18:40:59,hh8xbg,I found this very confusing. Also she said there no evidence of it just Jeffree‚Äôs word but that it. Was ‚Äúcredible‚Äù... like how is it credible? Her whole video is about what a monster Jeffree is
6223,2020-06-28 18:48:49,hh8xbg,Potentially because JC‚Äôs name is the only one we know so far in these allegations? I could be wrong.
6224,2020-06-28 19:14:19,hh8xbg,Same
6225,2020-06-28 19:07:37,hh8xbg,It would be stupid to respond to an unfounded claim by Blaire when he already addressed the situation and he isn‚Äôt getting attention (at least not yet)
6226,2020-06-28 19:16:03,hh8xbg,"i dont think he will or that he even should. he already defended himself last year and there's really no actual proof of the claims that are being thrown around. aside from that, were he to involve himself in this mess, it would divert the attention from j\* and shane and we really don't want that."
6227,2020-06-28 19:01:41,hh8xbg,Ughhhh Blaire is trending now on Twitter.
6228,2020-06-28 19:08:12,hh8xbg,He has already addressed these allegations- a YEAR AGO. Why are y'all so easily manipulated by Jeffree?! The man is a pathological liar at this point and was throwing false accusations around last year as well and writing the most heinous messages to James and his brother. James was cleared of the accusation then; what has changed to make you think he's suddenly not?? Because now it's Blaire and not Jeffree saying it? Even though she has been fed information FROM JEFFREE? üëçhave you been ironing your brain because it's looking smooth af
6229,2020-06-28 19:02:13,hh8xbg,"Same, this will only reopen the wounds he has tried to heal"
6230,2020-06-29 20:26:56,hh8xbg,"I just got an email today from Beautylish all things Jeffree Star Cosmetic (no sale, just pushing the products)."
6231,2020-06-29 19:53:44,hh8xbg,"Well, I‚Äôve see. An ad from a big swiss cosmetics retailer advertising JSC with 50% off‚ò†Ô∏è coincide? I dont think. They ain‚Äôt playing"

6233,2020-06-29 20:22:42,hh8xbg,"If he's truly an investor/owner or whatever, can they drop him?"
6234,2020-06-29 20:45:58,hh8xbg,"I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs related or if Black Swallow scored an exclusive deal over the other Australian retailers so pure speculation but only 1 of the 3 (or 4) Australian retailers had the Conspiracy and Cremated launch last weekend. 
The second major retailer for us Princess Polly have drastically decreased their line of JSC. 
Not sure if there‚Äôs something else there or not but interesting timing to say the least."
6235,2020-06-29 20:21:57,hh8xbg,Agreed.
6236,2020-06-29 20:23:04,hh8xbg,Fr but at least these mega threads are proof we need that subreddit chat thingy
6237,2020-06-29 19:58:19,hh8xbg,Dangelo is dropping a video later today
6238,2020-06-29 20:55:59,hh8xbg,"Eh, I'm kinda happy to have a day off from this. The constant heaviness with new stuff going up and people still supporting them is driving me crazy."
6239,2020-06-28 20:31:30,hh8xbg,"The devil works hard, but Jeffree Star...might actually be the literal devil, you guys"
6240,2020-06-28 20:02:56,hh8xbg,"If Jeffree is so powerful and blocked her for making a video about Dahvie, then why was she allowed to release this one so easily? Make it make sense"
6241,2020-06-28 20:03:55,hh8xbg,Also she mentions at the end of the video something like ‚Äúyou never know who jeffree‚Äôs paid off‚Äù
6242,2020-06-28 20:02:56,hh8xbg,"Yes, yes, and yes ‚Äî she belongs in a fucking dumpster regardless."
6243,2020-06-28 19:10:39,hh8xbg,[removed]
6244,2020-06-28 19:10:35,hh8xbg,Exactly. It‚Äôs once again a situation with no actual proof. I‚Äôll take it serious when the voice memo goes public or someone comes forward. Blair made JC look worse than JS and refused to actually address Shane‚Äôs bullshit. I'm starting to think Blair came out with this video as bait to convince people she's going after JS when it's really about JC.
6245,2020-06-28 19:09:05,hh8xbg,Fair point. But Blaire White is actually trans herself
6246,2020-06-28 17:30:50,hh8xbg,"This whole thing stinks.. why is JS willing to share receipts of serious allegations to anyone?? He is trying to distract from his own drama and get JS canceled. He has manipulated Blair into doing his dirty work.

Edit: removed name of potential victim"
6247,2020-06-28 17:44:35,hh8xbg,honestly to me this adds more heat to JC than Jafar
6248,2020-06-29 13:56:10,hh8xbg,"I love Luchuchus. I used to love his videos with Rich Lux, before he became Jafar‚Äôs minion"
6249,2020-06-29 12:06:00,hh8xbg,The ending when he was back in drag was so spot on
6250,2020-06-29 13:13:40,hh8xbg,Do you know who the woman in that audio of a Shane podcast is? Cause she says right there ‚ÄòShane has this justification for ped@philia that‚Äôs really sick.‚Äô And something like ‚Äòyou‚Äôre gonna go to jail for those things.‚Äô I mean MY GOD! Talk about enabling a sicko! She said all that and then did nothing and laughed it off like it‚Äôs cute and funny. Who is that idiot?
6251,2020-06-30 00:45:17,hh8xbg,"i saw it, but i hadn't watched it yet. i read her apology on twitter last night but was kind of confused as to what she did"
6252,2020-06-30 01:26:12,hh8xbg,I can't find the apology but here's the racism and lots of it. https://youtu.be/MevxCXLDa54
6253,2020-06-28 18:49:54,hh8xbg,Blaire is getting involved in stuff that doesn‚Äôt concern her just like J* and cane out with a zero-receipt video that names JC as a rapist but then she also states there‚Äôs another rapist but that rapist gets to go unnamed. Blaire rightly should be ignored.
6254,2020-06-28 18:53:07,hh8xbg,"Also, it gets her points with her base - mad, cishet white men who want _one more reason_ to talk shit about LGBTQ+ folks. One flamboyantly gay man blackmailing another super-gay dude with a reputation of being predatory towards Precious, Blameless Straight Men! over a rape? This is a Blackout on the traditional gender roles, traditional marriage bingo card."
6255,2020-06-28 19:13:14,hh8xbg,"Tdlr of blaire‚Äôs video:

She starts of by saying that she was scared to release the video, but decided to go ahead as it was ‚Äúthe right thing to do‚Äù Claims to have been told things by J that made her feel complicit to his actions

Verifies that she has never met J, but facetimed him twice

She explains that when she was making a video on Dahvie Vanity, J called her and manipulated her into not releasing the vid. She agreed to not release it.

When she saw J on the Chris Hansen podcast ‚Äúclearing‚Äù his name, she realized he lied and dropped the video

On the facetime when J was manipulative, she claims that J told her that James Charles raped a well known youtuber and he provided a voice memo proving it. Blaire feels that it is not her place to release the memo, but urges the victim to speak up.

She claims J told her that another well known youtuber raped someone, but while J provided no evidence, she believes it is ‚Äúbelievable‚Äù

She finishes by saying she doesn‚Äôt condone shanes jokes, amd that she just discovered everything like the rest of us.

To conclude, she provided no receipts, but i think not releasing the voice memo is understandable if its true

She says that keemstar probs has heard the voice memo as J is alleged to have played it to him before an interview

Edit: words"
6256,2020-06-28 17:48:51,hh8xbg,"i just feel like i'd be stupid to fall for it twice, so no, not doing that this time."
6257,2020-06-29 16:52:46,hh8xbg,"Blaire White doing shitty things?!

next you're gonna tell me water is wet. 

(Legit tho, BW is garbage)"
6258,2020-06-29 16:53:10,hh8xbg,"If it makes you feel better, she's most likely lying."
6259,2020-06-29 16:53:13,hh8xbg,"!!!! AND SHE HERSELF IS A SURVIVOR, HOW DOES SHE NOT KNOW (read CARE) THAT THAT IS OVER THE LINE?! She is the CEO of only caring about herself and wanting other people to only care about her & throw everyone else to the wolves."
6260,2020-06-29 16:50:32,hh8xbg,This
6261,2020-06-28 22:27:13,hh8xbg,"I remember one of the accusers shared a FaceTime call and it was so damning at the time. 

Then James made his video and that same guy apologized for everything bc context wasn‚Äôt provided. I don‚Äôt believe any of it from what I‚Äôve observed."
6262,2020-06-28 22:25:07,hh8xbg,"I'm enraged by this whole thing, if there are real victims in this, they have had zero opportunity to tell their own story, and its been used as political currency by awful people across the board. I can't even imagine what they (if they exist) are going through right now"
6263,2020-06-28 23:52:35,hh8xbg,"So the memo being fake occurred to me too. Blair seemed to genuinely believe it was real but who knows? 

I also caught that Blair said she reached out to the victims to offer support, but didn‚Äôt say that she spoke to them or that they confirmed anything. 

I just hope that if this is real the victims are getting a lot of support, and if it‚Äôs not James is getting lots of support. It‚Äôs just such a mess, I feel awful either way. This whole thing is just awful."
6264,2020-06-29 00:11:11,hh8xbg,Money... she hyped it up loads and so loads of people will watch it
6265,2020-06-29 00:16:25,hh8xbg,She said it at the beginning. If she doesn't speak up she's complicit and if she does shes outing the victim. The video lets her viewers know she was made aware of the situation and jeffree has been pressuring her to keep quiet
6266,2020-06-29 01:40:12,hh8xbg,"Tbh it makes no sense to me when they say ""this is not a story for me to tell"" when they literally have said everything except the name.

What I have to credit her tho, is the ending when she mentions Shane. I had no idea Shane gave her (a white suprecists) a platform."
6267,2020-06-29 01:21:54,hh8xbg,"For me, I perceived it as shes upset that Shane was getting more heat then JS and wanted empathize how disgusting he is by saying how quick he was to share, manipulate her with that information.

Thats why i think she inserted that last part acknowledging how she seen Shanes recent stuff unfold with Willow and had to say how she felt about that because it would contradict what she was trying to do.

In the end I'm happy she shared her feelings and wasn't a follower.

Thats what I wanted, people to speak out on the shit because saying nothing only keeps the ""bad"" ontop"
6268,2020-06-28 15:56:59,hh8xbg,Okay wow I need more insight on this. I know it‚Äôs a joke but I want more info from her
6269,2020-06-30 04:04:41,hh8xbg,"GASP!!!!! I bet it will be really well thought out and include new verifiable information and a sensible argument and not make anything worse          /s

lol it will prob be a drivethru mukbang or her on her kitchen floor right?"
6270,2020-06-30 04:17:33,hh8xbg,Who cares what that bag of trash has to say anymore? She's just as bad.
6271,2020-06-28 08:31:24,hh8xbg,I know he ended up either deleting or making every video private on his ShaneDawsonTV channel. There are no longer any videos on that channel. That channel had all of his offensive videos with offensive skits and characters on it. A lot of the clips on Twitter exposing him for inappropriate or racist behavior came from that channel. In his apology (which I didn‚Äôt watch so I‚Äôm not 100% sure) he didn‚Äôt show any actual clips of his past behavior so I‚Äôm thinking he‚Äôs trying to hide any evidence that has been exposed on Twitter and anything that could potentially expose his behavior further. Fans of his play down his past because he himself downplayed the behavior in his apology and didn‚Äôt show any clips. I believe he did the same thing in his apology video from a few years ago...he said he did things that offended some people but didn‚Äôt offend his audience. He didn‚Äôt show any clips and left the videos up on his ShaneDawsonTV channel. He even kept selling merch up until recently with an offensive character on it. His apology obviously wasn‚Äôt heartfelt back then if he left the videos and merch available for him to profit off of. If there are people that started watching Shane recently and haven‚Äôt actually seen his TV channel videos or skits or podcast clips they obviously are going to forgive him and say he‚Äôs changed because they don‚Äôt know how recent some of these things were or understand the severity.
6272,2020-06-28 08:17:13,hh8xbg,"Yeah it was pretty much the whole Shane Dawson channel and anything before his first ""apology"" video 5 years ago about blackface. You could have more information on r/shanedawson if you want :)"
6273,2020-06-28 08:11:56,hh8xbg,the oldest video is him apologising first blackface 5 years ago so i‚Äôm guessing there‚Äôs atleast 5+ years of videos deleted
6274,2020-06-28 08:13:01,hh8xbg,Wasn‚Äôt it the entire Shane Dawson TV channel he made private ? Not 100% sure so don‚Äôt take my word for it
6275,2020-06-28 08:15:20,hh8xbg,He took down every video on his old channel yesterday
6276,2020-06-28 08:45:48,hh8xbg,"Shane‚Äôs 2010-2015ish persona was filled with dark and edgelord humour, and unfunny comedic skits.  Majority of them were filled with racism, shock factor, saying/doing pr*datory things towards children (some were his relatives), and in general laughing at others expense"
6277,2020-06-28 12:29:24,hh8xbg,"Here‚Äôs what I know (sorry for bad links, mobile user):


He called a 6 year old sexy in a podcast and, in that same podcast, admitted to looking up child pornography. He also tried to defend pedophilia by comparing it to fetishes. (https://twitter.com/misshemlock/status/1276466199572832256?s=20)


He also posted a video pretending to masturbate to Willow Smith, who was 11 at the time of posting. (https://youtu.be/svqVIqW6-sg)


He and his mom also asked an underage girl to twerk on Omegle. 


He also participated in the writing of a web series with a puppet who was meant to be 8 years old, which included a LOT of sexual content. (https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyGuruChatter/comments/hh8xbg/shane_dawson_and_jeffree_star_megathread_7/fw94hti/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)


He also had a conversation with his 12 year old cousin that involved depictions of sex. She seemed uncomfortable. (https://twitter.com/woacbofficial/status/1276898421631324163?s=20)


Click this thread for a LOT more links and information. It‚Äôs truly sickening that he‚Äôs gotten away with this for so long. (https://twitter.com/woacbofficial/status/1276896992350867456?s=20)"
6278,2020-06-29 07:08:07,hh8xbg,"Tati never called him a predator. She said he ""tried to trick a straight man into thinking he's gay again"" in order to get them ""behave sexually in his favor."" Only J* called James a predator and accused him of assault, claiming to have that voice memo as proof. I actually rewatched bye sister and people are always putting the predator accusation in Tati's mouth, but she actually made claims about him manipulating straight boys' sexuality rather than assaulting anyone. I think because she uses such vague language, when J* wrote those tweets people automatically put it together as ""ohhh that's what she meant."""
6279,2020-06-29 20:45:33,hh8xbg,Just that target dropped Shane. He also said he reached out to morphe but doubts morphe will respond.
6280,2020-06-28 17:48:34,hh8xbg,"My thoughts exactly. How were all those people okay with listening to the memo and teasing it's existence, but not going to the police? Assault isn't ""tea/drama""."
6281,2020-06-28 23:39:36,hh8xbg,It‚Äôs horrible. I hate how he immediately makes an excuse too
6282,2020-06-28 18:45:13,hh8xbg,She is not credible at all and by the mere fact that she really didn't say anything new in this video she made it crystal clear that she is just trying to get that drama channel adsense.
6283,2020-06-28 18:55:16,hh8xbg,"As shitty as it is, in this world of fake news and the disregard for fact checking no one should be credible on face value on any claim!

How many times do we repost something without looking for it's origin?How many times do we look to see whether a news article is sponsered?How many times do we search for confirmation of what we've seen but do NOT search for the opposing view?Why do we look to influencers or famous ppl to give us the ""truth""?

Either people have unlearned that there is a distinction between opinion and fact or they DGAF.  Same for research vs googling.

Edit: in case it isn't clear I don't believe BW either"
6284,2020-06-28 18:55:10,hh8xbg,"I agree, we definitely shouldn't believe it just from this one video. However I do feel that more than anything Blaire's video is aimed at whoever the victim is and asking them to come out with it, rather than trying to provide receipts herself when it isn't her place. I think she is aware that her video isn't enough to prove anything."
6285,2020-06-29 01:13:28,hh8xbg,There's nothing new for James to respond to.
6286,2020-06-29 02:12:45,hh8xbg,Literally nothing is calm. People are livid all over the internet. You're just salivating for explosive videos.
6287,2020-06-29 10:27:27,hh8xbg,She made one! Her name is SarahJo Makeup. I have it queued up to watch this morning.
6288,2020-06-29 10:41:17,hh8xbg,she already did! sarahjo
6289,2020-06-29 13:54:26,hh8xbg,Isn't she also a jeffree fan?

6291,2020-06-28 06:56:52,hh8xbg,Whaa? What happened? I used to watch their game and music reactions once in a while but that was all so I don't know stuff that they did otherwise.
6292,2020-06-28 07:14:46,hh8xbg,Did you just read the twitter thread too?
6293,2020-06-28 17:22:33,hh8xbg,Yahoo comments are the worst. That and TMZ.
6294,2020-06-28 17:23:47,hh8xbg,What are they saying?
6295,2020-06-28 18:55:00,hh8xbg,"Very odd, I think his jsc page is sometimes run by other people but surely they'd be able to read the room right now and see it as a bad decision. Cant see them selling many now ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
6296,2020-06-28 18:53:27,hh8xbg,"Just saw that, that comment section is awfully positive, someone has to be culling negative feedback."

6298,2020-06-29 06:38:41,hh8xbg,Garrett's strategic likes are very telling.
6299,2020-06-29 06:27:27,hh8xbg,"Could be totally wrong but if it‚Äôs about Shane it might mean that Shane shouldn‚Äôt have to sit in front of a camera to convince people he‚Äôs ‚Äògood‚Äô , but rather show it through actions"
6300,2020-06-29 06:56:44,hh8xbg,Garrett is definitely aware of what is happening. He liked a tweet about Jada pinkett Smith very recently.
6301,2020-06-29 07:24:36,hh8xbg,Yep lots of people have been reading Shane's video for being wordy üëÄ
6302,2020-06-29 06:27:26,hh8xbg,Well well well!
6303,2020-06-28 21:53:17,hh8xbg,"There is no victim to believe or disbelieve yet. 


As far as we know it's all fabricated‚Äîjust like most of Jeffree's non-existing receipts. If there was a victim I highly doubt they'd let Jeffree be the voice of their story. 


Jeffree is the one that is actively hurting the alleged hypothesis victim by controlling the narrative of their abuse. It is not Jeffree's little piece of extortion material to wave around whenever it benefits him. Even he himself said on the podcast that he wasn't sure if it was real or not but then he actively invites the hosts to listen to it. And now he has played it for Blaire White? Like, way to disrespect a victim of SA."
6304,2020-06-28 21:58:19,hh8xbg,u/drinksoup brought up a good point that I forgot that was mentioned during Mom's Basement podcast - Jeffree himself stated that he doesn't even know if the voice memos are real or not. So how can Blair confirm this if Jeffree can't even himself?? Just seems like typical j* trying to throw twist narrative against James.
6305,2020-06-28 21:44:29,hh8xbg,"If a victim comes forward, we should give them support. But right now, I don't have any evidence to support the existence of a legitimate voice memo - much less a sexual assault."
6306,2020-06-28 21:46:39,hh8xbg,There is no victim so far. Just people \_claiming\_ they saw a \_recording\_ that \_could\_ be proof of something with a victim. I feel like believing it is very dangerous.
6307,2020-06-28 21:48:28,hh8xbg,I don't equate not believing them with not believing a victim. If a victim came forward I'd 100% believe them. This just feels like J* using an alleged victim as a pawn in his psycho games.
6308,2020-06-28 21:48:38,hh8xbg,Blaire White is not a victim. Blaire White is an opportunist who supports terrible people and terrible ideas using the current drama to her advantage. I have no reason to believe her.

I think Tati will come out with a video speaking her ‚Äútruth‚Äù and then James will hit every one of them with facts and recipts once again. James will defend his truth, he doesn‚Äôt have anything to hide. Jeffree has a damn skeleton in the closet and it‚Äôs being uncovered every second of this time."

6324,2020-06-28 18:44:53,hh8xbg,And constantly misgenders Riley to this day.
6325,2020-06-28 22:35:19,hh8xbg,She just uploaded a video and said that JS let her listen to another YouTuber who sent him a voice memo stating JC sexually assaulted him and ‚Äú*it sounded credible.*‚Äù then says another youtuber is a ra*ist but doesn‚Äôt name names and says ‚Äúthat‚Äôs their story to tell.‚Äù Like what? Did you just say you are a witness to 2 crimes but your overall video is about how JS manipulated you and you‚Äôre staying away from him? She‚Äôs all over the place. Drop those 2 massive bombs and bring JC back into this? What? Zero proof. How does a voice memo ‚Äúsound credible‚Äù? What is she doing??

6329,2020-06-28 18:32:40,hh8xbg,"Okay yes Blaire is a bad person agree on everything you said BUT several people have accused Riley Dennis of sexual assault - I remember those allegations from when she was popular on tumblr like 5 years ago and just a brief google search shows people have accused her on twitter in recent years. I believe survivors, and I don‚Äôt want to defend a sexual predator"
6330,2020-06-28 20:42:45,hh8xbg,She called him a psychopathic monster so she did say something about Jeffree just to be factual here.
6331,2020-06-28 20:48:13,hh8xbg,I agree but just wanted to note she is calling J* a ‚Äòdemon‚Äô on her snapchat and that she doesn‚Äôt know what to think of Shane anymore.
6332,2020-06-28 20:38:04,hh8xbg,she said plenty of bad things about J*???
6333,2020-06-28 20:39:17,hh8xbg,I'm completely convinced he doesn't care what names he's called but he wanted her to make that video

6337,2020-06-28 19:57:48,hh8xbg,"I‚Äôm confused as to how this helps J*. If the memo (or all the rumors) is fake, it‚Äôll be an easy defamation lawsuit for JC. If it‚Äôs true, J* will still look like garbage for spreading it around and using it to his benefit. With BWs video the focus is for sure shifting back from SD to J*, which is the silver lining I‚Äôm seeing rn in this mess."
6338,2020-06-28 19:55:08,hh8xbg,"While I agree this was likely unjustly done to James, that leaking theory isn‚Äôt necessarily true. If he didn‚Äôt SEND copies of it to anyone, just played it, they know about it but have no proof either. Most probably haven‚Äôt said anything or haven‚Äôt wanted to be involved with his shit. But if he told blaire, you better believe Shane, Ryland, Morgan, etc etc etc all heard it too probably. Sounds like he‚Äôs controlling who hears it and who doesn‚Äôt have it on their own phone so it DOESNT leak so he can keep using it as ‚Äútea‚Äù and security so James won‚Äôt lash out back at him again. Cause even the implication or association with this type of allegation is career ruining as we saw. 

Now I‚Äôm not even saying this memo does or does not exist, how do we know? I don‚Äôt know James but I doubt it‚Äôs true. But again, idk. I 100% think she has support for Shane in her heart but I also think there‚Äôs no harm in forcing J* to also come forward to answer for all his bullshit too. So even if she‚Äôs not a good source, I‚Äôm hoping it makes him say something. He deserves to be in the hot seat just as much if not more so than Shane."
6339,2020-06-28 09:35:26,hh8xbg,Yeah he made it pretty clear he still plans on making videos because he stated he wanted to add more diversity going forward. He may be losing subscribers but he still has apologist fans who will keep watching him. Also how many times has he previously made apology videos but continued to make new videos and continued to profit off of the exact old videos he apologized for? At what point will he be de-platformed and not allowed to continue the apology and move on like nothing happened cycle?

6348,2020-06-28 15:46:24,hh8xbg,That means we have to be responsible for hounding jeffree. We have to be on him all the time.
6349,2020-06-28 16:12:45,hh8xbg,"logan paul has only now begun to redeem himself because he's shown growth and I guess mike has a lot to do with that. The same goes for pewdiepie - man has said some shitty things but he has also apologised and worked at it. You can see a shift in his content and there has been some personal growth as well. 

I think if people take accountability, apologise and put in the work to grow - you can continue to support creators. 

Shane and jeffree exhibit a pattern of behaviour that doesn't show growth. It's evident because there are multiple instances of inappropriate behaviour even after they apologise. Will they be deplatformed infinitely? no. Shitty creators will continue to exist."
6350,2020-06-28 17:42:31,hh8xbg,"It may be, if the voice memo is leaked. Otherwise its just Blaire stirring the pot about rumors. And as it stands we can't prove or disprove if its true."
6351,2020-06-28 17:42:09,hh8xbg,Yes
6352,2020-06-28 19:09:08,hh8xbg,"> If the accusations against James are not true then he needs to come onto twitter ASAP and explain for his own sake.

That's the opposite of what he needs to do. Baiting a dramatic 20 year old into a poorly thought out response is exactly what Jeffree is aiming at here."
6353,2020-06-28 19:09:45,hh8xbg,Twitter won't be enough. This needs a lawsuit
6354,2020-06-28 19:09:08,hh8xbg,I don‚Äôt think James needs to do anything. It‚Äôs just one third-hand rumour from a third-rate provocateur.
6355,2020-06-28 19:13:23,hh8xbg,"He already addressed it. The first thing he says on his ""no more lies"" video is that he is a virgin!"

6357,2020-06-29 04:48:06,hh8xbg,Jeffree was ALLEGEDLY given the recording he did not take it. There is no shred of evidence that it even is credible. It is a distraction and manipulation tool.
6358,2020-06-29 04:50:49,hh8xbg,We don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs the victim speaking. Jeffree made it sound like a secondhand account.
6359,2020-06-29 04:48:12,hh8xbg,"If it's a voice memo then it's like a voice text message. So, the sender recorded their message and sent it. At least, that's how mine work."
6360,2020-06-29 07:50:44,hh8xbg,dont voice memos delete after a certain amount of time? if he has the recording to play for banks a year after bye sister he must have recorded it at some point
6361,2020-06-29 23:05:04,hh8xbg,"Haha, jeffreethereceipts"
6362,2020-06-29 23:05:30,hh8xbg,"SAME. I mean a shitty song of Shane‚Äôs started autoplaying. Turns out he played an obnoxious shitty egotistical youtuber in a movie called ‚Äúinternet famous‚Äù in 2016, and that song was for the movie? It‚Äôs weird."
6363,2020-06-29 23:17:17,hh8xbg,Ngl Superluv by Shane kinda slaps...üò¨üò¨
6364,2020-06-30 03:19:38,hh8xbg,Yes! She really went to great lengths to make everything as easily digestible and comprehensive as possible. It's a fantastic video.
6365,2020-06-30 03:23:12,hh8xbg,I love Stephanie! She did a great job of summarising those particular incidents. Here‚Äôs a link for anyone who hasn‚Äôt watched yet: https://youtu.be/Z3VXTwtXUE8

6368,2020-06-28 16:23:14,hh8xbg,She just said on twitter she won't defend or help anyone and that she is addressing everything

6372,2020-06-29 05:56:47,hh8xbg,"I didnt watch the ""docuseries"", what did he do that would be considered sexual harassment?"
6373,2020-06-29 04:49:22,hh8xbg,"I have a terrible memory, I can‚Äôt remember seeing any sexual harassment or inappropriate behaviour in the meetings? Is there anything you specifically remember?"
6374,2020-06-29 04:58:04,hh8xbg,Its late at night so my memory just might be shit but I don't remember sexual harassment in the workplace in the J* series or even predatory business practices.

6397,2020-06-28 23:51:04,hh8xbg,"Realistically my guess is Shane will come out with another statement addressed to the Smith family and I hope to god Trayvon Martin‚Äôs family. Then he‚Äôll announce a long break from YT. 

I‚Äôm hoping Nikki Limo and Steve Greene from the talk shit challenge will issue an ACTUAL apology.

I don‚Äôt see Tati releasing anything. And idk on Jeffree. I haven‚Äôt been following the stuff with specifically him but I expect he‚Äôll somehow get out of this with minimal damage compared to Shane. He somehow always manages to."
6398,2020-06-28 23:58:02,hh8xbg,More and more shit about Shane is coming out. I kinda hope the Smith‚Äôs escalate this somehow and get him deplatformed
6399,2020-06-28 23:31:51,hh8xbg,"This phrasing is cursed. 

Anytime someone says this, something a thousand times worse comes out."
6400,2020-06-29 00:17:59,hh8xbg,I hope the Smiths take Jeffree down as well as Shane
6401,2020-06-28 23:32:47,hh8xbg,"Congrats, you have now open another door to more stuff Shane has done in his past that was terrible!"
6402,2020-06-29 02:47:08,hh8xbg,I want a video from Will Smith himself exposing and ending both Jonkle Sweat and Shart Dyson‚Äôs careers.
6403,2020-06-30 02:45:48,hh8xbg,Tatted Worcestershire. ADD THIS TO THE LIST FOR OUR DESCENDANTS TO SEE
6404,2020-06-30 02:14:49,hh8xbg,"Tatted Worcestershire.  üòÇ Omg, we‚Äôve been so remiss on Tati, I hope there‚Äôs extra room on the spreadsheet for her."
6405,2020-06-28 20:03:23,hh8xbg,"So, she pointed out something VERY interesting in that, that I didn‚Äôt know, but I think it‚Äôs interesting;

The channel, popblast, had over 600K subscribers.

When Shane discussed this on the H3H3 podcast, he claimed it was a fan, who really loved Shane Dawson, and his conspiracy theories (he implied it was a kid, but I don‚Äôt think he knows). The channel uploaded the original video claiming Shane was a pedophile- including the clips from the podcast thats recirculating (people are using the twitter shortened clip that circulated at the time). The rest of the main video also said ‚Äúproof‚Äù of Shane being a ‚Äúpedo‚Äù included Ryland and his ex Lisa both having baby faces.

So once the shortened video reached twitter: Shane was trending on twitter for 48 hours straight (as in the top of the trending, apparently a record). Soon after it gained traction; the channel put out some cryptic videos with Morse code. There were a few. Including a transfer from one of the Paul brothers managers. So people went IN and thought that it was this massive conspiracy- that the Paul brothers had orchestrated in an effort to divert attention from Logan Paul, who had the time, had just don‚Äôt that HORRIFIC video in the Forrest; which was right after he acted so fucking disrespectful and disgusting in Japan for a week or so.

So essentially; a lot of people brushed it off as a conspiracy theory, that it was a distraction from Logan Paul."

6409,2020-06-28 15:19:35,hh8xbg,"I mean I think if that‚Äôs a possibility then I would hope he or his family would log out of his accounts and then get him professional help. 

Tbh I don‚Äôt think someone harming themselves is anyone‚Äôs fault, it‚Äôs a symptom of an illness and if Shane‚Äôs anxiety is really that bad then he should get help. He has more than enough money to do an inpatient or outpatient program."
6410,2020-06-28 18:52:42,hh8xbg,Blaire said the same thing as Ashley Kyle in her video though.
6411,2020-06-28 18:49:39,hh8xbg,I completely agree.
6412,2020-06-28 19:07:25,hh8xbg,FACTS
6413,2020-06-28 19:45:24,hh8xbg,Nah. This particular clique is terrible. There are still lots of great people making content.
6414,2020-06-28 20:17:10,hh8xbg,"I completely agree with you. I unfollowed all of the participating BGs during D2 and never resubscribed to any. I unsubbed from Shane during the Jake Paul series and never resubbed. I don't even know why I'm so invested now, I guess I feel like I'm lacking real resolution from D2 and I feel disgusted with myself that I ever enjoyed Shane Dawson's content. It really seems that the youtube environment was rewarding the most horrible people to get to the top. We need to stop giving them views."
6415,2020-06-29 01:45:19,hh8xbg,"The term for that is ""shadowboxing"" and it is unnecessary. The burden of proof is on the person who made the accusation."

6417,2020-06-29 02:34:43,hh8xbg,"My conspiracy theory is that it was james treem that dig you all this stuff. If you think about it, would you sit back if you were james and had his resources, knowing he had this intel or would you hire a detective and arm yourself too. This could not have been better if he tried. 

If I were trying it would make sense to tie myself in with my enemies enemies, it would make sense to put together that show to create a reason why folks might want to suck up and potentusl drop dirt. I'd go after folks around JS like lushious going after rich with accusations of racism and nick as a bully etc etc. then I'd wait til right around the time the one year hit and start getting all the bombs to drop while I cried in my near that I was close to suicide. Not saying he did that but I'm just saying it's odd that all of this stuff came out from years and years back out of nowhere and it seems so tightly out together from a media perspective. Very little attention is being paid to WHAT Blair heard abc more that Jeffree holds dirt to silence people. James is either very lucky that all these things played out as they did or he nudged some of it along. I coukd see the dahvie and the Shane old vids stuff as being a product of a pi."
6418,2020-06-28 14:02:21,hh8xbg,I think Tittie Wetsoup will be releasing her new well researched line of gummy bears that treat covid and eliminate backstabbing influencer friends.

6424,2020-06-28 13:54:13,hh8xbg,I wonder how many more dumbass lyric videos we'd have had if she didn't get thoroughly roasted for her cryptic shit in the last one lol. Apparently she even blocked one of the people who made one of the comments she hid ü§°ü§° it was literally just telling her to stop posting cryptic shit lmao
6425,2020-06-28 14:03:42,hh8xbg,"I wouldn‚Äôt if I was her. It‚Äôs best that she stay out of this. It‚Äôs past James and the only reason it‚Äôs a ‚Äúthing‚Äù right now is because Shane brought it up. I‚Äôd just let the other news bury the rumors. Truthfully, I think she had a miscarriage and that‚Äôs what the vague posting is about."
6426,2020-06-28 14:00:48,hh8xbg,"i feel like she was hoping to really drag out her cryptic nonsense and savor everyone waiting for her to bestow wisdom on them then drop her video as the headline act but then like the smiths got involved and it really upstaged her so now unless she's got something huge that can take j\* down it's just gonna be like ""yeah ok tati you're still irrelevant"""
6427,2020-06-28 14:11:21,hh8xbg,Holy shit Turtle Wheatbread I'M SCREAMING ü§£ü§£üíÄüíÄ
6428,2020-06-29 23:40:29,hh8xbg,Totally agree! This is now her full time  job and she has an editor but so many of her videos she can‚Äôt quite remember what she is referencing. It‚Äôs honestly just lazy - like pause filming and go and check instead of spreading this misinformed stale tea.
6429,2020-06-29 23:39:39,hh8xbg,"i didn't like how she just pushed on the idea that ""A lot of influencers have heard this voice memo"" with out any facts? Like. You were gonna go to law school and instead of trying to dig into what blaire was saying you're just accepting it as true????? like you didn't do enough research to realize only two people we know of have heard this memo??

&#x200B;

and if other people have heard it, this is the time to say ""JEffree shared it with me as well"" Like you don't need to discuss the content, just talk about jeffree's actions."
6430,2020-06-29 23:44:40,hh8xbg,"Didn't she claim Shane was manipulated or something? I forgot which video it was, but in the comment section people were criticizing her for being biased in favor of Shane."
6431,2020-06-30 01:26:55,hh8xbg,"Did she really say that? Jesus. This is so infuriating to read. Some straight women really need to get their heads out of their asses and realise homophobia is still a thing, and that it benefits them."
6432,2020-06-30 01:43:40,hh8xbg,"i unsubscribed to her a long time ago because she doesn't seem all that knowledgeable of social issues lol it really bothered me, especially for someone that wants to do commentary. i do agree that JC's fame has to do with him being a man, but when did tati (or anyone really) get cancelled lol."
6433,2020-06-30 00:18:02,hh8xbg,"Haven't seen the video, but I need this white feminist narrative that acts like white women getting ""canceled"" for saying/doing racist or problematic things to just fade away because it enables women who are privileged and in positions of power to act like victims. And I am not saying that there isn't truth to the idea that the beauty community, like every other community, has misogynistic qualities lol but like, Tati is a grown woman and has cultivated an audience of empathetic, decent people, some of whom had a moral problem with her behavior. 

Also of course Tati survived her cancellation because cancel culture rarely exists for powerful people."
6434,2020-06-28 17:44:04,hh8xbg,On her instagram story she elaborates
6435,2020-06-28 19:36:21,hh8xbg,I think she was still in shock. I would be too tbh if someone I'm close with turns out to be glorifying pedophilia.
6436,2020-06-28 19:59:23,hh8xbg,"That could just be the network tho, they will definitely capitalize for free publicity."

6438,2020-06-28 22:18:44,hh8xbg,"She also mentioned being afraid for her life on her podcast in the context of youtube being against her, I believe. So who knows honestly?"
6439,2020-06-28 22:33:56,hh8xbg,Afraid that her reputation would get overshadowed by Shame and Jofveve's clownery maybe.

6448,2020-06-29 04:35:39,hh8xbg,"Have you seen or heard about the disturbing parody he made of Taylor Swift Blank space 5 years ago where he stalked, sexually assaulted and killed Taylor in the video, Taylor team reported and removed the video and he started batching about it and encouraged all his fans to start hating on her calling her a bitch, unable to take a joke, etc.?
Like the woman has legit stalkers and carries around a first aid kit at all times in fear of being stabbed and he still put out shit like that and threw a tantrum when she didnt find it amusing.

Not as bad as some of the other videos out there (like the Willow one holy shit) but still really disturbing imo."

6456,2020-06-29 20:53:44,hh8xbg,Not to Shane-fend but that Taylor's record company was having a lot of parody's taken down at the tine so it probably would have happened regardless.
6457,2020-06-29 20:42:55,hh8xbg,Fun fact. Shane twitted when he uploaded it tagging Taylor. So Taylor saw it and made Shane take it down.
6458,2020-06-29 21:38:25,hh8xbg,I just watched it and I‚Äôm so disturbed. How did he get away with all of this psychotic crap for so long? He has serious serious issues. I didn‚Äôt expect it to be so graphic. He needs to admit himself to a hospital.

6465,2020-06-28 13:00:50,hh8xbg,"I have no idea how people forget that at least three whole adults knew what Tati was going to do and didn't stop her (her husband, Cristine and Ben). I guess someone could influence her to do something, but she's an adult with and adult support network and still chose to do that."
6466,2020-06-28 17:23:21,hh8xbg,Right.. not sure if I even believe them or not. Maybe its JS tactic to get James cancelled again

6468,2020-06-28 17:23:40,hh8xbg,Exactly what I thought!
6469,2020-06-28 18:44:52,hh8xbg,My hope is that a lot of people just don‚Äôt know who she is and are jumping on the bandwagon of anyone who adds to the drama. The number of ‚ÄúBlaire has no reason to lie at all!!!‚Äù comments are definitely sus though lol

6471,2020-06-28 18:43:55,hh8xbg,There‚Äôs defo some people who like her/don‚Äôt know much about her acting like she‚Äôs the 2nd messiah. There was legit a friend of hers commenting earlier saying they wanted to give her a hug.

6473,2020-06-29 09:45:18,hh8xbg,The conversation around this could lead to a search warrant of his home and digital media maybe. I‚Äôm no judge or lawyer... but I could see him facing legal charges if one of these kids‚Äô parents decided to go after him.
6474,2020-06-28 06:19:50,hh8xbg,Right?
6475,2020-06-28 06:53:41,hh8xbg,Yep
6476,2020-06-28 13:31:17,hh8xbg,Bitch we bored üò£
6477,2020-06-28 13:04:43,hh8xbg,">Are yall ok?

No ‚úåÔ∏èüôÇ"
6478,2020-06-28 16:53:54,hh8xbg,"And he is just talking about Shane (of course). I wonder if next Jaffar Death Star comes out and distances himself from Shane because he hopes, that would help him in any way üôÑ"
6479,2020-06-28 17:14:21,hh8xbg,He is wearing a shirt with a pig on it.  Is it a dig at SD?
6480,2020-06-28 18:51:49,hh8xbg,Following
6481,2020-06-28 21:41:25,hh8xbg,Oh wait he was JS friend back in the day! What happened to him?
6482,2020-06-28 21:41:47,hh8xbg,"Yes. I unfortunately used to find that humour and his prank calls funny 12 years ago, but quickly realised how terrible it was once I was out of my teens. Billy went to great lengths to disassociate from that name. I think there are a few videos floating around still."
6483,2020-06-28 21:40:44,hh8xbg,That sounds familiar
6484,2020-06-28 22:49:26,hh8xbg,"I keep saying this, it's ridiculous that channels talking about the videos on Shane's channel have to censor words to describe what't in Shane's videos... all the while Shane's videos are up and monetised for over a decade. WTF."
6485,2020-06-28 22:51:27,hh8xbg,"My question is why would someone leave that up and not realize how awful it was. Meaning Shane - if he's not that person anymore, why didn't he take it down?"
6486,2020-06-28 23:23:06,hh8xbg,Y‚Äôall need to stop spreading misinformation and verify it first. I went and checked. It‚Äôs not on sale.
6487,2020-06-29 22:06:38,hh8xbg,"Everyone who was saying ""WHY WOULD SHE LIE WHAT WOULD SHE HAVE TO GAIN FROM THIS?!"" 

She's already a controversial YouTuber, getting attention for literally anything is a gain."
6488,2020-06-29 22:03:32,hh8xbg,">""You can expect me to go back to doing trans/LGBT content... The world I dipped my toe into yesterday is NOT for me"" (Blaire)So basically Blaire used this scandal to get her name out to the mainstream, and now she can radicalize more people with her transphobic and white supremacist views.

She's what now? Why did anyone think that she was credible"
6489,2020-06-29 23:30:59,hh8xbg,How is she a white supremacist? I am genuinely curious.
6490,2020-06-29 22:14:09,hh8xbg,Why do you think she's a white supremacist and a transphobe? Please share cause I disagree but I want to know more.
6491,2020-06-29 04:18:13,hh8xbg,"Yes. I agree that he needs to be held accountable, but I‚Äôve definitely been worrying about Shane. I hope his loved ones are close to him and keeping him safe. Nobody needs a tragedy out of this - I‚Äôm pretty doom and gloom by nature though so of course my mind would go there. If I were Ryland, I would keep him completely off social media for the rest of the week - uninstall twitter, ig, turn off notifications for everything except stupid games."
6492,2020-06-29 04:14:44,hh8xbg,"That's because you aren't a bad person, take that as a good thing, you don't want someone to hurt themselves."
6493,2020-06-29 04:14:46,hh8xbg,[removed]
6494,2020-06-29 04:04:53,hh8xbg,"It‚Äôs difficult though because unlike James being dragged, all people are doing is exposing concrete evidence of things that have actually happened. Nobodies making up lies about him, it‚Äôs simply karma coming to bite him in the ass. 

That being said he has Ryland, Andrew , his mother, Rylands family too. Personally I think they‚Äôre mostly good people and will be there for him through this."
6495,2020-06-29 03:52:43,hh8xbg,I‚Äôm sure he realized he can‚Äôt be redeemed once the Smiths tweeted
6496,2020-06-29 04:02:32,hh8xbg,You feel that way because he constantly speaks of his mental state and wants you to worry about it. It‚Äôs like when you break up with a guy who threatens self harm after he cheats on you
6497,2020-06-29 05:18:23,hh8xbg,"I watched him a lot as a kid and he was always very open about his depression and I too am really really concerned about his well being. He deserves being held accountable, but I hope he has a good support system at home because everything going on is enough to drive anyone over the edge."
6498,2020-06-29 04:01:04,hh8xbg,"Honestly, as much as both Shane and Jeff deserve to be held accountable I worry about them both. This is in no way an excuse for them but a healthy mind doesnt do or say these kind of things. I don't think either of them are actively trying to be terrible people but are acting out of their own mental issues. I don't want to see their lives ruined, the best case scenario is for both of them to retire out of the spotlight and seek therapy."
6499,2020-06-29 03:56:31,hh8xbg,i trust his family to take care of him. this has been a long time coming.
6500,2020-06-29 04:08:26,hh8xbg,Remember his 4 page term paper. That‚Äôs how he really feels right now. Don‚Äôt be bamboozled by his BS acting for a camera.
6501,2020-06-29 04:00:46,hh8xbg,"Yep. I hope that he is with his friends and family right now and is under the care of a therapist and psychiatrist, should he need medication."
6502,2020-06-29 03:54:29,hh8xbg,Yes.
6503,2020-06-29 04:04:26,hh8xbg,"No, I don't think he feels actual remorse and has enough money to hide away until this blows over."
6504,2020-06-28 08:24:51,hh8xbg,Aww it's not the real peppa. That would have been iconic lol
6505,2020-06-28 16:09:08,hh8xbg,"So he's managed to piss off the Barbz, the Ivy League, AND The Beyhive? Yikes."
6506,2020-06-28 22:49:15,hh8xbg,omg what if he gets papa johns-ed
6507,2020-06-28 22:44:47,hh8xbg,"The sad thing is, Jeffree could be cancelled from YouTube and the beauty industry altogether but he will still be mega rich. Didn't he say he also invests in the marijuana industry? He has enough money to still be famous in other ways so sadly I don't think we will ever see the back of him.

I do wonder if any of the people outside of YouTube that he works with are paying any attention to this."
6508,2020-06-28 22:38:42,hh8xbg,Oh that Jeff Cohen person? He certainly didn‚Äôt vet Shane Dawson very well before he agreed to the J ‚≠êÔ∏è+Shane Dawson partnership huh? If his little trolls had done their homework on Shane they would have seen so much unsavory sh!t that no reputable businessman would EVER be affiliated with.
6509,2020-06-29 14:28:27,hh8xbg,"Her suddenly posting these cryptic song tweets during this shitstorm- she knows exactly what she's doing.

If she's just getting people riled up for no reason, that's shitty on her part, cuz there's some SERIOUS allegations going on here."
6510,2020-06-29 15:02:24,hh8xbg,"Right! I will personal lift Tati on my shoulders and start the ‚ÄúTati, Tati‚Äù chant if she expose Shane & Jeffree with real evidence. 

Also, it would be wild if the Dolan twins of all people admitted to what they know about the situation. They have to power to end someone‚Äôs career right now, but knowing them they will probably just put out a podcast titled ‚Äúwhy we don‚Äôt feed into drama.‚Äù"
6511,2020-06-29 14:26:17,hh8xbg,"I have a feeling there will be a video from Tati today... I don't know anything more than you do, but I have a feeling."
6512,2020-06-28 18:44:23,hh8xbg,I think if it was legit the victim saying something in a voice mail I would believe it. But because it hasn‚Äôt come out at all I don‚Äôt believe it exists
6513,2020-06-28 21:29:17,hh8xbg,"What‚Äôs really bothering me is everyone knows about the SA and they keep saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to tell their story. Well hinting at it isn‚Äôt helpful either. Y‚Äôall should have just not said anything. JC would have been taken down eventually. (If Allegations are true). I always believe victims but this has add so much doubt for me. I really hope it‚Äôs no victim for their on well being. 

Also I sorry for what happened to you, I believe you"
6514,2020-06-28 21:22:42,hh8xbg,Take care of yourself friend.
6515,2020-06-28 21:42:29,hh8xbg,take care and be safe <3
6516,2020-06-28 23:17:41,hh8xbg,This comment and these nicknames lol
6517,2020-06-29 01:57:55,hh8xbg,Its things like this that make me convinced the voice memo either doesn't exist or isn't reputable
6518,2020-06-29 02:05:52,hh8xbg,[deleted]
6519,2020-06-29 01:52:17,hh8xbg,Why would he do that when he could hold on to it for a time when he could personally gain something for having it. He played the long game.
6520,2020-06-29 02:02:40,hh8xbg,It‚Äôs illegal to record someone without their knowledge in a lot of states so *if* it is real there may have been legal intervention that stopped him from sharing it
6521,2020-06-29 23:29:04,hh8xbg,"I know that Phil was in shanes pocket since Shane used Phil's company to get ads, so I'm not shocked he dragged his feet"
6522,2020-06-30 03:52:51,hh8xbg,"same. I just think james probably had a lawyer tell him ""don't do that"". Last year he probably would have gone on several crazy twitter rants about this sort of thing, but I think he's got a PR team and lawyers now who are keeping him reigned in."
6523,2020-06-30 04:07:59,hh8xbg,I think everyone is reading into every little thing.. which is why this thread is active lol.
6524,2020-06-30 03:57:26,hh8xbg,"Yeah, I thought it was strange he narrowed in on that. I love Peter but that was just kind of ""meh"" for me lol. There are valid reasons for him to unlike those videos, including him just... not wanting to deal with the potential fallout."
6525,2020-06-30 03:52:55,hh8xbg,I love Peter monn but he always reads into things a bit too much.
6526,2020-06-30 04:18:34,hh8xbg,He seems way too excited about all of this imo.
6527,2020-06-28 07:11:42,hh8xbg,Which NYT reporter? Taylor Lorenz? Because this is her beat.
6528,2020-06-28 14:44:43,hh8xbg,"Honestly worst case scenario it changes nothing 

Best case scenario: Blaire, Shane, AND J* are cancelled"
6529,2020-06-28 14:49:49,hh8xbg,You would have to be an absolute moron to come out with a video defending Shane but sadly people will at some point. Hope whoever does is ready to take the heat and kill their own careers.
6530,2020-06-29 23:15:49,hh8xbg,The call when they planned what she was going to say and then gave Jeffree her Venmo?
6531,2020-06-29 23:24:55,hh8xbg,"Afaik it was before she plagiarized and falsely presented tehmimis video and research, a week before Jefeces appeared on Chris Hansen"
6532,2020-06-28 05:34:32,hh8xbg,He unliked it.
6533,2020-06-28 06:03:47,hh8xbg,He definitely unliked those tweets.
6534,2020-06-28 06:00:44,hh8xbg,i hope shayla is somewhere laughing and having a good time. the aggressiveness in those ig clips scared me
6535,2020-06-28 06:38:43,hh8xbg,"To the stans, if it didn‚Äôt happen TODAY then it‚Äôs ‚Äúin the past and you need to get over it‚Äù. And even if it did happen today, he‚Äôs ‚Äúgoing through stuff and has a traumatic past‚Äù. Nothing gets through to them."

6540,2020-06-28 15:22:02,hh8xbg,Interested in seeing what she‚Äôll say. Probably nothing we didn‚Äôt already know though..
6541,2020-06-28 15:23:00,hh8xbg,10 am or Pm?
6542,2020-06-28 15:37:06,hh8xbg,Will someone upload a compilation of her statements/clownery? I won't be able to make the time and I wouldn't be surprised if she deletes it

Throwing it in the bin, just hurts the environment. Burning it is nearly as bad, since presumedly you will purchase another palette to replace it (bad for the environment)."

6555,2020-06-28 18:49:05,hh8xbg,What is she saying? I don't have insta
6556,2020-06-28 18:58:16,hh8xbg,Unintentionally? She did this on purpose they‚Äôve been friends for years. She even hinted at it a few days ago when she had that insta story about Jernigan Spatula being a ‚Äúmonster‚Äù and Shane being the real ‚Äúvictim‚Äù in it all. They‚Äôre all trash.
6557,2020-06-28 18:58:25,hh8xbg,Perhaps intentionally though
6558,2020-06-28 18:56:09,hh8xbg,Where? Cause I still see him getting dragged and he‚Äôs still at the top of twitter moments lol
6559,2020-06-28 18:53:55,hh8xbg,"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unintentionally, they‚Äôve been friends forever"
6560,2020-06-28 21:00:59,hh8xbg,idk I doubt that. I really don't think he is doing well right now mentally or in any way. The things he did are gross and he tried ignoring it for so long and not it is being shown on the world's stage. Imagine having an actually famous family calling you out for your disgusting shit! I would be on the verge of something really bad
6561,2020-06-29 03:04:25,hh8xbg,"Honestly I think they might. It would probably help his case, seeing his genuine reactions and how he really feels. It would feel more authentic than that ‚Äòapology‚Äô with 50 jump cuts"
6562,2020-06-29 01:45:44,hh8xbg,"Didn't Shane said in his apology that he spoke with her and she was like ""no, it's fine, that's how we \[her family\] joke""? As in, implying his whole family make sexual jokes to the kids."

6566,2020-06-29 15:56:40,hh8xbg,Damon‚Äôs most recent tweets are condemning Blaire White and her boyfriend (which they absolutely deserve to be) so I guess that means Shane has turned on Blaire? But Blaire already said she was upset with Shane‚Äôs pedo behavior üßê
6567,2020-06-29 21:53:23,hh8xbg,Damon Fizzy is a YouTuber from like 5-10 years ago. I believe he was a Shane fan/got noticed/befriended by Shane back then for a bit. He was one of the emo/scene babyfaced young adults from that time frame. Interested to know why Shane would follow him after all these years..
6568,2020-06-29 15:55:40,hh8xbg,He‚Äôs transgender and spoke out against Blaire in his recent tweets
6569,2020-06-29 19:50:49,hh8xbg,I think James has said she was one of the only youtube people to reach out to him when all of this happened last year
6570,2020-06-28 19:13:56,hh8xbg,"If Jeffree helped Blaire orchestrate this then he's smarter than I thought. She titled the video something against Jeffree and made it seem like she doesn't support him, so it would seem credible to the audience. However she spent the whole time accusing James. Jeffree has been so quiet. I doubt he's doing nothing."

6609,2020-06-28 18:35:43,hh8xbg,Why didn't you guys do the same for Shane's apology video? Im honestly asking
6610,2020-06-29 11:53:38,hh8xbg,"Honestly, if I was the victim, and I sent a voice note to someone I trusted in confidence, I‚Äôd probably like a heads up it was being passed around the entire community as some sort of sick social currency. I think Blaire did the right thing by reaching out and letting them know while trying to comfort them. She mentioned she‚Äôs also a survivor and sounds like she was trying to give them some sort of support which giving the circumstances does seem like the right thing to do."
6611,2020-06-29 13:41:49,hh8xbg,"Blaire's reasoning for making the video was contrived at best. ""I just need your help - what should I do?"" And her dumbass followers aren't picking up on how seriously wrong of a thing this is to do."
6612,2020-06-29 14:08:01,hh8xbg,Why do you think so? Ashley Kyle came forward and said the same thing before anything with Shane started.
6613,2020-06-28 16:44:26,hh8xbg,Look under Jaden‚Äôs tweet. He pretended to jerk off and moaned a ton to a photo of Willow when she was 11.

6615,2020-06-28 19:22:23,hh8xbg,"Yes, but . . .

-Yes, but it's expensive.

-Yes, but the lawsuit probably wouldn't get as much attention as the initial allegations.

-Yes, but James Charles would have to consent to having his whole life trolled through during the discovery phase of the trial.

-Yes, but it could backfire and make him seem more guilty to certain people. 

He could. I think he probably _should_. But there are valid reasons why he might not."
6616,2020-06-28 19:22:36,hh8xbg,"Technically yes. Which is why it is so stupid to have this ""memo"" floating around and telling people about it. If it is fake then yeah he could sue for definition and Blair White Supremacist would go down as well. But if it is true then they could be charged with withholding information and maybe ading and abbeting. ( im not a lawyer, this is me speculating)"

It's creepy as AF with Shane admitting that he was 19 and Lucas/Fred was ""around"" 15 talking on AIM with him. What he says is that Fred asked him to come over his hotel room, which is weird as fuck, but by the end of the story Shane says he was about to go meet him. Then Shane made some inappropriate comment to 15 year old Fred about blowing him and Fred just blocked him after that."

6649,2020-06-28 18:41:23,hh8xbg,I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs going to say anything unless this blows up and people are extremely focused on Shane atm that they hardly care about anyone else. I‚Äôve barely seen JS or JC mentioned in the past few days.
6650,2020-06-28 18:38:32,hh8xbg,"Would he need to? As far as I can tell, Blaire's video hasn't made any waves. I think after the way people got burnt last year, they're a lot more cautious in believing that JC was a predator/sexually assaulted someone. They'll probably wait for proof.

Edit to add: a quick survey on the video's comments seems to shape much of that idea. Some even brought up the sexual allegations that have been levied up against Jebbediah in the past (of which, we have proof)."
6651,2020-06-28 18:46:16,hh8xbg,Be happy you don‚Äôt understand how Jeffree‚Äôs sick twisted mind works. That‚Äôs a good thing.
6652,2020-06-29 12:21:46,hh8xbg,Couldnt the victim sue J*? Something is really fishy about this voice memo situation. It just doesnt make sense. Why send it to J*? Im thinking J* has dirt on whoever is on this voice memo...and how does J* know for sure another yter raped someone?
6653,2020-06-29 11:23:43,hh8xbg,"Sounded like whoever she reached out to left her on read, can't blame them üò¨"
6654,2020-06-29 11:27:46,hh8xbg,"I‚Äôm confused because I feel like Blaire came at Jeffree hard. She barely talked about James Charles and put more focus that Jeffree is blackmailing youtubers with this voice memo and that he ALSO knows about another situation of alleged rape, and is keeping quiet about it and probably blackmailing the other party as well.
Idk what more you guys want from Blaire, like a blood oath or her first born child? The title of the video is literally ‚ÄúJeffree Star is a monster‚Äù."
6655,2020-06-29 12:41:24,hh8xbg,"That‚Äôs very true - if someone were confiding in me about something as serious as this, the LAST thing I‚Äôd do is pull out my phone and start recording."
6656,2020-06-28 11:31:26,hh8xbg,"That was the same thing that struck me too. All this love for Andrew because he has a charming laugh, but he's an enabler too. 

Shane admits(for a very long time now) he's trying to work on his issues which is a lot more than a lot of problematic people can admit."

6658,2020-06-28 11:13:55,hh8xbg,"I don't think you have a realistic view of what being human is like. You meet someone, you get along and you fall in love or become friends. Once that happens it is hard to shake off unless you're heartless. You don't do all these calculations

If this is the standard then the millions upon millions of people that liked Shanes content from the past 2 years are bad people as well. I'm sure more than half this subreddit would fit that description

Is Drew Monson a bad a person too? Jenna Marbles? Julien? Philip Defranco? They have all associated with and supported Shane. Come on."
6659,2020-06-28 11:07:33,hh8xbg,"I can see this point, but I also think it‚Äôs kinda similar to Shane‚Äôs viewers who have supported him up until this point."
6660,2020-06-28 11:24:54,hh8xbg,The problem here is nobody is perfect. Everyone has the potential to be a nasty motherfucker. That's what's interesting about cancel culture. You can just pretty much banish someone for things they've said and label them a bad person no matter how much good they've collectively done. If one bad apple spoils the bunch then does that mean no good apples exist?
6661,2020-06-28 17:46:03,hh8xbg,If the victim doesn‚Äôt cooperate then it‚Äôs pointless

6665,2020-06-28 18:40:38,hh8xbg,The video makes him look awful even if the allegations are true
6666,2020-06-28 18:37:09,hh8xbg,"i mean he technically could, but that also means that the voice memo would be leaked and investigated. I‚Äôm pretty sure jafar has enough blackmail on james to keep him quiet."
6667,2020-06-28 17:23:45,hh8xbg,She can‚Äôt put a sexual assault victim who doesn‚Äôt want to be outed
6668,2020-06-28 17:29:15,hh8xbg,"At least she could show that Jeffre actually dmed her, no receipts of their conversation is really shady"
6669,2020-06-28 17:22:59,hh8xbg,"I don't get the point of her video, she made no real new points, most of this stuff is what we knew last year apart from a new victim and a different youtuber j* knew about."

6672,2020-06-28 17:27:11,hh8xbg,"Yes, she is trash let‚Äôs not forget it"
6673,2020-06-28 19:41:20,hh8xbg,It is no one's job to go to the police on a victim's behalf unless the victim is a minor. I absolutely agree Blair is terrible but people gotta stop bringing up the police when they don't do shit for SA victims.

6677,2020-06-29 16:41:27,hh8xbg,Its probably going to be some funny video about pranks or something. They have no obligation to insert themselves in this mess.

6679,2020-06-29 16:15:05,hh8xbg,Wait what? Have I missed something with them and Shane?
6680,2020-06-29 17:09:45,hh8xbg,"Eh, there's no video til the video's uploaded, you know? Chances are it's just gonna be their usual content."
6681,2020-06-29 16:26:11,hh8xbg,Am I the only one finding the timing of this suspicious?
6682,2020-06-29 16:35:03,hh8xbg,I saw that they were trending on twitter but apparently they're releasing a podcast. I'm not surprised if the video they upload only pertains to that
6683,2020-06-29 17:19:10,hh8xbg,They wouldn‚Äôt get involved in something like this.
6684,2020-06-29 16:19:15,hh8xbg,Do we know at what time they‚Äôll upload?
6685,2020-06-29 16:24:29,hh8xbg,Oh boy.....
6686,2020-06-28 10:52:18,hh8xbg,I hope he takes this opportunity to truly seek help and unpack everything that happened in his past and led him to where he is today. I too use humour to deal with trauma. Except there is nothing humorous about Shane's old stuff.
6687,2020-06-28 11:21:09,hh8xbg,"i dont mean this in a mean way but i see a lot of people saying this and its a deflection, even though i'm sure you don't mean it to be. it has the same effect as shane bringing up his anxiety/trauma as a way to shield against being held fully accountable. we have a responsibility to a certain level of decency by not like, chasing him down the street or whatever, but millions of people reacting with disgust to the truth about him is only proportional to the millions of people who saw him normalising and pushing hurtful and damaging concepts.   it's beyond petty youtube drama because what he did is beyond petty youtube drama.

 ""i'm worried that making him face up to consequences of his own actions will lead to him hurting himself"" is an old, old abuse tool used to manipulate people into letting someone out of consequences. i don't want him to hurt himself, but he was responsible for his actions in putting these videos online, he's responsible for his actions now in how he engages with what's happening. he has it well within his power to turn the internet off, get therapy, and deal with this in a healthy way."
6688,2020-06-28 11:16:10,hh8xbg,"While I agree I hope he does not hurt himself. He deserves this backlash, and to see how many people he has hurt, what he has done is horrific"
6689,2020-06-28 11:02:36,hh8xbg,Give your worry to those affected by systemic racism who have higher rates of mental illness and can‚Äôt afford therapy and medical treatment.
6690,2020-06-28 10:45:08,hh8xbg,I don‚Äôt support him but I hope he won‚Äôt harm himself.
6691,2020-06-28 10:49:50,hh8xbg,"I agree but the thing is, it‚Äôs all on the Internet. Nobodies forcing him to read tweets, nobodies forcing him to do anything. He has every right to disappear from the Internet and not read a single hate comment. He is a grown ass adult and nothing is stopping him from retiring"
6692,2020-06-28 10:51:21,hh8xbg,"I am absolutely disgusted in his behaviour, but yes, I am worried about that. I hope he‚Äôs not alone right now."

Re: whether police need to be involved, I don't think any of us here can actually call that. Blaire's the one who's heard the memo not us, and her judgement call has been to make a dramatic video. Whether that's because what she heard was just tea, or she's being irresponsible, we don't know."
6701,2020-06-29 01:54:26,hh8xbg,I recommend avoiding Blair White like the plague.
6702,2020-06-29 18:30:06,hh8xbg,"based on her last instastory, i think joffrey tried to manipulate her (and other youtubers probably) by sending them his receipts and telling them, that the victim doesn't want to come out. that way they would be on jeffree's side again, because - well, he was right all along.

don't forget james adressed all the allegations towards him a year ago, saying nothing ever happened with grayson and he even called james to ask him if he's okay. so no, i don't believe james molested someone in their sleep as Jof said."
6703,2020-06-29 18:29:30,hh8xbg,"What I suspect happened is that Tati and Blaire complained to J\* about James Charles over petty nonsense (the \~sugar bear\~ vitamins, being too popular and not the right ""kind"" of queer, whatever), then J\* gives them supersketchy details/voice memos/whatever and now they \*have\* to talk shit about JC publicly."
6704,2020-06-29 18:23:40,hh8xbg,I fully believe that she 100% believes it to be true from what she heard. That wasn‚Äôt acting

JS has said it's proof about James, but who knows what it really says and if she's trying to manipulate us too."
6708,2020-06-28 17:25:46,hh8xbg,"I don‚Äôt think anyone is looking over the claims on James, we‚Äôre just treading lightly as false claims are absolutely damaging.  So far we‚Äôve seen no receipts.

6710,2020-06-28 17:25:15,hh8xbg,She provided absolutely NO receipts while simultaneously bitching about Starship not providing any receipts about JCs predator allegations.

6712,2020-06-28 17:27:20,hh8xbg,Fuck James Charles & fuck the starship is what I say! They both deserve to be burned on the same stake!
6713,2020-06-28 17:31:06,hh8xbg,I think that's exactly what she's trying to say. That he somehow monitors the internet for dirt that could paint him in a bad light and tries to manipulate people into keeping silent.
6714,2020-06-28 17:34:35,hh8xbg,I‚Äôm sure multiple fans saw her comments then DM‚Äôd Jeffree.  Doesn‚Äôt take a genius to work out.
6715,2020-06-28 17:46:12,hh8xbg,Sorry to nitpick but I don‚Äôt want misinformation out there. J* isn‚Äôt a billionaire. He is thought to be worth anywhere from $75-$220 million.
6716,2020-06-28 17:43:33,hh8xbg,This perfectly describes how I feel about this whole thing lol
6717,2020-06-29 16:49:53,hh8xbg,JAMES IS RAMSEY??? What lol
6718,2020-06-29 17:38:37,hh8xbg,"Honestly Jeffree isn't as careful as little finger.

He's more a Cersei paired with Shane being Jaime. They are family, have a love hate relationship but Jaime is the better half and leaves Cersei in her time of need.

 Tati is Margery for sure, Margery has good intentions and smart wit but still falls for Cersei's trap. 

James is Sansa was a insufferable bitch at first, but grew from the tragedy Cersei (js)set up. Cersei(js)hates Sansa from the beginning and sees her as a threat to her power by marriage and beauty. Sansa saw Margery(Tati)as a sisterly/motherly figure. Margery tried to protect Sansa but in the end couldn't.

Gabriel is that in sufferable doctor Pycel who does Cersei's dirty work and sings his praises.

Next season we're all going to see Michelle phan ride in on a dragon and destroy everyone, only to die and leave everyone to a blank fresh start."
6719,2020-06-29 17:06:08,hh8xbg,I‚Äôd say James is definitely theon over Ramsey
6720,2020-06-29 16:37:36,hh8xbg,James is definitely Theon üòÇ
6721,2020-06-29 17:05:42,hh8xbg,Lol no way is James Ramsey
6722,2020-06-28 19:05:47,hh8xbg,[deleted]
6723,2020-06-28 21:11:33,hh8xbg,Omg these clips make me uncomfortable times 100000 and he made $$ off of these back then and youtube wouldnt let her keep it up at first?!? Disgusting
6724,2020-06-28 20:57:08,hh8xbg,"Agreed. However there‚Äôs a difference between ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù as in internet brutality, and then there‚Äôs choosing to withdraw support as in these people will never get my time or coin ever again.

It‚Äôs time ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
6725,2020-06-30 02:22:00,hh8xbg,If the voice memo was real they would have posted it already. Let's stop pretending J* actually gives a shit about protecting anyone but himself üôÑ
6726,2020-06-30 02:18:15,hh8xbg,"the only people who have stated they have heard it are Blaire White and Jeffree Star. Ashlye Kyle was told of it's existence but didn't hear it herself. She informed other drama channels of it I believe. So far everyone keeps saying ""I know it exists and some people have listened to it"" But no one knows who ""Some people"" are. And to top it off, a lot of people misconstrued what ashlye (And petty paige also Ig???) Said and are saying they heard it. They have not.

&#x200B;

SO. Right now. Only Blaire White and Jeffree Star have confirmed they have heard it. No one else has. And no one else has said they DIRECTLY know someone who has heard it. Just that ""people"" have heard it."
6727,2020-06-30 02:19:11,hh8xbg,Blaire White is the only one that has come forward and said she heard the voice notes. At least so far I believe.
6728,2020-06-30 02:16:51,hh8xbg,No one has actually
6729,2020-06-28 05:45:51,hh8xbg,And Jeffree too please
6730,2020-06-28 06:04:10,hh8xbg,"I mean, I think we‚Äôve all canceled him, now we‚Äôre waiting to see if YouTube does, which will mean much more in the long term."
6731,2020-06-28 05:57:11,hh8xbg,Cancelations take a while
6732,2020-06-28 05:47:51,hh8xbg,Of course but the discussion has to continue until he is canceled.
6733,2020-06-28 08:25:33,hh8xbg,"No Jeffree is worse. Shane has done horrific stuff, but Jeffree is definitely worse. Jeffree is actually evil"
6734,2020-06-28 08:13:56,hh8xbg,"They're similar characters, whose current marketing presentations differ. It's hard to pick one as worse - they're both racist misogynists that manipulate an audience for profit."
6735,2020-06-28 08:10:16,hh8xbg,"they‚Äôre both awful. Jeffree has proven to be racist, pedophilic, and an assaulter - both sexual and physical. But Shane has so much evidence of his racism and pedophilia. I mean the proof was still on his channel until today! On the other hand...who knows what Jeffree has done that people don‚Äôt have evidence for. Could be a lot more than we think."
6736,2020-06-28 10:22:49,hh8xbg,Idk either. All I do know is that they deserve each other.
6737,2020-06-29 08:30:08,hh8xbg,"I don‚Äôt know of many people using voice memos but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs uncommon necessarily. I feel like I‚Äôve seen screenshots from influencers where their entire text conversations are done by voice memo. 

My guess is that they use voice memos because the person on the receiving end can‚Äôt just screenshot like they do with a text. Also, voice memos can be more planned and calculated whereas on a phone call, you have the other person there to immediately respond and you have to deal with confrontation a lot quicker I guess? 


If you‚Äôre saying something shady, it seems less risky than sending a text or video of yourself talking but also less confrontational than being on a phone call."
6738,2020-06-29 08:29:51,hh8xbg,"i know some people talk through voice memos bc it‚Äôs quicker, but i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs all that common. what i‚Äôve been stuck thinking about is 

didn‚Äôt shame himself say that he felt like jepstein was secretly recording him trying to get him to say the n word??? what if this ‚Äúvoice memo‚Äù he has wasn‚Äôt even recorded with the persons consent. obviously jafar wouldn‚Äôt be above it, he‚Äôs sharing it with dozens of people without the victims consent."
6739,2020-06-29 08:27:11,hh8xbg,It's because voice notes delete after the recipient listens to them unless you save them. If you save a voicenote from someone they will know.
6740,2020-06-29 09:32:39,hh8xbg,I have 2 friends who ONLY send voice notes. I laugh when I get a notification because I know it can only be either of them messaging. Someone messaged j* might like them because they disappear if you don't save but for normal ppl they just prefer being able to get their tone across
6741,2020-06-29 08:45:00,hh8xbg,"I‚Äôve had people send me voice memos instead of texts before. Honestly I hate it, I would never send them to people as I find them a little awkward is rather have a text"
6742,2020-06-29 08:45:45,hh8xbg,I purely talk in voice notes to be fair
6743,2020-06-29 09:14:32,hh8xbg,"Yeah I use them too, usually I don't like talking on the phone and I'm also a bit lazy so if I need to say something long I'll send voice notes ha ha"
6744,2020-06-29 08:51:54,hh8xbg,">People are acting like Jafar isn't bothered. He is. He looked unsteady and shakey in the last video he posted, like he's pretending to be fine with what's going on.

I forget to add. I use voice notes to send to my friends when I go on dates. Just so my friends can know I'm okay and If I am in a situation that makes me feel unsafe."
6745,2020-06-29 09:36:22,hh8xbg,There might be some accessibility reason but I‚Äôm just really bad at spelling
6746,2020-06-29 10:31:44,hh8xbg,"i think when he sends them, they are carefully worded to be damaging to be for whoever he's talking about. his voice being recognizable only adds to the ""power"" that he wants to present himself as having, knowing dirt on people. he must've done it with the intention of knowing it will be leaked one day. there's no way someone like him would leave traces otherwise."
6747,2020-06-29 08:27:27,hh8xbg,people generally don't like talking on the phone but are too busy to text sometimes so instead they just use voice memos.
6748,2020-06-29 11:43:47,hh8xbg,I have multiple conversation sin voice memos. This orety normal fro everyone I know. Its easier than typing when your lazy but none of the commitments of a phones call
6749,2020-06-29 08:49:04,hh8xbg,">i know some people talk through voice memos bc it‚Äôs quicker, but i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs all that common. what i‚Äôve been stuck thinking about isdidn‚Äôt shame himself say that he felt like jepstein was secretly recording him trying to get him to say the n word??? what if this ‚Äúvoice memo‚Äù he has wasn‚Äôt even recorded with the persons consent. obviously jafar wouldn‚Äôt be above it, he‚Äôs sharing it with dozens of people without the victims consent.

I use Voice Memo's a lot when I am in public spaces and I am not in the mood to have a back and forth with someone. I usually use it because I have a lot to say and I know someone isn't trying to read all that. It's super convenient. I hate having to type walls of texts. It's not cute."

6758,2020-06-29 09:14:58,hh8xbg,"Omg the response ""Don't be dramatic Gabbie, no one would risk going to jail for you""."
6759,2020-06-29 09:21:52,hh8xbg,"I'm not up on her drama and whatever is on going with her - I remember her and Shanes Cameraman Andrew dating and that's as much of her as I know - but genuinely, she seems like she is going through *something* from seeing drama channels retweeting her and such."
6760,2020-06-29 09:15:17,hh8xbg,She‚Äôs either really going through something right now or she‚Äôs trying to detract from Shane/jeffree/james

6765,2020-06-29 15:50:52,hh8xbg,tomorrow's their weekly podcast... you can listen to it on spotify - Deeper with the Dolan twins. however i doubt they will mention anything...
6766,2020-06-29 15:47:18,hh8xbg,I think it usually is when their new episodes just come out.
6767,2020-06-29 15:58:05,hh8xbg,Well all the awnsers given before but a quick look at twitter and there are also JC fans involved
6768,2020-06-29 00:40:32,hh8xbg,Literally exactly what Tati and J* did last year btw
6769,2020-06-29 00:10:25,hh8xbg,"I have strong reservations about believing anything that came from Jeffree tbh, especially considering he's trying to cover the tracks of his own past predatory and possibly highly illegal behavior"
6770,2020-06-29 01:00:51,hh8xbg,People love the chance to wield homophobic stereotypes against gay men. This is still true regardless of how much James' public image has improved since last year.
6771,2020-06-29 00:16:34,hh8xbg,I haven‚Äôt seen much of that here. Everyone seems skeptical from what I can tell.
6772,2020-06-29 00:07:47,hh8xbg,Most people didn't honestly. Most people not going to believe what known liars have to say without any proof. We learned our lesson last year
6773,2020-06-29 00:06:44,hh8xbg,Especially when it is on brand 100% for Blaire White to cast the rest of the lgbtq + as freaks who are a threat to nice conservative straight boys.
6774,2020-06-29 00:10:05,hh8xbg,I have seen hardly ANY comments like that... nearly all of the ones I‚Äôve seen say they‚Äôre not believing anything they say until there‚Äôs proof now.
6775,2020-06-29 00:07:47,hh8xbg,"Exactly! Aaaaaaand JS also said when presenting the voice clip that he's not even sure if it's true. These are all LIARS. Each and every single one, trying to suddenly pull in James Charles to this circle of bullshit to, in my opinion, try and pull heat away from JS because I honestly don't think any of them give af about Shane Dawson."
6776,2020-06-29 00:11:23,hh8xbg,I really wish that I could see these comments that you guys are apparently addressing because all I see is comments saying the opposite tbh. I think I've seen about two comments saying anything about JC.
6777,2020-06-29 00:13:09,hh8xbg,"I know those types of comments aren‚Äôt the majority but they‚Äôre still out there, going from Blaire‚Äôs video. Again, whether or not which things are true, the energy of some of them seems like these people really want James to be a molester."
6778,2020-06-29 01:08:10,hh8xbg,"For me, its a RUMOR but I will not support any of these people going forward, James included.

These youtubers have gone to far.
So many people are involved.
This is worst then high school drama.

Until someone comes out with concrete proof, I'm done.

I am a parent and I do not condone any of this behavior and won't support it.

And PS I included James because he *has* to know what is being passed around behind his back and should have proof if such rumors are false.
Same way Justin Beiber provided proof to shut that shit down!
And he can't be sued for defamation because its his name that's being dragged."
6779,2020-06-29 09:24:30,hh8xbg,">Qaadir Howard be uploaded this video awhile ago but it's pretty interestinghttps://youtu.be/o9LuGd8-vNEHe doesn't name names but talks about the YouTube beauty industry and his take on it. It seems very obvious that he is talking about Shane Dawson being involved in this too.

I would love for Qaadir to come out and talk. Qaadir broke away from Shane YEARS ago."
6780,2020-06-28 09:12:51,hh8xbg,Coz y‚Äôall can‚Äôt keep quiet and are constantly commenting üòÇ

Is that your channel?"
6785,2020-06-28 23:57:35,hh8xbg,This is the drama equivalent to being camping while COVID started to take off! Get comfortable and watch some Pete Monn there is just too much!
6786,2020-06-28 23:54:44,hh8xbg,Get some food ready and head over to Peter Monns channel and watch all the videos for the past 8 days. That's probably the quickest but most thorough way to get caught up I think
6787,2020-06-29 00:13:24,hh8xbg,"I also recommend Kerry the nosey hausfrau, Petty Paige, and Sanders Kennedy. 

I apologise for incorrect spellings, I‚Äôm so tired."
6788,2020-06-29 23:47:48,hh8xbg,Ugh idk he‚Äôs a panty dropper but all this makes him complicit ü§¢
6789,2020-06-30 01:54:17,hh8xbg,"I think he's an employee but I also think jingleheimer schmitt and shart are two charismatic ppl and it was really easy for him to get sucked into the hype. He wasn't there for the early rough awfulness buy we've seen him get caught up and be like ""gasp, no wait,  omg, I just thought of something,  do you think____ is why ________ happened? ""  then shart gasps and tells Omg WtF and jingleheimer schmitt nods like he knows all the things.  so, i'm kind of waiting to see what he chooses to do next.  If I were him,  i'd cash all the paychecks,  sell the tracksuits and try and slip back behind the camera.

Edit: idk why the downvotes, I was saying he's not squeaky clean but he also was in a shit position bc of his boss, and lets be honest Shart and Jingleheimer are prob charasmatic af. If he comes out defending both of them that will speak volumes vs keeping his head down and moving on to hopefully less problematic asshats"
6790,2020-06-28 17:16:51,hh8xbg,"I see this as her trying to play devil's advocate while still pointing fingers at JC, with NO PROOF. Just her words that that receipt: A. exist, and B. is credible."
6791,2020-06-28 07:58:19,hh8xbg,"I hope he doesn‚Äôt. He set himself up for it. He said in his video that his career should‚Äôve been over a long time ago so if it‚Äôs over, he admits that it‚Äôs what should be done."

also not directed toward you, but want to put it out there for others: just because ppl acknowledge onion boy got one (1) take right, doesn‚Äôt mean those same ppl think onion boy is redeemed/all-knowing/etc

6796,2020-06-28 09:11:02,hh8xbg,Why not give credit to others who‚Äôve been against him instead of Gurgle?

6799,2020-06-28 18:39:06,hh8xbg,Agreed. This should be seriously investigated. Right now a large amount of people are still just treating it as drama and not the predatory serious shit that it involves.

6801,2020-06-29 15:50:49,hh8xbg,"Huh. Yeah, either throwing some pretty direct shade or indirectly defending him. I'm going to go with the former, though, given his other comments. 

I sure hope so lol. It really does read like pretty clear shade at Shane/J*."
6802,2020-06-28 05:37:45,hh8xbg,I‚Äôd assume she‚Äôs going to go after Jeffree and defend Shane

6809,2020-06-28 17:28:16,hh8xbg,"I believe that Blaire did in fact hear the voice memo, because there are many others that said they did too (Petty Paige, Ashlye Kyle etc). What we do not know though if the memo is real or legit. That's why people need to come forth and stop playing us for their own gain"
6810,2020-06-28 17:37:03,hh8xbg,"The voice memo might well be real, but I wanna know how J\* obtained the voice memo. I somehow doubt THAT victim would ever send that in a voice memo to anyone, least of all Jeffree Star?! We have no idea if this is legit, and we'll never know until that victim comes forward with the truth."
6811,2020-06-28 17:27:21,hh8xbg,No. Accusations without receipts are rumors. Rumors are not facts.
6812,2020-06-28 17:29:15,hh8xbg,"I don't believe the J*. The voice memo is not hard enough proof to call James a rapist. Especially what we know about Dramageddon 2 this is all watered down. .

Either way J* is a POS for flaunting that memo around like ""Ha ha ha ha look what I got"". I imagine him cuddling with that voice memo like Jennifer Connelly's character at the end of Requiem for a Dream"
6813,2020-06-28 17:30:52,hh8xbg,"I'm having a difficult time believing the voice memo is real or connected to james charles, but it also depends on what is said? like does the victim explicitly call out james or did j\* just spin it to seem that way. also its gross to hold someones confession of being assaulted in your phone like a weapon. 

we don't have a right to hear the voice memo unless the victim decides to share it themselves. 

but if all this is true, can these people just go to the police and stop playing games?? for the love of god"
6814,2020-06-28 17:29:04,hh8xbg,"She said Jeffree is gross and that he has dirt on everyone. This really isn't any new information. This might be a little conspiracy theory esque but I wouldn't be totally shocked if Jeffree orchestrated this. 

Throw in some negatives about him to make it sound credible but ultimately the person being *exposed* is James Charles all over again."
6815,2020-06-28 17:28:19,hh8xbg,"> but the voice memo was fabricated

Blaire said she spoke with the alleged victim directly, so it's either Blaire's lying or the alleged victim is lying. I don't see why Blaire would lie in this situation, so I feel inclined to believe her at this point."
6816,2020-06-28 17:30:27,hh8xbg,"She has no credibility, in my humble opinion.

However; I believe survivors, and if someone does come out against James, I‚Äôll give them the same benefit of the doubt I give anyone else.

EDIT: also, interesting that no one wants to put the victim on blast, but they have no qualms about sending this supposed voice memo to everyone and their brother in the YT world. Color me skeptical."
6817,2020-06-28 17:29:08,hh8xbg,"Blaire doesn't really have a reason to lie. She was already safe and isolated away from all this drama. Why would she insert herself with a lie? I find her video really credible. It all makes sense.  J* probably shared the audio clip with  Tati,  and encouraged her to make a video."
6818,2020-06-28 17:28:51,hh8xbg,I believe her about 85%. It‚Äôs hard to believe completely without receipts but I also think that receipts would invade the privacy of someone who doesn‚Äôt want to talk yet.
6819,2020-06-28 17:27:23,hh8xbg,ü§° we need to hear the infamous voice memo before we make a decision I think
6820,2020-06-28 17:30:03,hh8xbg,This is just J\* trying to get more people to fall on their sword for him. I don't buy it for a second.
6821,2020-06-28 17:35:14,hh8xbg,I do believe the story is at least to an extent true. This story doesn't have one villain and one good guy. This is a story where everyone involved is a despicable excuse for a human being.
6822,2020-06-28 17:30:07,hh8xbg,"Honestly. I need a bit of time to process after that video. Up until now everyone was sort of cool with James because he said things were misconstrued and consensual. But now Blaire is saying that he has molested someone. I wish she went more into detail about how she decided the voice memos were credible. Man idk. 

Her video is going to put more heat of Jeffree now. But James too. We really starting world word tea all over again."

6825,2020-06-28 18:47:59,hh8xbg,I‚Äôve never heard of her before and am watching the video now. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but she‚Äôs obviously monetizing this because she‚Äôs bleeping our words like ‚Äúrape‚Äù and ‚Äúpredator.‚Äù  Correct? That‚Äôs grimy.
6826,2020-06-28 19:49:59,hh8xbg,"IF there is a victim, you yourself said they don't want to come forward. The kindest thing we could do would be to not speculate on ANY ASPECT and focus on the issues at hand.  

Speculating on IF a victim exsists does many things but mainly, 1) prob stress them the fuck out that at any moment they would be named and 2) take away momentum and create doubt about holding someone responsible for the awful things we have proof that they have done."
6827,2020-06-28 19:40:51,hh8xbg,I know. I hope that it is a lie just because I don't want there to be a victim who must be going through a lot right now.
6828,2020-06-28 19:54:30,hh8xbg,wouldn‚Äôt call BW saying she‚Äôs heard a memo proof. pls let‚Äôs not start dragging this poor boys name through the mud again without ACTUAL proof
6829,2020-06-28 19:56:28,hh8xbg,"I think the general consensus is that until somebody speaks out, we should treat it as unverified and it should not be assumed it‚Äôs true. If the victim doesn‚Äôt want to come forward they likely want people to assume this is not true. They should be able to deal with this as they wish. 

But most of the comments are basically if the victim comes forward they will be believed."
6830,2020-06-28 19:41:37,hh8xbg,This is what I like to call 'being so open minded that your brain falls out.' I don't have time to consider the what-if generated by a third party account of hearing an unverified voice note produced by someone who has already staged one Dramageddon and seeded tea/drama channels with false narratives. Especially when the person carrying that message makes her daily bread by lying about LGBTQ+ people to cishet white dudes.

6834,2020-06-28 21:01:01,hh8xbg,"For real, someone on here tried to be like ""people just dont like her because she leans more right than other youtubers"" like no she actively supports hate."
6835,2020-06-28 22:12:35,hh8xbg,Without a crystal ball has a video up going over what was said. Watch that or some other YouTuber if you want to know what happened. Blaire is one of the last people who deserves views.
6836,2020-06-28 20:57:32,hh8xbg,She hasn‚Äôt worked with either of them in two years and distanced herself with the whole political side of YouTuber. She isn‚Äôt even right wing anymore - she‚Äôs gotten way more left and is in the middle.

6838,2020-06-28 15:44:39,hh8xbg,"Yeah I don‚Äôt think Shane is genuinely an evil person. I also don‚Äôt think he diddled kids. But I do think he was racist, sexist, and used homophobic and extremely offensive ‚Äúhumor‚Äù to try to get views and fame in his earlier days (and even up to a few years ago on the podcast). And even more disturbing, I think that he did some inappropriate things with kids (the willow smith poster, the Omegle thing, the cousin thing) not because he actually likes kids but because he considered it shocking and funny which is disgusting. He needs to actually apologize, donate a large sum to children‚Äôs and related causes, go to therapy, and really take a long hard look at himself."

6847,2020-06-29 01:03:09,hh8xbg,"That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt think he paid Blair off to do this to ‚Äútake away heat from Shane.‚Äù  It still makes him look like a really terrible person.  At this point, we shouldn‚Äôt be focusing on whether or not the memo is genuine but on how shitty J* is for using it as gossip and spreading it around."

6849,2020-06-28 07:59:50,hh8xbg,"I would find it hard to believe he wasn‚Äôt aware. If Shane talked about these things this often in the public eye, there‚Äôs no way he wasn‚Äôt also making these ‚Äújokes‚Äù in his private life."
6850,2020-06-28 08:03:10,hh8xbg,"I‚Äôve honestly never liked Ryland (or his sister) they‚Äôve always looked like very shallow /privileged people to me. 

I‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre bad people, but I don‚Äôt think they really get any of the social issues going on, specially since they‚Äôve been living pretty sheltered lives in sunny Los √Ångeles, basically swimming in Gucci.

I just don‚Äôt find them relatable at all. I used to have a soft spot for Shane, because his personal struggles always resonated with me, but that sympathy is long gone."
6851,2020-06-28 07:39:57,hh8xbg,You seriously think Ryland never watched a single one of Shane's old videos? Because they were all like this. Shock 'humor' was Shane's only thing. Literally nothing being brought up now was hidden or a secret.
6852,2020-06-28 07:50:27,hh8xbg,I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs feeling for his future pockets!  That cash cow is drying up fast
6853,2020-06-28 07:48:24,hh8xbg,"I want to hope for the best, but this one is hard. I don‚Äôt think you can make SO MANY racist and pedophilic statements without it being part of your personal ethos (even if it was years ago). These things come up in smaller, but still overt ways with your closest friends and family. Morgan and Ryland‚Äôs silence right now is especially concerning regarding their complicity. If I suddenly became aware that my fianc√©/BIL had undoubtedly said/did these things I would quickly and loudly condemn them. They‚Äôre either silent because they knew or they‚Äôre silent because they‚Äôre hiring consultants to say the right thing."
6854,2020-06-28 09:26:39,hh8xbg,Well I only hope that rylan doesnt break up with shane. Why? Because shane is in a really bad mental place rigth know and I hate all the bad stuff he has done but I am afraid of him harming himself. I dont jnoe maybe I am too naive but I hope ryland sticks with him. And help him to be better
6855,2020-06-28 18:55:20,hh8xbg,"Fair enough but can we not attack people who are 'carrying water' for her because its starting to become very toxic in this sub if someone dares to have a differing opinion on a person/situation that doesn't fit the main narrative on this sub. If you see someone supporting or defending someone you don't like then either ignore it or be polite and explain your opinion but we can't be nasty and rude to people and expect everyone to think exactly the same as us.

Edit: my main purpose of this comment was to say that we can still be nice and we should still be able to form our own opinion on someone or a situation that doesn't have to be black and white. Bullying, harassing or attacking someone into conforming to your way of thinking is not going to work and is certainly not what I thought this sub was about."

Also that he is scary and has dirt on everyone. No names were given because it‚Äôs not Blairs story to tell.  

Can someone add more?

Edit: OH and Shame was addressed. Blair said she feels torn because she has a loyalty to Shame but she does not condone the things that has come out recently."

6864,2020-06-28 21:06:14,hh8xbg,"I don‚Äôt have a link, but I did watch it. 
Blaire talks about a FaceTime call between her and Jeffree where Jeffree played a voice memo for her. This voice memo is the evidence that Jeffree has been claiming he had all this time but never disclosed; he recently talked about it on a podcast and said he‚Äôd show it to the podcast members in the other room. Blaire says the voice memo comes from a ‚Äúprominent YouTuber‚Äù, whose identity hasn‚Äôt been revealed. The YouTuber claims that James sexually molested him, and Blaire says (in reference to their claims) ‚Äúit‚Äôs credible‚Äù. Blaire did not play the voice memo or reveal any private information about the YouTuber; she says it‚Äôs their story to tell, so it‚Äôs not her place to out them. But she wanted to publicly address the claims since people deserve to know if there‚Äôs evidence that James is a predator, and she criticizes Jeffree for sitting on this evidence for so long while simultaneously ‚Äúouting‚Äù this YouTuber to other people behind the scenes.

TL;DR Jeffree has a voice memo of another YouTuber claiming that James sexually molested them"

6877,2020-06-28 19:43:28,hh8xbg,I‚Äôm all for Trisha bashing the vlog squad but there has been years of horrible proven behavior with victims coming forward. While no proof has come out about James beside jafar saying he has a voice memo.
6878,2020-06-28 19:28:18,hh8xbg,I haven't seen any evidence of James Charles being anything other than a dramatic and slightly annoying upstart challenging J*'s position in the beauty industry.
6879,2020-06-28 19:30:56,hh8xbg,"Great! Then I'm sure you wouldn't mind if we continue criticizing J\* and Shane for a little while, right? Since they've done bad things, too."
6880,2020-06-28 17:46:36,hh8xbg,"No one can really say and explicitly accuse James because with no solid proof (which voice memo is not) there is a lawsuit in the making very fast. This is why everyone is a ""rat in a cage"" as Tati put it."

some gems from the compilation: ""Black lives matter? still trash"""
6888,2020-06-28 15:05:38,hh8xbg,I don't think she left because of her past videos. She was already planning to leave and decided to address her problematic past videos before leaving to avoid controversy.
6889,2020-06-28 14:54:30,hh8xbg,"It seems she wanted to leave YouTube for a while now. I think it showed around the time she started doing the 32-year-old lady does what she wants content. But it sort of backfired because more people subbed to her. She doesn't always monetize her videos anyway, so she must be set for life."
6890,2020-06-28 14:55:05,hh8xbg,I think people were right when they say she was looking for an out. I loved her content as well but I could see it too that it was taking its toll on her. She‚Äôs got the money to support herself so she‚Äôll be fine. I will very very much miss seeing her dogs every week though.
6891,2020-06-28 13:00:56,hh8xbg,"Apologies on their own mean nothing imo. How can you apologize for acting racist for example, all while making vast production docu series excusing the actions of other racist people?  That's beyond hypocritical. How can i ever believe that Shane was sorry for what he did, when he is the main reason that J\* got the forgiveness he never really worked towards, after years and years of deplorable behavior. Not buying it for a second.  


Also Shane was racist towards Asian people/Latinos etc too. Racist overall"
6892,2020-06-28 13:19:06,hh8xbg,Shane has made horrible remarks/jokes about Asian and trans people. Are they not allowed an opinion as well?
6893,2020-06-29 18:31:21,hh8xbg,"The stans over at the Shane sub seem to have downloaded some of them so they should resurface. But honestly, I think we've seen enough."

6895,2020-06-29 19:36:18,hh8xbg,All of it already exists out there. I believe the worst stuff has already been found.
6896,2020-06-29 21:30:58,hh8xbg,I remember that I stopped watching him after he made some gross jokes about Trayvon Martin and it kinda clicked that he wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúplaying a character‚Äù. I was super young so maybe I dreamt it or something but I don‚Äôt think that clip has been posted anywhere. I think it was a Skittles commercial skit or some garbage like that?? Idk?

6902,2020-06-28 11:42:35,hh8xbg,Shane had showed that he's continued to surround himself and efend problematic people which is why his past was dug up to begin with. Jenna was also only dragged because eof her association with Shane.
6903,2020-06-28 12:04:21,hh8xbg,"Jenna marbles wasn‚Äôt targeted, I think she knew she had some semi offensive content on her channel in the past and did damage control before people started to address it. YouTube definitely was a different place 10 years ago but to keep the hateful content up and monetized on your channel is a bad move. Shane was one of the only youtubers I knew of 10 years ago so there‚Äôs probably others that have put out ‚Äúdark humor‚Äù content, but jeez was his stuff bad."
6904,2020-06-28 13:24:42,hh8xbg,"What I don‚Äôt get is if he knew those behaviors were offensive, regretful and ‚Äúnot who I am‚Äù, why did he leave them up on his channels until yesterday? Why weren‚Äôt they taken down when he allegedly realized they were awful? I was never into Shane so I don‚Äôt know this for sure, but others have said Shane has apologized previously for his offensive behavior. Why didn‚Äôt the videos come down then? So he apologized before but still had these videos up and monetized until *yesterday* ? All that shows is hurting people < money."
6905,2020-06-28 11:46:49,hh8xbg,"I agree it‚Äôs weird how people are picking and choosing who to cancel. Some people keep getting a pass while others are actually targeted. 

Shane absolutely deserves it though."
6906,2020-06-28 13:53:11,hh8xbg,no one was targeting jenna she CHOSE to put that video up. stop victimizing white women please
6907,2020-06-29 02:24:37,hh8xbg,"I wouldn‚Äôt feel too angry, most of her stans agree Jenna has been looking for an out for a long time and decided to capitalize on the moment. She was probably going to bow out this year"
6908,2020-06-29 02:24:01,hh8xbg,"Jenna didn't have to ""leave the internet"". She chose to retire from one revenue stream that she seemed to not enjoy much anymore and get in front of a possible scandal. I hope it was genuine and about her growing, but this was also a great move for her career."
6909,2020-06-29 02:39:18,hh8xbg,"Jenna was not run off the internet. Chescaleigh however, was, so feel free to be angry on her behalf."
6910,2020-06-29 02:28:41,hh8xbg,"Definitely feel it was her way, of distancing herself from the situation. She probably knew about the shitstorm that was about to ensue. Plus I don't feel like her heart was in it anymore, and this was her out. Does it suck, it does. But I am hoping in some roundabout way Jaffa will not be on top."
6911,2020-06-29 02:13:29,hh8xbg,"Jenna was/is friends with Shane and J\*. Maybe she knew this was coming and bowed out to get in front of it before folks started coming at her to denounce them. She gets out with clean hands, and Shane gets dragged for piggybacking off her exit post. Honestly, she's outplayed them all."
6912,2020-06-29 02:56:01,hh8xbg,He‚Äôs Goliath so it‚Äôll take more time to slay
6913,2020-06-29 02:18:51,hh8xbg,It‚Äôs because Jenna is a good person and wants to grow and put out good content. While we might not think she needed to take a step back she definitely felt it was needed.
6914,2020-06-28 19:13:54,hh8xbg,"Possible,"

He very much seemed like he was taking the allegations lying down, and *apologizing* for them. I get that he probably felt pressured to respond and apologize simply because so many people were angry at him, but did he ever talk about why he made that initial response looking very guilty and sad, and then did a 180 and came out guns blazing in defense of himself?"

6930,2020-06-29 15:41:41,hh8xbg,I don't think that they are affiliated with Killer merch. On Killer merch instagram there is no photos of them and their merch.
6931,2020-06-29 15:33:00,hh8xbg,"Does anyone have a screen shot showing that they were Killer Merch partners? I don't remember seeing them listed on the website, and I just googled their merch and they still have a merch site up (idk if it's an old merch store or not. It does have a COVID-19 notice at the top, so it's been updated at least since March of this year. It doesn't seem to be affiliated with Killer Merch though)"
6932,2020-06-29 15:35:47,hh8xbg,I tried to look up an archive of the partners page to confirm if the Dolan's were ever listed as partners but Web Archive didn't have a snapshot.

6936,2020-06-28 18:45:50,hh8xbg,She also mentioned that there is another youtuber who is actually a r*pist
6937,2020-06-28 19:15:40,hh8xbg,"Tdlr of blaire‚Äôs video:

She starts of by saying that she was scared to release the video, but decided to go ahead as it was ‚Äúthe right thing to do‚Äù Claims to have been told things by J that made her feel complicit to his actions

Verifies that she has never met J, but facetimed him twice

She explains that when she was making a video on Dahvie Vanity, J called her and manipulated her into not releasing the vid. She agreed to not release it.

When she saw J on the Chris Hansen podcast ‚Äúclearing‚Äù his name, she realized he lied and dropped the video

On the facetime when J was manipulative, she claims that J told her that James Charles raped a well known youtuber and he provided a voice memo proving it. Blaire feels that it is not her place to release the memo, but urges the victim to speak up.

She claims J told her that another well known youtuber raped someone, but while J provided no evidence, she believes it is ‚Äúbelievable‚Äù

She finishes by saying she doesn‚Äôt condone shanes jokes, amd that she just discovered everything like the rest of us.

To conclude, she provided no receipts, but i think not releasing the voice memo is understandable if its true

She says that keemstar probs has heard the voice memo as J is alleged to have played it to him before an interview

Edit: words"
6938,2020-06-28 18:40:40,hh8xbg,Probably shouldn‚Äôt speak on it if you won‚Äôt even watch the video
6939,2020-06-28 19:23:05,hh8xbg,"I agree with u/YuGiOhNoSheBettaDont (great name); if you refuse to watch the video, don‚Äôt speak on it.

She hardly mentions JC, aside from the circumstances of the voice memo. The video is almost entirely about J*, how he manipulates people, and her feelings regarding that. Then there‚Äôs a section at the end touching on the Shame allegations."
6940,2020-06-28 18:44:46,hh8xbg,Yeah this just isn‚Äôt what happened
6941,2020-06-28 17:23:37,hh8xbg,It didn't take anything. We all witnessed him doing exactly that on Faze's podcast last month.
6942,2020-06-28 17:21:50,hh8xbg,She's a white supremacist...
6943,2020-06-29 23:30:03,hh8xbg,Business partners are typical esp for folks who haven‚Äôt run a business of that nature before. It helps them get loans and other preferential treatment if a scumbag like J ‚≠êÔ∏èhas someone there to legitimize him. And you can still be self made if you seek VC funds to startup.

6945,2020-06-29 23:28:14,hh8xbg,"He still fits the discription of selfmade, it‚Äôs not his families money that helped him to get rich"
6946,2020-06-29 23:44:46,hh8xbg,I have my feelings about Jeffree but we can't discredit his success with reaches.
6947,2020-06-28 13:05:24,hh8xbg,"I'm not sure she even has a schedule tbh. Her uploads seem a bit random to me, but i'm not a fan and i'm not following her all that much. It seems however that she uploads whenever she has stuff to talk about? idk"
6948,2020-06-28 16:55:06,hh8xbg,"Not sure what timezone you're in but she tweeted she'd upload it in 2 hours, and that was nearly two hours ago now. So soon."
6949,2020-06-29 10:38:50,hh8xbg,"Spillsesh does a good summary. Basically last year J* claimed he had evidence JC was a predator but backed down saying he'd made a mistake when asked to present evidence. Now he's banding around his memo to anyone who'll listen, which coincides with JC nearing 20mil subscribers ...   
Blair's said he made her listen to it, but its not hers to spread if it's real. In summary J* is still trying to take down JC via manipulation of drama commentary people."
6950,2020-06-29 10:37:22,hh8xbg,"Voice note apparently suggesting that JC committed some sort of sexual assault has has its existence confirmed by blaire white, however she gave no receipts and she‚Äôs also friends with Shane"
6951,2020-06-29 12:01:51,hh8xbg,"As a side note to add on to what others have said: as of now I believe we only have two people who have confirmed that they have heard the voice memo. Jeffree Star and Blaire white. People have been speculating about who has heard it and who hasn‚Äôt, but as far as I can see it‚Äôs just those two who have said they heard the note. Everyone else has only heard of the voice note and that others may have listened to it. 

Also there‚Äôs slight inconsistencies between what j* said and what Blaire said. Blaire made it sound as though the voice memo was of the victim speaking directly. J* makes it sound as though the memo is someone else talking about what james did to someone else. 

Basically the whole thing is kinda fishy and sus and feels like a major distraction tactic to derail anyone looking in to Shane or j* at this point"
6952,2020-06-28 19:00:46,hh8xbg,Another awful friend of Shane's. Shocker.
6953,2020-06-28 17:42:50,hh8xbg,"Yes yes we‚Äôre all aware but the focus here is Jeffree Star blackmailing people with information on sexual predation.

Y‚Äôall can go after Blaire next week but for right now babe let‚Äôs not let our ADHD distract us."
6954,2020-06-28 17:43:35,hh8xbg,I‚Äôd be more inclined to accept what was written on there if it wasn‚Äôt so horrendously one sided and biased. People you don‚Äôt agree with politically aren‚Äôt necessarily bad people and can still do good things whether you agree with their opinion or you don‚Äôt.

6957,2020-06-29 15:06:24,hh8xbg,"The alleged victim never responded to Blaire, so as much as I am a fan of hers, I think it was incredibly damaging of her to say the voice memo was ""credible"". Yet again, James is being accused of horrific crimes with no proof.

I think Blaire done exactly what Jeffree wanted, he knew she'd speak up about the information and it's so huge, it takes the heat off of him and Shane.

I just think everyone should be innocent until proven guilty. 

Also, J* himself said he's not even sure the voice note is real (think it was while on Keem's podcast?)"
6958,2020-06-28 20:13:58,hh8xbg,You're known by the company you keep. Morgan and Ryland have been more than happy to be associated with Shane in the good times. They're going to get splattered in the blowback for not standing up to him when he erred.

6976,2020-06-29 13:49:02,hh8xbg,"She said it was ""credible"" which suggests that she heard the account and believed it was truthful at face value."
6977,2020-06-29 15:02:30,hh8xbg,"That's a really interesting observation. Personally I think her saying it's ""credible"" is quite a risk and a big assumption to make. Nowerdays there's literally software that can create a voice message mimicking a certain person's voice. Shane even featured it in one of his conspiracy videos.

I just feel like it's not correct for her to say something like that is ""credible"" since so many things are probably going on behind the scenes that Blaire doesn't know about."
6978,2020-06-29 12:01:02,hh8xbg,Amazing!

6980,2020-06-29 00:32:29,hh8xbg,"This is jeffree star where talking about. The chances of him just paying a youtuber to make that memo is very high. Also a voice memo!! That is not enough to evidence to accuse someone of something that serious. Blaire as a SA victim should know that. The internet is a f‚Äôed up place! I cant believe anyone on there without evidence, and the fact that Jeffree star is involved, and the oh so convenient timing of him messaging blaire. This is definitely a scheme to get everyone off his back and to get attention onto James, and Blaire just did that for him. She literally just did his dirty work. He‚Äôs still manipulating her and she doesn‚Äôt even know it."
6981,2020-06-29 00:15:13,hh8xbg,There is no victim. There is only a rumor.
6982,2020-06-29 00:49:34,hh8xbg,"You say you're pretty neutral on her, but I hope you take a minute to learn more about Blaire's racism and transphobia. She peddles really dangerous ideas."

6984,2020-06-29 01:51:31,hh8xbg,Fun fact: Blaire White actually took part in a video just a few months ago where they had two sides: pro Me Too movement and against it. She was AGAINST it. So how can we trust her in this?
6985,2020-06-29 08:07:45,hh8xbg,"Voice memo might be fake, creepshow said keem never heard it, if faze hasn't either i wouldn't believe it existed when he went on mom's basement if he was over here showing Blair so fast and shane never brought one up when he was talking about James"
6986,2020-06-29 13:55:04,hh8xbg,Did I watch a different video? That's exactly what she said.
6987,2020-06-29 13:50:09,hh8xbg,"Blaire mentions in the video she thinks it would be wrong for anyone but the victim to go to the police about this, and I agree."
6988,2020-06-28 17:22:37,hh8xbg,I hate this notion that the whole beauty community is toxic- if it‚Äôs perceived that way that‚Äôs on us as consumers for spotlighting toxic people and disregarding the unproblematic and smaller creators.  A bunch of evil men are not representative of the BEAUTY community as a whole
6989,2020-06-28 17:22:34,hh8xbg,"I don't not agree, but we knew all of this information. Of course Blaire's video is credible, J\* already said all of this on Faze banks' podcast. He literally said this same exact thing. Like we literally witnessed effectively the convo he had w. Blaire because he had the same convo w. Faze. 

I'm still confused as to the scope of the memo. Is the voice memo done by the \[alleged\] victim?"
6990,2020-06-29 05:44:51,hh8xbg,"I haven‚Äôt supported Shane since the Jake Paul series and had only followed him a year or two prior, but the people relishing in his downfall makes me uncomfortable. I understand wanting people to be held accountable, but laughing at someone as they fall and sending hateful messages/threats to them just feels like bad energy that‚Äôs going to come back to you in one way or the other. This whole situation just feels incredibly sad to me, on all sides."
6991,2020-06-29 05:27:05,hh8xbg,Same. I hope he is staying offline for his own mental health.
6992,2020-06-29 05:32:30,hh8xbg,Oh come on. He is an adult. He can take care of himself. He is so wealthy that he has unlimited resources to get help. He‚Äôs not some dude on the street with no access to mental health help. He‚Äôs made everyone so scared to call him out. It‚Äôs been compared to a partner threatening suicide if you leave them.
6993,2020-06-29 05:31:13,hh8xbg,"Same here. I do feel like he will try to hurt himself in some way. I know he has a good support system but it's a lot to have thrown at you at once.

He deserves to be held accountable, though."
6994,2020-06-29 05:29:57,hh8xbg,I was thinking the same thing and was a little surprised it hadn't been brought up yet. I'm hoping he has enough familial support to get through this in a healthy way
6995,2020-06-28 19:35:11,hh8xbg,I actually doubt that. He comes across as an attention seeker who wants to look like he knows stuff.
6996,2020-06-28 19:53:21,hh8xbg,"He is so susceptible to manipulation whatever he ""knows"" is always someone's agenda"
6997,2020-06-28 19:35:40,hh8xbg,"I don‚Äôt know that at all.

7021,2020-06-29 02:00:13,hh8xbg,"No. They think they‚Äôre invincible. They thought they could manipulate their audience (which they did for months), get a big check and peace out (which they did) without any repercussions."
7022,2020-06-29 02:04:50,hh8xbg,"Neither of them thinks they warrant cancellation, though, or could be cancelled, so no, I don't think so.

I actually think Shane will eventually come back from this.  And if Jeffree can ride this out without a knockout punch coming (like has been promised every day for awhile now), he will be fine, too.

People have short memories, and love a comeback story."

7043,2020-06-29 04:04:24,hh8xbg,"Someone finally said it.

All of this is TEXTBOOK Cancer and Scorpio.

Shane is a Cancer decan 3 (Cancer Pisces) which makes him more prone to lying and speaking out of turn when he's mad or upset. Even people claiming that his apology was manipulative - this is a Cancer thing (and I'm a Cancer). To a Cancer, it wasn't manipulative behavior, it's seen as covering all the bases (saying he deserves to be canceled). Even saying that Jeffree is still family - Cancers have the most annoying loyalty complex, and it can only be severed when a Cancer is at the very end of their rope. Because Jeffree has done so much for him, Shane can't help but still have some type of loyalty towards him.

Jeffree, as a Scorpio man, is doing exactly what I expected him to do. He took a hint of tea against James and BLEW IT UP. I've had two male Scorpio friends do the exact same thing to me, and it took my Libra friend to actually argue back in my defense to get it all to stop. Scorpios don't need rhyme or reason to gather tea and suddenly use it in their favor, but the moment someone refutes it or doesn't back them up, they go silent. Scorpio males would rather go silent and pretend like it didn't happen than apologize. They hate to admit how ""sensitive"" they are, and gathering information they can use to combat others is basically their defense mechanism. It's like how every girl can pull up receipts from day 1, Scorpio men do it, too. It's the stupidest defense mechanism all for the sake of protecting their own emotions which they misread 90% of the time.

The friendship alone is unfortunate. Scorpio has a different kind of intense energy that can easily influence a Cancer. Cancers rely so much on validation and family-like ties that they are easily influenced by the opinions of their friends.

Thank you for opening this up, I've wanted to rant about this for ages LOL"

‚ÄòJ Star sent me a voice memo about a YouTuber who claims JC raped him, but I won‚Äôt provide any other details‚Äô is not proof and it doesn‚Äôt help the victim. It‚Äôs a vague, accusatory rumor designed to take the pressure off Jeff and further muddy James‚Äôs reputation in a way that can‚Äôt be easily dismissed.

7099,2020-06-28 21:50:46,hh8xbg,James was (and still is) the only one who provided actual proof.
7100,2020-06-28 21:30:30,hh8xbg,"Because the rumours originated from Tati's allegations that were later proven to be purposefully misrepresentated. 

The only people who have accused James of sexual harassment are Jeffree and Tati, on the behalf of a consenting partner and now an anonymous person.  Outside of this, no victim has ever come forward against James. There is zero credible basis to these claims, and are soley based off of the words of two people who have shown they are willing to stretch the truth or lie on this matter."

Jeffree had been claiming to have this evidence got a while now and has more than enough opportunities to put up or shut up but he's refused. 

If there is a victim, I personally doubt that it's in connection with the JC/TW/J* situation."

7103,2020-06-28 21:53:52,hh8xbg,"Because people are innocent until proven guilty? And also, because as far as we know, there is \_no\_ victim. No one came forward saying ""JC did this to me"". All we have is hearsay from two people (Jeffree and Tati, and I guess now Blair). Jeffree flip-flops on whether he stands by it or not, but Tati seems to have admitted that her accusations were a mistake (as did Shane). Blair's statement is confusing - she claims she saw a voice memo that seemed believable, but she also claims Jeffree was manipulating her. There's literally nothing that leads us to believe he did anything."

Her most popular videos are transformations and the intent is never to target a race or create a stereotype, but to look as close to whoever she's trying to look like, i see it as a form of art personally. Her skin color is very close to the Drake look anyways, i don't think she tried to look darker, she's not pale her self.  


As for Michelle, i think it's borderline offensive, might be cause the make up it self looks terrible and Aaliyah was a queen! She could have tried to recreate the look without trying to look darker, i find that tacky."

The beauty gurus making money put a lot of time into their videos (or did before they grew a following, at the very least). I know it's cool and edgy to imply that making videos and applying make up aren't real jobs, but they absolutely are. 

>Dear Internet, teens and 20-35 year olds

So... everyone, then. You're asking everyone, including yourself, to not prop up horrible people. That's valid, but the holier-than-thou act when you're on a drama thread with everyone else is a bit much. 

>simply because you've developed a bizarre parasocial relationship with them. They're not your friend.

So the thing that marketers have been pushing for decades? The one that isn't new *at all* and that most people over the age of 18 fully understand? The one that exists in pretty much every industry? Got it. 

There should absolutely be personal responsibility regarding who you support and who you don't - again, that's 100% valid. But this post is not it."

She starts of by saying that she was scared to release the video, but decided to go ahead as it was ‚Äúthe right thing to do‚Äù Claims to have been told things by J that made her feel complicit to his actions

Verifies that she has never met J, but facetimed him twice

She explains that when she was making a video on Dahvie Vanity, J called her and manipulated her into not releasing the vid. She agreed to not release it.

When she saw J on the Chris Hansen podcast ‚Äúclearing‚Äù his name, she realized he lied and dropped the video

On the facetime when J was manipulative, she claims that J told her that James Charles raped a well known youtuber and he provided a voice memo proving it. Blaire feels that it is not her place to release the memo, but urges the victim to speak up.

She claims J told her that another well known youtuber raped someone, but while J provided no evidence, she believes it is ‚Äúbelievable‚Äù

She finishes by saying she doesn‚Äôt condone shanes jokes, amd that she just discovered everything like the rest of us.

To conclude, she provided no receipts, but i think not releasing the voice memo is understandable if its true

She says that keemstar probs has heard the voice memo as J is alleged to have played it to him before an interview

7194,2020-06-28 22:54:18,hh8xbg,You're absolutely right. This is beyond drama and tea right now.
7195,2020-06-28 16:23:12,hh8xbg,"I think this has been asked several times but I‚Äôll try to be brief when recapping my thoughts:

He can‚Äôt. We can not dictate who decides to forgive him and who doesnt. It‚Äôs up to individual people to decide and at this point? If the smiths aren‚Äôt accepting his apology then I don‚Äôt think he can make things right. 

If we give him some leeway though?

I would say he needs to remove himself from the platform- all of his platforms for the foreseeable future. No huge apology statement just ‚Äúmy content hurt people. I used my image as my brand and that is still hurting people. I need to remove myself from this equation‚Äù

And then he needs to go to get some serious therapy so he can develop the tools to self reflect, learn to come to terms with his trauma, and realize that the fact that he has past trauma doesn‚Äôt excuse his actions. And like honestly? He needs at least two different types of therapy programs to help him develop coping mechanisms and learn how to handle his intense emotional swings (I only say this because he has said he has adhd and that‚Äôs a fairly large trait that can be the most disruptive to social situations). 

And after that? Maybe he can come back with a clearer head and better tool sets to articulate how he messed up. But that is years of therapy right there. That is some intense long term weekly sessions. And who knows if he can make that commitment. 

And even if he did all of those steps?

I‚Äôm not sure he could still make this right. If people chose to not forgive him? I wouldn‚Äôt blame them. 

So. My answer is ‚Äúprobably almost nothing and even if he did the hard work it doesn‚Äôt matter. He did some awful things and no one is obligated to forgive him‚Äù"
7196,2020-06-28 16:23:05,hh8xbg,"I honestly don't think he can make this right.

1) His jokes about black people and women in particular weren‚Äôt just one offs (not that that‚Äôs okay, either)-it‚Äôs an extensive and growing list.

2) He hasn‚Äôt changed because he‚Äôs friends with J*. 

2a) Also, if you believe Peter Monn, he knew J* still used racist language before he filmed the first series and did it anyway. 

2b) Even if that‚Äôs not true, his continued defense of J* as recently as last week is damning by itself.

3) He made a ton of other jokes about other people of color and other disenfranchised groups. I can‚Äôt accept those apologies but I don‚Äôt buy those, either.

4) The pedophilia jokes are far, far too extensive for me to feel comfortable supporting him even if I believed he wasn‚Äôt racist anymore. At this point I‚Äôm starting to think that he needs to be investigated. Even if it turns up nothing, he‚Äôs exhibited a worrying pattern, and I‚Äôd rather be safe than sorry."

7201,2020-06-28 16:29:19,hh8xbg,"He can't make things right, because forgiveness isn't up to him in the first place.

Also Also Blaire White: Jeffree said someone else was a predator and provided no proof but I totes believe him. Even though I've said he's a bad person and titled this as an expose video while I'm really just validating him and trying to save my own ass."
7210,2020-06-29 09:43:55,hh8xbg,"About a month ago, Blaire tweeted about the Jeffree/Dahvie situation without tagging Jeff. Minutes later, Jeffree was in her DMs asking to FaceTime. She didn‚Äôt screen record the call, but she said Jeffree eventually asked her about her feelings towards James Charles. She assumes he brought this topic up since a year ago she had made a video opposed to Jeffree for accusing James Charles of being a predator without receipts. 

Blaire informs Jeffree of her position that she had maintained since last year‚Äî that Jeffree should not have made a serious allegation against James Charles without providing evidence. Jeffree tells her that‚Äôs fine she feels that way; but, asks if she wants to hear his proof.

Blaire confirms that Jeffree provided her with a voice memo that she believes is the one he alluded to when talking to Faze banks and keemstar. In the memo, a youtuber that she did not name (as it‚Äôs not her story to tell) tells their story of James sexually assaulting them. Blaire reached out to the victim to inform them Jeffree shared that information with her, that she is a rape survivor, she supports them, and thinks it would be good for them to tell their story when they are ready.

Blaire believes Jeffree is a monster for holding this allegation as blackmail against James Charles‚Äî since Jeffree repeatedly brings it up to remind James to not speak badly about him (Jeffree). She also was scared to speak on it since it‚Äôs not her story to tell but she finds it difficult to remain silent with a predator out there. 

The last few minutes is an editing clip where she addresses Jaden and Jada Smith admonishing Shane. She admits she has loyalty to Shane, but she would be a hypocrite to not speak up against his behavior. She said she hopes Shane was just joking, but he went too far.

He hasn‚Äôt promoted ONE person of color on his channel but instead promotes Trisha, Tana and Jeffree who are all racially insensitive individuals. I‚Äôm not angry about his past, I‚Äôm angry about who he has been up until now. He hasn‚Äôt changed he‚Äôs just gotten better at covering his tracks, but not good enough to delete his own videos off his channel that he‚Äôs so ‚Äúashamed of‚Äù. Right... he wasn‚Äôt so ashamed when he was still making money off of them a few days ago.

By the way, when has Shane EVER done anything that has benefitted someone other than himself or his friends? Has he done community service or donated to charity or helped sexually abused children or helped inner city children get out of the situations they are in?"
7239,2020-06-28 13:36:17,hh8xbg,Shingle Diaper showed that he hasn't changed though. His terrible apology letter and even worse video accompanied by who he aligns himself with show that he has in fact not changed.
7240,2020-06-28 13:34:46,hh8xbg,"i sometimes wonder what people think cancelling is when they say ""it's not fair to cancel him"". cancelling started off just meaning ""i am not giving this person my support or my views and i think other people shouldn't either for \[x\] reasons"". most people i've seen are not wishing him financial ruin or isolation, they just want him off youtube because he's shown time and time again that he cannot be trusted with the platform he's amassed and that he amassed it through material that was racist, inappropriate and offensive. he can survive without being on youtube."
7241,2020-06-28 13:39:45,hh8xbg,"Oh won't someone please think of the privileged white man? Let's never forget who the REAL victim is here, this racist, misogynistic, sociopathic piece of shit who was sexually inappropriate with minors and went on a podcast to ""hilariously"" talk about his torture porn fantasy against a woman, but wishing him to lose his money is soooo cruel and sad, he's improved so much and is such a soft boi :3 uwu.

7251,2020-06-29 02:19:18,hh8xbg,"Funny, I got the King of Wands - the ring leader card. üòÇ

Three of wands - Jeffree is committed to his manipulative plans. He‚Äôs definitely aware of the things in his way and he‚Äôs already making calculations to overcome them.

Knight of Swords - dedicated to his mission. There‚Äôs literally a shitstorm forming around the knight and he jumps directly into it lmao. Jeffree is so motivated to overstepping anyone that comes in his way he will stop at nothing to succeed. 

The cards didn‚Äôt come to play üôè"
7252,2020-06-29 02:15:37,hh8xbg,"The Wolf in Blaire's Clothing:  Um...the page of wands is the gossip card and the Moon is the card of illusion and deception. That combination says to me that he is spreading lies.

Shame Dawson:  10 of Cups points to his family or intimate relationships and Ace of Swords indicates a new truth coming to light. The Ace of Swords in this case could also mean mental clarity, meaning he is learning who his real friends are right now.

James Charles:  Ace of Wands indicates renewed enthusiasm, new creative idea and the Temperance card means emotional balance, inner peace and patience. To me, that combination means he is focusing on his creative passions and doing so is keeping him emotionally balanced."
7253,2020-06-29 03:02:44,hh8xbg,">isn't a bad person.

You lost me there....I refuse to believe he is not a bad person.

7271,2020-06-28 19:47:39,hh8xbg,Same exactly I think it influenced the hell out of me when I was 11-13.
7272,2020-06-29 06:32:10,hh8xbg,"I used to do this mentoring scheme with kids who were at risk of going into care, and there was this one kid who watched all the shit you just described but this was last year in 2019. A skinny white 13 year old who said the n word in online gaming and thought if someone was fat they deserved to die. 

He also beat his mum black and blue on the regular and our mentoring had to be cut short because of reccuring boundary issues and my own safety. 

Oh he was also a MASSIVE 69 fan. The rainbow rapper paedo guy."
7273,2020-06-29 18:39:51,hh8xbg,"I‚Äôm in my mid twenties, so when I first started watching stuff on YouTube it was peak smosh and the key of awesome. Shane Dawson tv was one of the popular and recommended things at the time, the first video of his I ever watched he was making all these sexual possibly incest jokes about Hannah Montana. Surely no one ever actually thought that was funny? Like even at like 13-14 I was like, this ain‚Äôt it."
7274,2020-06-29 19:16:22,hh8xbg,"wtf did i just watch? why was that funny in 2014? Like i get that kids are idiots (i probably had some bad tastes when i was 13-14), but why that?"
7275,2020-06-28 14:29:03,hh8xbg,its a really gross video of him pretending to masturbate to a poster of 11 year old willow smith
7276,2020-06-28 22:55:50,hh8xbg,"It will definitely affect them.  I don't think they'll be ""cancelled"" but I know that for me personally, I'm too disgusted by Shane to be willing to watch his fiances channel. Just because I don't want to see Shane. I can't be alone in that feeling."
7277,2020-06-30 00:35:33,hh8xbg,I think part of it depends on how they associate with him. Like if Morgan goes back to Colorado and doesnt talk about Shane for six months she should be very fine
7278,2020-06-29 18:17:57,hh8xbg,It's probably going to effect them in any sponsored videos going forward. Ryland has had lots of sponsors on his videos in the past. A lot of companies will probably drop him out of association.
7279,2020-06-28 08:55:40,hh8xbg,J* literally doomed him omg
7280,2020-06-28 10:56:00,hh8xbg,"I mean he made millions of dollars off of Jeffree, it's a win-win situation imo. I don't understand why he still tries to hold on to his career though, he could've left with dignity. He has the money to live very comfortably for the rest of his life. If I was him I would leave everything behind and move to Europe or something."

7282,2020-06-28 15:32:27,hh8xbg,"Shane ruined himself, he did all this before being friends with Jafar."
7283,2020-06-28 21:58:47,hh8xbg,"yes i agree! there is no way anyone could would or should defend pedophilia in any way. J\* still befriended Shane when this info was known to most people though, imo that alone was him defending Shane as a person without actually saying anything. I mean just me personally and I'm sure other people wouldn't start a friendship with someone whos had problematic pedophilic behavior.

Maybe (more than likely) they're talking behind the scenes but I guess since he quote tweeted shanes notes apology, i was expecting for him to at least retweet the video apology."

Everything after that has gone tits up. Every time something new and outrageous happens, I think to myself, ""Okay, well *that's* the most surprising thing 2020 has to offer yet!

All the drama aside, I hope he can recognize that saying something is a joke as a defence doesn‚Äôt change what he said or did."

I do however think that Jeffree retweeting it was calculated to make sure people went after Shane. He added that he was working on himself while Shane‚Äôs tweet clearly showed Shane had A LOT of work to do but decided to well come for everyone instead"
7299,2020-06-28 14:43:10,hh8xbg,I believe Shane did it but with a lot of influence from Jeffree. Shane seems like the type of person who really absorbs his friends personalities and just becomes some off brand version of them.
7300,2020-06-29 14:17:27,hh8xbg,The tone of the letter doesn't read as Jeffree at all. It has that AAVE-appropriating tone of Shane trying so hard to be a sassy gay man.

There is SO MUCH in his past which is just... inexcusable. And he has consistently lied about it. I‚Äôll try find the sticky drama post, but he did also bring a (fake rhinestoned, but looked real apparently) gun to a club, and threatened to kill someone, I think their name was Andrew or Anthony Vanity (not Dahvie; but same scene surname, not sure if they have a connection, but Vanity was common). 

But this example of the Pride incident- he boasted about it on his MySpace page; when the media was covering his version of events (which made him look ‚Äútough‚Äù for standing up to ‚Äúhaters‚Äù, and also painted him in a ‚Äúgood‚Äù light). Then he let slip that she didn‚Äôt actually do anything; and the truth came out.

We saw the same thing happen with the Dahvie Vanity situation being discussed in April of this year. First he messaged Petty Paige and called Blaire White claiming those old tweets were photoshopped and fake. Then he spoke to Chris Hansen and said they were real, but he never saw anything (and he controlled that interview, and still contradicted himself, and the lying to paint himself in a good light was so clear).

Essentially what I‚Äôve noticed; he likes the control the narrative; to paint himself in the best way possible. All his insta stories are scripted, it‚Äôs obvious (the most obvious example of this to me is during the start of the BLM movement this year- the way he exaggerated some words, feigned sympathy in some areas and anger in others: it came off as practiced, scripted and insincere- in my opinion). But he doesn‚Äôt reallly realllllly do one on one sit down interviews; if he does- he needs to control the questions (he fucking asked himself questions in the chris Hansen ‚Äúinterview‚Äù, and he called ‚ÄúJessie Slaughter‚Äù (now Damien) a liar which I‚Äôm still fucking pissed about), OR he has something ready to go (the voice note in moms basement) when things get to hard for him (it happened when Colossal was going in on him; and I wish Colossal had more time to prepare honestly)."

I started to follow Jafar during the MySpace days (even knew him before on livejournal, bur really got into him during my teenage edgy years). It's kinda hard to realize you don't really know someone who you followed and looked up to for so long, and accept they are a bad person. It's almost like if he was a real friend at this point. But now I understand how problematic he is and how toxic he's been to me during the years I was the most fragile. He used to glorify and make self harm look so glam, I'm sure it influenced me to start cutting myself. He's like a cult leader, it's kinda hard to get out of his grip even when you don't know him irl. 


What I can't understand is that people are still listening to his music. I mean, you can think it's good when you're 14yo but have you listened to this shit? I'm so glad he never got into mainstream pop."

Celebrities have used NDAs to ensure that signatories keep certain personal or private information confidential or else ‚Äúpay up‚Äù incredibly hefty amounts for breaching that agreement.

7476,2020-06-28 07:53:24,hh8xbg,Its not illegal to be an asshole. but the info could harm his business.
7477,2020-06-28 11:56:15,hh8xbg,I agree but it may be a case of the legal papers and lawyers being enough to scare them. Especially if you don't have any legal knowledge or the money to hire some help
7478,2020-06-28 09:35:10,hh8xbg,"With security cams in houses in CA, video doesnt require consent but yes audio does, including phonecalls"
7479,2020-06-28 17:32:42,hh8xbg,"Agreed. Instead of letting the victim come forward when they're comfortable with it, Jeffree is weaponizing the voice note against JC for his own personal gain. Smh. Disgusting."

7483,2020-06-28 06:41:54,hh8xbg,"It was after they were dared to kiss each other, I‚Äôm sure it got hella weird after that. IMO, Onion boy seemed so obsessive about Shane but I remember YouTube back there was a debate about who‚Äôs cuter & many felt Shane was. That definitely caused a rift."
7484,2020-06-28 06:47:58,hh8xbg,Didn‚Äôt they have a blowout because they made out/were a thing and then Onision said it publicly and Shane denied it? Am I remembering that wrong?
7485,2020-06-28 06:52:04,hh8xbg,"According to Wikipedia ""Physiognomy¬†as understood in the past meets the contemporary definition of a¬†pseudoscience"" I didn't read more than that lol"
7486,2020-06-28 06:54:50,hh8xbg,Absolutely DO NOT hype up physiognomy in 2020. It's a racist pseudo-science from 1800s.

7495,2020-06-28 20:11:40,hh8xbg,"Regardless of how problematic BW is, it doesn't make her automatically wrong about everything. Playing a vm from an (alleged) rape victim to uninvolved randos to manipulate them is beyond fucked up. The validity of the vm doesn't even matter - it's incredibly fucked up either way. I can't imagine how conflicted and upset I would feel if I was put in that position,  because there is no ""right"" way to handle it. Not really. If it's faked, you add more fuel to the ""rape victims are liars"" fire; if it's real, you're violating someone's privacy in a really horrible way, and outing them is just a further violation. 

If we didn't already know how completely without a conscience J* is, this would prove it. What a disgusting way to manipulate people."
7496,2020-06-28 19:28:29,hh8xbg,Omg yes! This clown would be honored ü§°ü§°

This must be the offshoot that couldn't handle the potential for criticism on his main sub lol."

7501,2020-06-29 12:02:54,hh8xbg,I feel the same way. I really like Ryland and think he‚Äôs a genuine person. I prefer his content over Shane‚Äôs.
7502,2020-06-28 07:53:13,hh8xbg,*Since the Jake Paul thing happened
7503,2020-06-28 09:20:38,hh8xbg,Even before that. When the Jake paul docuseries happened it was one of the few places on the internet that wasn't praising Shane
7504,2020-06-28 06:19:37,hh8xbg,LOL I THOUGHT OF THAT TOO. It really is like onion's reddit right now. Literally everything I looked at is is 'Shane is Trash' on that sub.
7505,2020-06-28 06:27:01,hh8xbg,I thought that one had always been private? At least since early last year. I tried checking it out around the Conspiracy series but could only access the jsc sub.
7506,2020-06-28 06:23:10,hh8xbg,Yeah I'm referring to the jsc reddit. I can't even see the jeffreestar reddit. I know the jsc reddit had a thread for fans to discuss the drama when it first came about but I don't know if it's still there or not. I know there were a lot of people criticizing him on there so maybe they took it down. I get the feeling like that sub is probably heavily moderated.
7507,2020-06-28 11:15:54,hh8xbg,"I don't think he suffers that much. Like, in Russia half of the people I watch and read (creators and comments both) cancelled him long ago, and another is like ""Well, he does great products, I don't care about his personality and continue to buy his stuff"" ü§¢ Suppose the same goes in many parts of the world exept USA and EU."
7508,2020-06-28 11:22:58,hh8xbg,Ok so I only saw the first series Shane did with JS but to me JS came out as bragging and over exaggerating his business ventures. You never know what his liquidity really is.
7509,2020-06-28 12:55:27,hh8xbg,Make-up isn‚Äôt selling well in general right now so he might still be their bestseller
7510,2020-06-28 11:46:47,hh8xbg,I didn‚Äôt even think of it that way omg...
7511,2020-06-28 12:01:21,hh8xbg,and the kardashians are friends with the smiths and i'm pretty sure they are not a fan o shane over his skits of them + his friendship with jeffree who they don't like either...
7512,2020-06-28 14:58:07,hh8xbg,"tbh I don't think Shane was ever going to work in hollywood, disgusting behaviour aside. He's just... not that skilled add to the fact that he's insufferable to work with and no one will be interested"
7513,2020-06-28 14:38:02,hh8xbg,I woudl assume that pedophiliic actions towards willow at that time were not unique  and wonder if  a part of why she didn't really continue with her career as a child. It must be  a sore point to see a eprson with a a platform promoting that shit
7514,2020-06-28 14:34:52,hh8xbg,I hope he does speak out. No father should have to see someone treat his daughter that way

He will keep going until someone with more money or power brings him down.  I doubt it will be the fans.  He is still popular."

7521,2020-06-28 13:31:31,hh8xbg,"Someone above said something about how when people say they internet was ""different 10 years ago"" it's because less adults were monitoring the goings on the of the internet and creepy ass people got a away with a lot of shit. J and S and others are just finally being held accountable for all of their disgusting shit."

7528,2020-06-29 13:52:58,hh8xbg,"My VERY vague and probably inaccurate recollection of Dramageddon 1: Gabriel Z, Nikita, Manny and Laura took a photo flipping off the camera in order to recreate a Kardashian post, then Gabriel posted it with the caption ""Bitch is bitter we're doing better without him"" (Something along those lines, I don't remember exactly), which was seen as shading Jeffree. Keep in mind that Gabriel apparently didn't consult anyone about that caption, and posted it without consent from the rest of the group. 

Then post first Shane series uwu poor boy Jeffwy called it out on Snapchat? Then his new fans went and shat on the four of them, which caused Manny to panic and ask Gabriel to take the picture down and apologize.

Then Gabriel got angry and called Manny out for not supporting him? There was a negative video involved towards Manny, but it was all pretty wishy washy.

While this is happening, people are digging up racist tweets from Nikita and Laura. Shit's on fire everywhere. 

Jeff cackles on Snapchat.

Gabriel Z denounces Manny and apologizes to jeff.

Laura posts the infamous apology video for her racist tweets and gets yeeted by the entire internet.

Manny tries to apologize for whatever the internet thought he did wrong in the situation. Which I can't even remember? All he did was want to diffuse the situation and Gabriel got offended? 

Nikita deflects about her own racist tweets. She leaves mostly unscathed.

Gabriel becomes Jeffree's lap dog.

And that's all I remember? Please correct me if I'm wrong üôÉ"

This‚Äôll turn into the teen mom sub where jenelle was sending out cease and desists, because people were talking about her child abuse and abusive husband. Now they only say ‚Äúredacted‚Äù or a code name for her.  And Jenelle ain‚Äôt got the money or power JJ has."
7538,2020-06-28 17:05:16,hh8xbg,"I realize it sounds too conspiracy theory, but fucking JJ over there I wouldn‚Äôt put it past him. He‚Äôs thrown people under the bus before and has a lot of money for legal teams etc. I also just find it too coincidental that this all started about him, and now the sole focus shifted completely to kielbason."

7544,2020-06-28 21:46:58,hh8xbg,He tried to rope James back in (delusional) and when that failed he went on the attack again. He‚Äôs like an abusive ex boyfriend.

She is using her position of power to exploit her viewers and vulnerable people."
7584,2020-06-29 17:35:29,hh8xbg,Ah yeah I fell for betterhelp. It‚Äôs truly awful. It‚Äôs way  more expensive than advertised and even though they make it seem like you can pay weekly the only way to sign up is for a month at a time. Then the actual help is a JOKE. they take a day to respond to your message with a short sentence usually asking something completely stupid you could know by reading your original message. Total scam

7587,2020-06-29 20:05:49,hh8xbg,"yeah i feel like whatever j\* and/or shane were planning (and there was clearly some planning) they probably didn't anticipate jenna leaving, or probably for the smiths getting involved. they don't have such a stranglehold on things in the bigger picture outside the beauty community. i wonder if they probably didn't also account for like. just the way people have changed so much since last year. it's a very different world, and people are reacting very differently now to all this resurfaced stuff and this manipulation than i think they would if this had happened even six months ago. i honestly can't see either shane or j\* having their heads enough in reality to take that into account."
7588,2020-06-29 18:56:58,hh8xbg,"Yeah, it would have happened eventually because he‚Äôs so problematic but he definitely expedited it lol."

7594,2020-06-28 22:00:17,hh8xbg,I reported it and got a response that they wouldn‚Äôt take it down.
7595,2020-06-28 21:40:54,hh8xbg,"Not sure why IG hasn't taken action. I reported it under the category you mentioned, no response from IG yet."
7596,2020-06-29 15:26:13,hh8xbg,Something something wishing for the ceo to get a rubber bullet on her head.
7597,2020-06-29 15:49:07,hh8xbg,"""Hope you get a rubber bullet in the head"" absolutely sick"
7598,2020-06-29 14:50:06,hh8xbg," ""i hope you have a beautiful morning and get a rubber bullet in the middle of your fucking head"""
7599,2020-06-29 15:13:58,hh8xbg,"I think it was after the Dollskill situation with a pic of police lined up in front of a building with the brand name on it, Jeffree told the CEO he ""hopes \[she\] gets a rubber bullet to the middle of \[her\] fcking head"""

7601,2020-06-29 01:48:54,hh8xbg,"I doubt it, and they shouldn‚Äôt have to anyways. That would be like quitting a job and having to pay the company back for the hours they paid you."
7602,2020-06-29 03:30:12,hh8xbg,No but you can‚Äôt make any more money off of them from new views (which is how a lot of youtubers make a steady income)
7603,2020-06-29 05:02:36,hh8xbg,"Yup. And I should say this clearly- people literally make money off of being edgy and racist. There‚Äôs a ‚Äúmarket‚Äù for it. J* made his whole brand out of shock value. This is not run of the mill microaggresion, this is hardcore racism.

I low key think J* is an actual white supremacist. Everything in his past, especially the Nazi lipstick thing and the recent allegations that he said horribly anti Semitic things, I think he runs in those circles."
7604,2020-06-29 05:05:05,hh8xbg,Yup I remember after that Kim K and Kylie (also culture vultures) got heat for like a minute for having him on their PR. And then it was over like that. It shouldn‚Äôt take white people outing other white people to validate them as racists. We should all be listening when black women speak the first time.
7605,2020-06-29 05:19:03,hh8xbg,"Immediate outrage. Look at how Tati white womaned the James Charles thing.

Also also, all of the white women in J* life, including this alt right shill Blaire whatever, who have openly supported and advocating for him knowing what his views are, show how complicit white women are in racism."
7606,2020-06-29 08:26:40,hh8xbg,"NGL, Sam would bodyslam him. Like I sincerely believe Sam would have no problem chopping him in the throat if he ever fixed himself to try that tbqh."
7607,2020-06-28 15:21:46,hh8xbg,"Oh for sure, but based on the tiny pieces of information he‚Äôs heard it definitely makes sense that he called it drama. Now if we could bring down J* as a racist predator as well then that would make my day!"
7608,2020-06-28 16:18:48,hh8xbg,Yes! That's my reasoning exactly.
7609,2020-06-28 16:46:07,hh8xbg,Same! I just briefed him on the Smith family and the reason they're involved and he's interested to see what happens!
7610,2020-06-28 12:35:03,hh8xbg,I'm so mad about this.
7611,2020-06-28 20:03:18,hh8xbg,"I have a feeling Ryland works hard for those Gucci slides and has to ""calm down"" Shane a lot."
7612,2020-06-28 20:09:32,hh8xbg,Very reminiscent of Shane‚Äôs behavior in that reality show about making ‚ÄúNot Cool‚Äù
7613,2020-06-28 20:54:05,hh8xbg,I totally recommend his YouTube channel. He's hilarious and non problematic
7614,2020-06-28 20:25:32,hh8xbg,Absolutely agree. Shane must use his toilet to flush all his friends away since lord knows he's using water bottles to urinate in.
7615,2020-06-28 20:40:05,hh8xbg,"Me too. His editing style is hilarious. I love his podcast also, ‚ÄúMessy With Mac and Mike‚Äù or something like that?? They‚Äôre so funny together."
7616,2020-06-29 08:44:02,hh8xbg,Colleen is obsessed with her body and weight
7617,2020-06-30 02:16:30,hh8xbg,"With advertisers pulling from facebook, I'm surprised Youtube isn't the least bit worried. I have a feeling big youtubers deleting videos aren't just about deleting evidence - because if it was still available people can see which ads were being played for racist / sexualizing minors content."
7618,2020-06-30 03:57:38,hh8xbg,"It's really excellent, D'Angelo never lets me down"
7619,2020-06-28 06:14:18,hh8xbg,But Shane did choose Jeffree to be his family so he can just as easily disown him. Also blood don‚Äôt mean shit. No family member is entitled to be in your life
7620,2020-06-28 05:51:46,hh8xbg,What comment?! üëÄ
7621,2020-06-28 06:15:56,hh8xbg,"It wasn‚Äôt really a good defense imo, Shane basically said yes Jefree is shit but I still love him. I wouldn‚Äôt defend Shane either. Even in his new apology video he was dissing Jefree saying he is shit and he knows it. If I was Jefree it would be on to save myself. Knowing Jefree, he is if anything a survivor, I bet that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs thinking. I mean Shane said nothing that was redeeming for Jefree imo."
7622,2020-06-28 11:48:33,hh8xbg,"Right, it was so obvious it was damage control."
7623,2020-06-28 17:05:51,hh8xbg,Not to mention the fact that Jenna took accountability bc she knew she was in the wrong and genuinely needed to apologize and right her wrongs.  Nobody was coming for her; she did this bc she‚Äôs ACTUALLY changed into a better person.  Shane only made his video bc the Internet is canceling him; he mentioned her to make himself look like he‚Äôs on her level
7624,2020-06-28 12:37:03,hh8xbg,"She only told half the story. But I think her apology was just an out because she was done, anyway. So I'm not as bothered by that as I am by Shane."
7625,2020-06-28 12:12:18,hh8xbg,"I haven't watched her video because I'm barely aware of who she is, but now I will."
7626,2020-06-28 16:12:08,hh8xbg,He‚Äôs would be totally done if he pisses off any kpop group. Kpop stans would come together and you don‚Äôt want To go against the fandoms when they all come together
7627,2020-06-28 16:40:33,hh8xbg,Kpop activism has almost convinced me to give kpop a shot. I love them.
7628,2020-06-28 17:01:39,hh8xbg,he made a conspiracy video about kpop in the past and it was awful...wait until someone decides to dig that up
7629,2020-06-28 16:19:53,hh8xbg,I‚Äôm still surprised Kid Cudi retweeted both Jada and Jaden‚Äôs tweets about Shane.
7630,2020-06-28 16:08:18,hh8xbg,And Dan and Phil fans
7631,2020-06-28 23:46:30,hh8xbg,"he stated this on the Moms Basement podcast, where he also said Tati ruined James career, not him."
7632,2020-06-28 23:50:27,hh8xbg,"He didn't bring it up publicly during dramageddon last year, as far as I know, but he did speak of it privately - he mentions having it with Ashlye Kyle and she exposed this on her video about being on his payroll, if my memory serves."
7633,2020-06-29 00:02:29,hh8xbg,Mom's Basement podcast. Jeffree said it himself
7634,2020-06-29 05:01:35,hh8xbg,Fucking same lol
7635,2020-06-29 06:07:09,hh8xbg,That was the first time I've clicked a link in here that had Shiddy Doodoo or John Stamos in it that I haven't left viewing with smoke coming out of my ears lol
7636,2020-06-29 13:18:36,hh8xbg,"Don‚Äôt worry! It‚Äôs funny, nothing traumatic dug up from the past"
7637,2020-06-29 15:02:18,hh8xbg,"Yes! I will believe a victim if/when they come forward but until then it's just another rumor perpetuated by a racist, liar, and rape apologist."
7638,2020-06-29 15:02:18,hh8xbg,J* has been claiming since last year to have a memo proving JC's guilt. Despite backing out last year he's bringing it up again now and trying to get drama commenters to say what it says
7639,2020-06-29 15:00:46,hh8xbg,"Jafar says he has a voice memo from last year from an alleged victim of JC. He has played it for Blaire White (a known r*cist among other things) and said he played it for Faze and Keemstar but Keemstar has said he didn't hear it.

BW said she ""reached out"" to the victim but never actually spoke with them."
7640,2020-06-29 15:12:17,hh8xbg,"I used to like jeffree, but I wasn‚Äôt crazy about him. I had some of his products (currently unsure what I‚Äôm going to do with them since yeah I spent money but I also feel uncomfortable af using them) but I can‚Äôt with him anymore. He‚Äôs an eel. He‚Äôs oily. He gets out of every situation."
7641,2020-06-29 15:25:49,hh8xbg,This is an underrated comment.
7642,2020-06-29 15:37:20,hh8xbg,I remember back when he started getting critical about his docu series videos (because I was one of the ones to criticize him) and it was like every other post was defense of him or positive or whatever. Now that sub is burning.
7643,2020-06-29 15:22:07,hh8xbg,That‚Äôs 100% a cult.
7644,2020-06-29 15:12:35,hh8xbg,Jumanji Shampoo I‚Äôm deceased.
7645,2020-06-29 15:21:48,hh8xbg,Really???? Damn.. that‚Äôs censoring speech. I also noticed that the majority of people posting there are yt people ü§°
7646,2020-06-29 15:20:27,hh8xbg,"Im literally crying, I‚Äôll use it as my flair if you don‚Äôt mind haha"
7647,2020-06-29 15:33:43,hh8xbg,Not surprised.
7648,2020-06-29 16:43:02,hh8xbg,"I thought someone might've not been white for a second but nope, just a really really dark tan."
7649,2020-06-29 18:26:57,hh8xbg,"Sorry to bash them but let's be real. They are also trash at makeup. I swear most of them had never used eyeshadow before trying JSC and never buy anything other than JSC (maybe Morphe at best) so when they say ""Jeffree has the best eyeshadow formula"" they are not lying. They've just never tried anything else."
7650,2020-06-29 17:05:15,hh8xbg,"Yeah. Everyone keeps talking as if this voice memo definitely exists and throwing around names of ‚Äúwell petty Paige heard it!‚Äù Or ‚Äúkeem listened to it!!!‚Äù But I literally keep running into people saying ‚Äúnope. I don‚Äôt know why people are assuming I heard it. I just know it exists and someone else heard it‚Äù

This is such a weird philosophical and psychological mind fuck.  Lmao schrodingers voice memo."
7651,2020-06-29 17:54:36,hh8xbg,Thank you for the silver ü•∫
7652,2020-06-29 17:33:09,hh8xbg,"This. I feel like Jeffree is weaponising the ""believe the victim"" mantra in his favor.

I also want to point out that, according to Jeffree, the memo isn't even from the victim themselves, but from a third party. So this is even more fragile than people are assuming. It's still hearsay \_even if\_ the memo is real."
7653,2020-06-29 16:54:25,hh8xbg,"Yeah. I don‚Äôt want to possibly discredit a victim if it‚Äôs true, but too many things are not lining up. Jeffree says the recording is if someone else telling him about the assault. Blaire said it was testimony from the victim themselves. And now I am struggling to find anyone who can solidly confirm they heard the memo even though jeffree is supposedly just throwing this around to anyone and everyone."
7654,2020-06-29 17:07:16,hh8xbg,Thank you for double confirmation :)
7655,2020-06-29 16:55:04,hh8xbg,"I just watched Ashley‚Äôs most recent video and she said she did not hear the voice note herself, she just believed whatever jeffree told her at the time... hearsay"
7656,2020-06-29 16:50:38,hh8xbg,Like it‚Äôs just sus. That would be the lynch pin in this. All he would have to do is share it with one of his little dream team of drama channels and then they would ALL KNOW it‚Äôs real and not ‚Äúwell I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs real and I think someone else listened to it‚Äù
7657,2020-06-29 17:00:31,hh8xbg,Ty. I find myself losing life force everytime I hear his name or see him in a video now. I try to avoid his side of the internet.
7658,2020-06-29 19:14:03,hh8xbg,"As far as I can tell, blaire is the only person to have come forward and said that she heard it. And people definitely don't trust her to be a reliable source. Meaning: How can she be so sure what she was hearing was credible? If she believed it she seems easily manipulated by Jafar. And finally: Maybe she just made all this shit up to get heat off of shane."
7659,2020-06-29 02:16:00,hh8xbg,What did it say?
7660,2020-06-28 07:24:23,hh8xbg,Definitely. I feel like he‚Äôs trying to find a lawsuit in all of this. He‚Äôs not going down without a fight.
7661,2020-06-28 07:26:36,hh8xbg,"This ain‚Äôt it. Please stop gatekeeping, this forum has given him hilarious nicknames for awhile now. It‚Äôs a small form of comedic relief for some in a discussion about awful vile human beings."
7662,2020-06-28 07:22:58,hh8xbg,"??? this entire thread is giving nicknames. Stop trying to police it. If publicly addressing him, or on twitter or other social media, yeah, it‚Äôs better to use his full name. Especially when using hastags."
7663,2020-06-28 08:09:56,hh8xbg,"Chill, you're all over this thread with this shit. This is the 7th Megathread in like a week with his full name. Literally everyone knows who each silly nickname is talking about"
7664,2020-06-28 20:28:50,hh8xbg,"I get what you mean, people need to make more noise using his name, but on Twitter and under his insta posts and his companies insta posts. No one is looking on this subreddit for information, theyre checking Twitter and other socials imo. Personally I like the nickname here, and he is pretty well known to block people that talk about him negatively but searching for his name, this is a way around that"
7665,2020-06-28 12:05:44,hh8xbg,"I remember the whole Trisha claiming to have DID thing, and I remember DissociaDID responding but I had no idea she bullied them to that extent wtf"
7666,2020-06-28 12:09:02,hh8xbg,"Wait WHAT

I used to follow DissociaDID a lot, then with uni and other stuff I kinda forgot to keep up with them.

I‚Äôve heard they‚Äôve been through a lot though, like whatever happened with Team Pi√±ata? Are they okay?"
7667,2020-06-28 18:37:05,hh8xbg,One of the lead singers in Blood On The Dancefloor
7668,2020-06-28 18:39:19,hh8xbg,"Lead singer of Blood on the Dance Floor, an emo band that toured with Jeffree back in the day and was big on myspace. If you google him, you'll get a ton of info."
7669,2020-06-28 19:15:50,hh8xbg,He does
7670,2020-06-28 19:13:36,hh8xbg,"Confirmed , he does . ?!?"
7671,2020-06-28 20:52:18,hh8xbg,"To what goal, though? I just don't get what Jeffree is trying to achieve from this. Who the fuck is left for him to social climb?"
7672,2020-06-28 20:52:47,hh8xbg,EXACTLY! *moving the Blair ship* towards JC. *Shane's ship is sinking* in the middle atm üòù

7679,2020-06-29 01:52:05,hh8xbg,But that was a good band!! üò≠ü§£
7680,2020-06-29 03:36:38,hh8xbg,I made the grave mistake of listening to the audio where he talks about the six year old (don‚Äôt want to say her name).  He goes into pedophilia.   I threw up a little bit in my mouth.
7681,2020-06-29 03:50:53,hh8xbg,"I'm sure they'll find plenty of porn. Of what kind, who knows.  Ryland did mention Shame has a porn addiction in one of his vlogs."
7682,2020-06-29 03:43:29,hh8xbg,"Adding to this, I hope they investigate him properly if/when he tries to adopt. I don‚Äôt like the idea of him around children, it‚Äôs disturbing"

7684,2020-06-29 07:52:17,hh8xbg,">How did he get away with this for so long? 

People let him get away with it. Hell, even in that thread I linked, a couple of people were defending it as him being in ""character""."

7687,2020-06-28 10:01:12,hh8xbg,I prefer the name Jafar but anything but his actual name lmao
7688,2020-06-28 09:59:40,hh8xbg,It‚Äôs like cockroaches that survive nuclear disasters while everything else around them just straight up gets obliterated
7689,2020-06-28 11:29:44,hh8xbg,"Yeah but he is not posting in a way that people can actually comment (instagram posts instead of stories, Twitter...)"

7697,2020-06-29 09:21:57,hh8xbg,Don't you think that could be a cover for trying to unfollow Joe Schmoe without being obvious? The Dolan twins are notorious for trying to stay out of drama. If they only unfollowed a single person it would be a lot more obvious than just unfollowing a group of people.

7705,2020-06-29 13:41:57,hh8xbg,Grosssss! Seems like the fine bros are fine with this shit since they just allow that in their video.
7706,2020-06-29 13:38:43,hh8xbg,Yes his mum! I don‚Äôt know why everyone thinks she‚Äôs so innocent when clearly she goes along with Shane. She gives me the creeps too!
7707,2020-06-29 16:54:10,hh8xbg,"Yeah, Shane looks nothing like that 99.9% of the time."
7708,2020-06-29 18:28:08,hh8xbg,lol underrated comment
7709,2020-06-29 17:00:15,hh8xbg,Which just makes their relationship sketchy as hell.
7710,2020-06-29 16:59:54,hh8xbg,Yeah I was literally just thinking that üòÇ At what point in the relationship do you sign an NDA? Like right before they broke up? Or at the beginning?
7711,2020-06-29 22:01:02,hh8xbg,Drama channels are run by some weirdos.
7712,2020-06-29 21:05:14,hh8xbg,"I didn't know him before all this started, but I don't like it. I understand the performative nature of drama channels and commentary channels ~~that like pretending they're different~~, but he sounds like a daytime gossiping show and that's very off-putting to me. Now, I also meet Liam with the jovfefe videos, but I really liked how he presented information in a kinda essay-ish  format (which I've seen some people absolutely hated it).  So to me it'll come down to how they present whatever they find out, hopefully it'll be Liam's method."

7717,2020-06-30 04:08:10,hh8xbg,"An investor probably wouldn‚Äôt need to be consulted about tiny operational decisions like that. Normally it‚Äôs things like CEO and other exec hiring, M&A or very large changes. Dropping a brand isn‚Äôt something he would have contractual rights to prevent"
7718,2020-06-30 03:56:58,hh8xbg,That's what I'm wondering. I don't know much about corporate governance but I guess a board could overrule the wishes of a single investor? Or he could be a part of it? Either scenario is interesting.
7719,2020-06-28 20:39:43,hh8xbg,Maybe check Blaire's channel buddy
7720,2020-06-28 23:04:30,hh8xbg,same :D
7721,2020-06-28 23:05:42,hh8xbg,Hahahahaha

7724,2020-06-29 17:31:05,hh8xbg,You hit the nail on the head
7725,2020-06-29 17:38:45,hh8xbg,"I wasn‚Äôt around for dramageddon 1 I have no idea what went down there. But like they have all this evidence of Jeff being a shit person and this, /this/ is what makes them turn on him. Garbage."
7726,2020-06-28 13:10:49,hh8xbg,she was defending jeffree not too long ago with tons of wrong information - as per usual. I'm pretty sure that's just her going on full damage control after making a fool out of herself.
7727,2020-06-28 13:19:05,hh8xbg,Jesus Christ that‚Äôs so accurate
7728,2020-06-28 13:47:39,hh8xbg,Yeah because that‚Äôs what people are gonna do lol.
7729,2020-06-28 06:51:15,hh8xbg,Oh I should have been more clear but I meant all of the huge influencers and accounts on Twitter! I know everyone here has taste in this aspect
7730,2020-06-28 16:08:34,hh8xbg,I got it as a notification too. It‚Äôs going to everyone‚Äôs phones
7731,2020-06-28 16:54:08,hh8xbg,I don‚Äôt know how to link it but Newsweek and channel 4 are covering the story too
7732,2020-06-28 16:44:24,hh8xbg,I read this in Peter‚Äôs voice
7733,2020-06-28 08:51:34,hh8xbg,Haha thank you :)
7734,2020-06-28 23:58:01,hh8xbg,How do you support someone who starts beef with a child? Like just ignore him jeff ur a 35yo man
7735,2020-06-29 02:55:21,hh8xbg,That was kinda hilarious Jaffa getting called out by a 10 y/o. Though.
7736,2020-06-29 00:18:23,hh8xbg,"He was obsessed with Khloe‚Äôs breakup with Tristan cheating on her. And suddenly when it‚Äôs Jeffree and Nate it‚Äôs ‚Äònot tea, it‚Äôs my life ü•∫‚Äô"

7738,2020-06-28 23:56:12,hh8xbg,I don‚Äôt know the details but I remember it trending on twitter when it happened. I think the kid said something to Jeff and he responded something about him being spoiled?
7739,2020-06-30 01:43:54,hh8xbg,lol and ppl were so mad at bieber about thinking Ann Frank might have been a fan
7740,2020-06-30 00:59:35,hh8xbg,"Yeah, think he got those directions messed up cause I‚Äôm sure 6yo didn‚Äôt know who he was, like most people"
7741,2020-06-30 01:47:56,hh8xbg,Omg off topic but is that the Kim K jungle meme but in emoji? I‚Äôm here for it
7742,2020-06-30 00:10:58,hh8xbg,Jonbenet was I think a little pageant girl who was murdered in the mid 90s. I don‚Äôt know the whole story but i think it blew up because she was found in her house. There‚Äôs a whole buzzfeed unsolved episode around it..
7743,2020-06-28 09:58:51,hh8xbg,"That‚Äôs definitely possible, but I wonder if he didn‚Äôt speak out if people would have continued to focus on Jersey Shore. The notes definitely shifted the focus from Jeffree to Shane."
7744,2020-06-28 10:32:28,hh8xbg,When did this happen?!
7745,2020-06-28 11:03:50,hh8xbg,Hopefully this means he‚Äôs finally being held accountable. It‚Äôs infuriating when stans think making an apology video is the definition of being accountable and changing for the better.
7746,2020-06-28 12:57:48,hh8xbg,His collab aswel as the collabs with James an Jacqueline are on sale every 3-4 weeks I feel like. I get those emails all the time

7749,2020-06-28 19:22:05,hh8xbg,Truth. His reckoning is going to be meteoric when it lands.
7750,2020-06-28 19:43:50,hh8xbg,"it‚Äôs disgusting. the power imbalance is so apparent and i hope that kid in the video is ok today, she deserves so much better than having this documented for the entire world to see forever"

7757,2020-06-28 21:51:16,hh8xbg,How many people have actually come out and said they heard the voice memo? Just one by my count and she's a known liar.
7758,2020-06-28 21:35:23,hh8xbg,Keem himself is being cancelled today I‚Äôm surprised he had time to address this
7759,2020-06-28 21:35:23,hh8xbg,I wonder if j* has dirt on him‚Ä¶ since he supposedly has dirt on everyone
7760,2020-06-28 23:00:16,hh8xbg,I remember watching them when I was like 13/14 thinking it was the funniest thing. Looking back in it it was so weird and inappropriate. No one now could ever make content like that without getting cancelled
7761,2020-06-29 02:40:25,hh8xbg,"Well, Liza also has a history of playing characters that are racially insensitive"
7762,2020-06-29 02:21:24,hh8xbg,David tends to just keep quite because of DACA
7763,2020-06-29 02:19:52,hh8xbg,I think it is. And I think she was intentionally trying to deflect attention from Shane.
7764,2020-06-29 02:27:08,hh8xbg,Does anyone else find it weird that it‚Äôs just silent? She doesn‚Äôt say anything?
7765,2020-06-29 03:01:17,hh8xbg,"Eh, I kinda agree, but the whole thing sounds like it was written by a PR person or in the very least she had professional proofing done.  Not that I think that's a bad thing though. I applaud her for it actually.  In these sensitive situations it's hard to gather your thoughts, be concise, and get your word out quick. PR people have the experience and insight to help navigate what your fans would want you to address and what you really want people to get out of your statement."
7766,2020-06-29 02:37:09,hh8xbg,"Same, but I 100% believe Lottie because 6 months ago they said there was triggering shit he said to them bc they ran in the same circles when J* went to Canada"
7767,2020-06-29 09:16:54,hh8xbg,I think you may have nailed it.
7768,2020-06-29 16:17:50,hh8xbg,"He‚Äôs a malignant narcissistic, he takes joy in tearing other people down and has little empathy while also being completely full of himself, over-all delusional tbh

Edit: [I‚Äôm not kidding here‚Äôs a video series on malignant narcissism. tell me this doesn‚Äôt describe him to the T](https://youtu.be/3J4MEQ3N03w)"
7769,2020-06-29 15:43:30,hh8xbg,"It's crazy to me how so many people are still a fan of him. Like I can kinda understand that a lot of people follow and watch him (even I have been guilty of it for a long time). 

He's just a really outspoken person who lives a crazy lifestyle and people like watching that. There's a reason why Laura Lee was cancelled so quickly, because she just isn't that entertaning while J* is. 

Now, I don't get people who are an actual FAN of this person. People who defend him, constantly buy his products and who go against every ""allegation"" even though there's so much proof. I buy products if I'm a fan of someone and him still being so succesful says a lot."
7770,2020-06-29 18:41:35,hh8xbg,thank you!!!
7771,2020-06-29 18:41:40,hh8xbg,u the best
7772,2020-06-29 17:40:58,hh8xbg,I don‚Äôt know how custom feeds work but I added sleepycaterpillar to mine and I think if they post something it will show up there? But without notifications
7773,2020-06-29 21:48:29,hh8xbg,"His professional relationships with the people that are around him the most must be so tense right now. They probably want to keep a distance but if they do, Jeffree has no one to talk to. I bet he is all alone in his mansion ranting to tired assistants who just want to go home"
7774,2020-06-29 23:01:09,hh8xbg,"Uh oh....makes sense though, he‚Äôs always been very open about how shitty he used to be"
7775,2020-06-29 22:49:48,hh8xbg,He can‚Äôt NOT. It‚Äôs TOO big in the mainstream. But I feel like there are major implications because of both Shane and Phil being very close to YT corporate
7776,2020-06-29 22:59:40,hh8xbg,"He will cover it, I will be shocked if he shares his thoughts and opinions. Knowing Phil he will only tell what happened and asked to join the conversation below üôÑ"
7777,2020-06-29 23:27:22,hh8xbg,He sounded raspy so I think physically ill.
7778,2020-06-29 23:05:36,hh8xbg,I dont have a twitter so thank you for the update!

7790,2020-06-28 07:08:56,hh8xbg,Highly recommend her. She posts rants that are really entertaining but all of her points are just so... CORRECT! like she says the shit that should be said and she doesn't mince words - she don't sugarcoat.

7792,2020-06-28 07:53:32,hh8xbg,nothing publicly happened but garrett hasnt been in any of his videos for quite some time so people are speculating that they‚Äôre no longer friends. this barely shady tik tok comment is now contributing to that speculation

7804,2020-06-28 17:23:48,hh8xbg,It's also immoral to share if the victim wants it to remain private. That could be traumatizing.
7805,2020-06-28 17:23:09,hh8xbg,Absolutely. Take it to the police. I'm sorry except I'm not sorry if you have evidence of abuse and you choose to use it for your own gain through black mail rather than bring justice to a victim  you deserve to be yeeted into the bin
7806,2020-06-28 17:27:57,hh8xbg,"Well he can, because apparently he is"
7807,2020-06-28 17:23:05,hh8xbg,Either there's ongoing litigation and he was legally barred from posting the receipts or the victim asked him not to and he respected that. Not very respectful to play it to other people anyway though.
7808,2020-06-28 17:48:11,hh8xbg,"How is being against transphobia ""senstive as fuck""? Newsflash, it's okay to be critical of hate speech."
7809,2020-06-28 18:50:09,hh8xbg,"right? and i see these people out here going ""oh OBVIOUSLY blaire couldn't play the voice memo because that would be disrespectful to the victim"" and acting like we're supposed to be grateful to her for what, making a video and hyping up all the vultures to go ""omg this is SERIOUS now the victim needs to come forward"" and speculate on who it is? either there's a victim who's being pressured into going public when they don't want to, or there isn't a victim and this is another attempt to smear james charles' name, or somewhere in between where things have been exaggerated and twisted. imo the only actually respectful thing to do is just to ignore this until a victim actually does come forward. people can stop pretending that hunting them down and exposing the truth is for the good of anyone because it's just making everything worse."
7810,2020-06-28 22:14:54,hh8xbg,Yes! They easily could have taken accountability and it would be done for them. They‚Äôve made it worse themselves. [Franchesa Ramsey responded to Nikki‚Äôs tweet of their ‚Äúcontext‚Äù explanation. ](https://twitter.com/chescaleigh/status/1277290563478355969?s=21)

7816,2020-06-29 12:05:24,hh8xbg,Money and sounded like fear tactic was involved. Blackmail is illegal. No one went to the police so that‚Äôs why the police was never involved.

7818,2020-06-29 18:00:02,hh8xbg,I agree completely - there's so much more going on than just discussed in the article. Imagine if the NYT would do a rundown of the Dramageddons and Jeflon Sefeve's past.. weeh chile I'd pay good money to read that

7824,2020-06-29 21:19:36,hh8xbg,Due to the pandemic Keemstar wasn‚Äôt in the same location and they were recording so that might be the reason he didn‚Äôt want to play it to him
7825,2020-06-29 21:06:07,hh8xbg,It's probably so fake that anyone trustworthy or with a good public image wouldn't even discuss it.
7826,2020-06-29 21:04:37,hh8xbg,At the same time it makes you wonder why he‚Äôs bothering at all. If he is really out to get JC then putting that into the hands of someone the majority of the internet doesnt trust makes the unlike/impossible
7827,2020-06-29 21:22:57,hh8xbg,I'm sorry but it HAS TO BE ILLEGAL for him to release it. I just... it would be so gross if he released it.
7828,2020-06-29 21:11:11,hh8xbg,"Ohhhhh shit I didnt know that, that makes this all the more interesting. You are on to something, Jeffree certainly benefits from controlling the narrative"

7830,2020-06-29 21:02:32,hh8xbg,Keem said on twitter he never heard the memo
7831,2020-06-29 21:23:57,hh8xbg,It's not a written memo - it's an audio recording. Just to clarify
7832,2020-06-30 03:29:19,hh8xbg,Yes... as I just said
7833,2020-06-28 15:59:19,hh8xbg,I‚Äôm guessing it has something to do with the views/monetization if his channels? Like maybe he was making residual money from the views on that channel? Idk how the business aspects of YouTube work tbh but that‚Äôs my assumption.

7865,2020-06-28 20:14:31,hh8xbg,Definitely studied from the best.
7866,2020-06-28 06:06:39,hh8xbg,"I can agree to this. I started watching Shane when I was 9 years old, I'm 20 now. Back in 2010 I had no idea how offensive or racist a lot of the things he did and said were, and I honestly think he normalised that behaviour for a lot of young kids. He never took accountability when people have called him out before, so it's clear right now he's interested in saving his own skin."
7867,2020-06-28 06:17:24,hh8xbg,This is a good point
7868,2020-06-28 06:38:37,hh8xbg,not to mention the sheer amount of allegations coming out about gaming content creators
7869,2020-06-28 11:04:12,hh8xbg,Of course but it‚Äôs not that the general society thinks black face or the n word was ok it‚Äôs just pre adpocalypse it was less monitored
7870,2020-06-28 18:50:42,hh8xbg, the adsense is enough for her. Just by using his name she'll get the clicks and the $$

7874,2020-06-28 20:49:15,hh8xbg,Every time I see someone mention the Smiths I keep thinking of the band first lmao

7876,2020-06-28 20:47:14,hh8xbg,I‚Äôm starting to think most everyone on this platform is under the age of 40. Most don‚Äôt know who The Smiths were.
7877,2020-06-28 12:58:25,hh8xbg,"yeah i know, but as a kid who started watching youtube in the early 2010, people used the ""its just a joke"" excuse a lot more and and a lot of ppl just bought it. im not saying its right or nobody was calling it out, but a lot more people accepted the ""its just a joke"" excuse than nowadays."
7878,2020-06-28 14:45:51,hh8xbg,"Yeah, I don't think most people here realize he's publicly talked about being sexually abused as a child. Doesn't make his ""jokes"" okay, but gives it some, uh, context."
7879,2020-06-28 13:40:17,hh8xbg,"‚ÄúWell, it looks like Shane‚Äôs like ratio is pretty good, which shows that he‚Äôs probably forgiven, but what do you think?‚Äù"
7880,2020-06-28 13:39:51,hh8xbg,I imagine it would have some serious blowback to him if he is seen defending this giving the magnitude of celebrities now involved.
7881,2020-06-28 13:51:40,hh8xbg,"He has kids, I dont know how a person with kids can fence sit on this."
7882,2020-06-28 13:55:35,hh8xbg,"Actually they used to be part of a collaboration type of channel together called the Station,. This was over a decade ago but their circles have definitely overlapped."
7883,2020-06-28 14:05:53,hh8xbg,They were a part of The Station together
7884,2020-06-28 14:03:27,hh8xbg,Just looked through her Twitter and have no idea what you are talking about.
7885,2020-06-28 14:03:22,hh8xbg,omg tell us everything
7886,2020-06-28 14:10:04,hh8xbg,oh what‚Äôs she been doing?
7887,2020-06-28 14:01:26,hh8xbg,Oof i haven't paid attention to him in a while. What did his wife do?
7888,2020-06-28 14:27:28,hh8xbg,What did his wife do?
7889,2020-06-28 16:29:01,hh8xbg,Same! I got put in the hospital for really bad depression and anxiety and I nor the people on my floor who also had similar issues seemed to talk about 'sexy children.'
7890,2020-06-28 21:30:03,hh8xbg,Your comment gets it right on the nose and makes me question who I‚Äôve been supporting for all this time
7891,2020-06-28 23:14:25,hh8xbg,"The best comments are ""is this a rebranding because his shtick isn't working anymore?"" And ""Where's YouTube's apology?"""
7892,2020-06-29 11:48:23,hh8xbg,"If this doesn't happen, then frankly what's even the point"
7893,2020-06-29 12:34:06,hh8xbg,I often referred to her as Tatti after dramageddon 2 last year
7894,2020-06-29 12:50:55,hh8xbg,Ugh that goatee.
7895,2020-06-29 13:15:16,hh8xbg,Honestly jerugala salantro seems so obsessed with JC at the moment that it's kind of sad. You're 34 years old. Don't you have anything better to focus on?
7896,2020-06-29 14:25:11,hh8xbg,Did he? What was it?
7897,2020-06-29 19:02:01,hh8xbg,"At this point, i wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if his business associate has got him trapped in a bunker with no internet access somewhere."
7898,2020-06-30 01:03:35,hh8xbg,omg andrew is probably filming his breakdown right now.
7899,2020-06-28 20:36:00,hh8xbg,"The problem is they have all willingly engaged in this behavior publicly. Its not the same as other celebrities because of the way social media has basically made folks ""admit guilt"" prior to having a conversation with a lawyer and realisticslly..popular rich people probably arent the most appropriate"
7900,2020-06-28 20:25:53,hh8xbg,But it‚Äôs created a negative witch hunt to try to find the alleged victim and put them which is so wrong. If this is true? It is not tea and is serious. Beyond the Internet serious.
7901,2020-06-28 21:12:09,hh8xbg,yeah on her instagram story she basically said she didnt know what to think of shane anymore and she started crying so im pretty sure shes anti-shane now
7902,2020-06-28 22:19:47,hh8xbg,"Jeffree brought up the exact same voice memos earlier this year when the heat was on him with davhvie. But then he said he wasn‚Äôt even sure if it was true or not whatever was in it.

So I‚Äôm shocked the exact same thing a month later, people think it‚Äôs true. Manipulation tactics by Jeffree just to deflect heat back onto James. These are more than a year old and nothing materialized. I don‚Äôt believe anything Jeffree orchestrates"
7903,2020-06-28 16:23:26,hh8xbg,I say this a white girl. I am disgusted by myself for supporting him in the past. I am even more disgusted by those who still try to forgive him these days
7904,2020-06-28 06:27:19,hh8xbg,So are shame stans using that to deflect/distract or do you think just regular conspiracy nuts?
7905,2020-06-28 10:22:37,hh8xbg,"As far as I can find he was on the Little Black Book which is just an address/phone book, not a flight log (which was also leaked). 

Epstein was incredibly well connected and he most likely had anyone he met or could contact as a friend of a friend on that book in case he needed it later. I don't understand why people have jumped on it as a sign of anything."
7906,2020-06-28 07:37:25,hh8xbg,Wtf
7907,2020-06-28 12:20:01,hh8xbg,"The second he says anything he‚Äôll get eaten alive (again) too. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs keeping himself busy with his 100, 102, 103, and 104 year old grandmas. /s"
7908,2020-06-28 12:06:27,hh8xbg,"Jeffree may have bought some time, but his time IS coming. Both Shane and Jeffree have dirt on each other, its a game of chicken to see who breaks first and releases it. Shane will release it to get the heat off of himself, and amd Jeffree will release it to try and distance himself."
7909,2020-06-28 12:55:38,hh8xbg,"Ooh that‚Äôs a good point, here‚Äôs to hoping that Jemima doesn‚Äôt escape without any repercussions for once"
7910,2020-06-28 13:17:50,hh8xbg,"although his collab with Manny didn't stop him turning on him, I suppose it wasn't as big a collab though. Jeffree is smart though, I suspect there are things in their contract to protect him in a situation like this"

7927,2020-06-30 01:05:02,hh8xbg,Plus the NY Times article...that's a big deal right
7928,2020-06-28 13:17:30,hh8xbg,Yeah exactly! I hate that excuse so much cuz racist and p*do jokes were NEVER okay.
7929,2020-06-28 13:12:30,hh8xbg,I hate when people use ‚Äúit was a different time back then‚Äù as an excuse for ANYTHING. Like people were against racism during slavery too. People were outright against slaves. People were against nazis too and tried to save Jewish people. There are so many influential people who did stand up for what‚Äôs right at that time. It‚Äôs BS to say morality depends on time and context.
7930,2020-06-28 13:32:26,hh8xbg,"Wow, no. I am about his age and while there were plenty of edgy jokes that wouldn't be made this day, somehow most people got by without involving minors. 

Racist jokes/mental health jokes were a bit more common, but usually the one saying the joke... was part of the joke."
7931,2020-06-28 23:25:48,hh8xbg,Oh you‚Äôre definitely right! I just thought it was always creepy that he did it.
7932,2020-06-29 00:19:25,hh8xbg,Didn‚Äôt simplynailogical or someone get a copyright thing from Taylor too for doing a parody song of it when painting glittery blood nails or something ? I vaguely remember that
7933,2020-06-29 22:38:56,hh8xbg,Beast!
7934,2020-06-30 04:16:41,hh8xbg,"Yeah- I stopped drinking about 5 and a half years ago now; for like health reasons (it flared my pelvic pain from Endo and Adenomyosis); and for a lot of other reasons, but for me that was the biggest one.

But yeh- like... it‚Äôs such an odd lie. I feel it‚Äôs way more commendable to say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt drink any more‚Äù as compared to ‚ÄúI have never touched alcohol in my life, why would I lie about something as silly as alcohol?‚Äù (He tweeted that when questioned about it a while ago).

Also! Congratulations on your sobriety- I know I don‚Äôt know you; but I‚Äôm proud of you!"
7935,2020-06-28 19:12:29,hh8xbg,Lol I felt pretty gross typing them out üòÇ
7936,2020-06-29 14:46:31,hh8xbg,Because he kick started this latest round of drama and wants to cash in on it as much as possible just like all these other tea channels
7937,2020-06-29 14:31:32,hh8xbg,"Actually, this had me thinking. Have you seen the latest Sanders Kennedy videos? He openly talks about doing a big project with a lot of known youtubers (I think) about jeffree star..."
7938,2020-06-28 12:49:27,hh8xbg,Seems like she is also going to to talk about what ever info J* has about James Charles.
7939,2020-06-28 15:20:09,hh8xbg,But Shane is so poor didn't you know???
7940,2020-06-28 15:18:29,hh8xbg,A lot of Hollywood men have stayed around for much longer for much worse.

7942,2020-06-28 20:11:55,hh8xbg,Blaire didn‚Äôt play that part...
7943,2020-06-28 20:37:08,hh8xbg,She‚Äôs coming out with a Shane Dawson predatory behaviour video. She‚Äôs definitely not trying to take heat off of him.
7944,2020-06-28 20:32:12,hh8xbg,"Ahh i forgot about them but maybe? Ashlye seems to be still being okay with JC on Twitter?  So idk.

I'm like if we just believe it then its like dramaggedon 2.

It reminds me why everyone did because these allegations weren't simply some petty tea ... it was serious and is more than just drama which is why everyone turned in james so quickly.


Edit (again- added another tweet):

Just saw this on twitter that ashlye posted on 2 tweets

>And what is fucked up now is when I did my video, I believed Jeffree had been lying. Now hearing Blair say she heard it for herself, now I‚Äôm even more fucked up. I don‚Äôt know what to believe.

>I‚Äôve stated multiple times I knew about the voice note but I never heard it myself. It was hearsay for me. But I believed he had it. And it wasn‚Äôt my story to tell. And after so much time went by I started having my doubts whether he was lying or not. But no, I never heard it.

So atleast for her it seems she never heard the voice memo but rather heard that it exists and heard what it is about....without actually hearing it...

Not sure about sanders tho"
7945,2020-06-28 20:35:42,hh8xbg,But didn‚Äôt say whether or not that person responded.
7946,2020-06-28 20:30:10,hh8xbg,Why would the dude who runs Drama Alert want to stay out of drama? Like. Literally inserting himself into other people's drama is his entire schtick.
7947,2020-06-28 20:28:02,hh8xbg,Keem is 100% a horrible person but I feel like he would want to make a video saying he heard it for those views no?
7948,2020-06-28 20:31:42,hh8xbg,Im surprised that J\* didn't show them seen as he's so keen on showing everyone apparently. Blaire White claimed on her story that more yters came to her and said they've also heard the voice memo so I wish more people spoke out about it.
7949,2020-06-28 20:24:51,hh8xbg,yeah I didn't initially think this what he was referring to but he could be trying to be sneaky.
7950,2020-06-28 20:44:33,hh8xbg,"keem is known for falsely accusing youtubers of pedophilia and sexual assault (happened at least twice iirc) so i doubt he would b the one the break the news even if he did hear the memo bc he wouldnt want to b seen as falsely accusing another youtuber, especially one with such a huge following."
7951,2020-06-28 20:26:50,hh8xbg,He really needs to clarify because this could be huge information.
7952,2020-06-29 01:41:18,hh8xbg,She literally disavowed Shane in the same video and on Instagram. You can dislike more than one person at the same time.
7953,2020-06-29 02:53:33,hh8xbg,The clips are amazing and what got me interested. Now I‚Äôm genuinely into the series and watching Stinky Dumpster make awful decisions.
7954,2020-06-29 08:20:23,hh8xbg,"not only that, it‚Äôs just so uncomfortable to see a platform on which so many people rely on and engage with daily, for years on end, have people on the top who have created narratives that successfully manipulated literally millions of people and taken the money from their pockets. shit is so evil. it‚Äôs not different from the behavior you see in other forms of media or society overall. like, we come to youtube to feel better, or learn, or relate to somebody... not to witness people burning to the ground. just so disheartening and depressing"

All I‚Äôm saying is, the timing of everything is too dang perfect to deflect heat off Jeffree.

It always goes back to Jeffree. 

But this isn‚Äôt about outing a victim. We are soooo close to finally exposing Jeffree for the vile trash bag he is and need to divert attention back to him."

8089,2020-06-29 00:57:59,hh8xbg,"Do not bring that energy into the world. Ned Fulmer is my perfect cinnamon roll and Eugene and Matt are the Gay Excellence, I will not have that taken"
8090,2020-06-29 03:56:31,hh8xbg,"I didn‚Äôt think ab this angle but I see exactly what you mean, he put his foot in his mouth with the twitter apology trying to still mask his bad behavior with ‚Äúhumor‚Äù and disrespecting an entire YT community. That really speeded up the trajectory of his downfall."
8091,2020-06-29 03:39:29,hh8xbg,From a PR standpoint what would have been the best thing to do after the I‚Äôm leaving the community post?
8092,2020-06-29 18:53:24,hh8xbg,Uh I forgot about his ridiculous sob story that he doesn‚Äôt make much money ... all said whilst in in a mansion
8093,2020-06-29 17:07:56,hh8xbg,üëÅ Shane Yaw ü§† my ‚úÖ name!!
8094,2020-06-29 20:19:35,hh8xbg,Please give me the name for this üòÇüòÇ
8095,2020-06-30 01:30:09,hh8xbg,Drives me crazy when they do that. It‚Äôs such lazy reporting. WaPo did it right though.
8096,2020-06-30 01:34:10,hh8xbg,He's outing which victims spoke up.
8097,2020-06-30 02:50:09,hh8xbg,"Ahhhh gotcha, I didn‚Äôt see it listed in any of the megathreads"
8098,2020-06-30 02:51:42,hh8xbg,He definitely brightened that woman‚Äôs day. I‚Äôm so glad he answered her!!
8099,2020-06-30 02:42:49,hh8xbg,"Yes, I agree. He is too much of a perfect angel!!"
8100,2020-06-30 02:54:41,hh8xbg,"""Manipulative bullies who try to smother our spirits"". I'm sorry but if you've watched every collab between Shitstain Doodieson & Garrett Watts like me, you know this is some major shade

Literally anytime time Garrett brought up Harry Potter, video games, Marvel movies, or other ""nerdy"" things, Shitstain would immediately get annoyed and shut him down. Garrett usually plays it off as a joke but you know he knows it's not a joke. Yeah, not sure how long friendships last whenever one's passions are always dismissed by the other"
8101,2020-06-30 03:38:11,hh8xbg,"This is also just how Garrett always is, so it might not be related at all"
8102,2020-06-30 03:23:10,hh8xbg,"This is the thing... you can interpret everything he's posted both ways. I'll be so fucking sad if it turns out he's been defending Shane's behavior instead, I genuinely adore Garrett."
8103,2020-06-30 03:32:16,hh8xbg,"I love Coco Peru. Honestly she puts RuPaul to shame, I wish we could replace him with her. Show some of the younger kids what a real LGBTQ+ icon who actually advocates for the whole community look like."
8104,2020-06-30 03:34:09,hh8xbg,"""That bothers me"""
8105,2020-06-30 03:44:41,hh8xbg,"I very much want to be his friend and enable each other's awful sleep schedules and hoarding and loving things too much, then I can bring the bitchy smart ass side and fight anyone who even THINKS about blocking his shine, and he can remind me to let things go bc we aint got time for that negativity when there are more important things like helping turtles cross the road and driving around to awwww at all the puppies we see"
8106,2020-06-30 02:53:13,hh8xbg,I would totally date Garrett if he were into women lol. He‚Äôs such a sweetheart. I only get good vibes from him.
8107,2020-06-30 02:47:11,hh8xbg,"prob since not long after Shart crawled inside jingleheimer schmitt's asshole to create a shrine. 
I think he got distance when he went to Japan,  when he was in the last shart video I thought he looked uncomfortable and like he had already started to see he didn't wanna belong but maybe that's just me seeing what I want bc honestly shane and co never deserved Garrett.  I will admit I think he and Morgan could have been genuine friends if she wasn't related to Ryland

edit: also can you imagine being around shart as he's  infatuated with jingleheimer?  *shudder"
8108,2020-06-30 02:48:06,hh8xbg,"Garrett and Shane haven‚Äôt been in many videos together for a while now (I think Garrett made a brief appearance in the docuseries about the Conspiracy palette, but that‚Äôs basically it) and there‚Äôs been some speculation about them not being friends, but Garrett has also posted some kinda vague things that can be interpreted as shade toward Shane."
8109,2020-06-28 20:03:07,hh8xbg,Wasn‚Äôt it nick that just yesterday said he didn‚Äôt want to do a video on the shane Dawson stuff because of the serious content?? Is this different or just work better for the narrative he wants to spin?
8110,2020-06-29 19:06:56,hh8xbg,"Ugh I know! I feel like I was following all the drama channels during the last dramageddon and all the click bait and false promo was so annoying I unfollowed all of them, but now I‚Äôm in this again so here we go."
8111,2020-06-29 20:11:43,hh8xbg,One thing I‚Äôm hoping is that tea channels put more pressure on morphe cause fuck them on being silent.
8112,2020-06-28 10:24:20,hh8xbg,"And if that‚Äôs what he was like in front of the camera, imagine what he‚Äôs like behind closed doors."
8113,2020-06-28 10:35:21,hh8xbg,"They're doing some sort of challenge where they draw topics out of a bowl and have to talk shit about it. Shane draws ""Trayvon Martin,"" there's palpable tension. Quick edit and then Shane says, ""Maybe you wouldn't have been walking home alone if you'd had a job."" He then exclaims, ""It's the game!"""
8114,2020-06-28 10:50:18,hh8xbg,Shane said ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt be walking around the street if you had a job‚Äù. He took the name out of a hat and immediately started laughing.
8115,2020-06-28 11:12:06,hh8xbg,"He said 'maybe he wouldn't have been walking down the street if he had a job' or something, cracking up laughing the whole time like he's hilarious. Really unfunny, pathetic and immature."
8116,2020-06-28 13:21:44,hh8xbg,Wait what. Did she say that?
8117,2020-06-28 13:26:19,hh8xbg,[deleted]
8118,2020-06-28 14:46:32,hh8xbg,"This is not ok. I understand his demographic is youunngg, but if the wiggles started humping their fans I truly doubt people would make the same excuses. 

I really hope that these kids have the strength,support and fortitude to report this. Im beyond heartbroken as an adult that these kiddos have been hurt and betrayed by adults. Especially one that they looked up to. I have no words."
8119,2020-06-28 14:50:58,hh8xbg,"There definitely needs to be a legal reckoning of some sort via investigation. However it shakes out.

Obviously a social reckoning won‚Äôt matter since his friends cohort with others behaving similarly. 
Worst case he is a perpetrator but becomes more sly. 
I truly shudder to think if he was doing this on the web for all to see, what didn‚Äôt he show the world."
8120,2020-06-29 08:36:20,hh8xbg,The claims of being an empath are absolutely false if you consider that he only seems to have empathy for other racists and anyone he hurts isn't even an afterthought.

8122,2020-06-29 21:42:39,hh8xbg,"Anyone know how old he is? I'm always so impressed with his maturity level and production value, he's really good at what he does"
8123,2020-06-29 16:31:20,hh8xbg,That picture absolutely exists I saw it yesterday in (I think???) the Shane Dawson sub.
8124,2020-06-29 17:10:45,hh8xbg,"There‚Äôs a video I remember of them showing Shane‚Äôs new merch and one of them is a shanaynay shirt

Edit: 5.08 in this video they‚Äôre looking at the t shirts https://youtu.be/pH_Zq1ZS7O8 

I swear there‚Äôs another where they hold it up I have a memory of it but you can still see the shanaynay shirt"
8125,2020-06-29 16:35:57,hh8xbg,"I agree, if my brother was dating someone like that I‚Äôd distance myself completely. But that‚Äôs just me and my brother doesn‚Äôt sign my pay checks. As a sister I also think itd be my business as a sister to take my brother aside and be like yo listen bitch this girl (boy in rylands case) is no good, I‚Äôm mortified for ryland and Morgan‚Äôs parents, could you imagine finding all this out? I doubt they watched any Shane videos especially before ryland and Shane got together.


Trisha is still not canceled and standing by Shane so...

And standing by Shane I mean posting other you tubers being problematic to get people off of Shane‚Äôs back... she needs to be done too"
8126,2020-06-29 17:00:52,hh8xbg,"I know Ryland has stated he had no idea who Shame was when they met. But, after you find out he does YouTube for a living, wouldn't you check out past content?"
8127,2020-06-29 18:48:47,hh8xbg,"I guess I should clarify (in case it came off as me saying that's what needs to happen), but I definitely didn't mean that I was expecting Ryland to suddenly leave Shane with everything that's come up. The point I was trying to make was there is no way he wasn't aware of all of this stuff before hand, or even other types of behaviors and opinions behind closed doors, so I have a hard time thinking he is 100% innocent.

Some (not all) are treating this as if Ryland was completely blindsided when I doubt that's the case at all. When I mention choosing to support him, I meant even before all of this resurfaced. That's what I was basing my judgment and confusion on. 

I acknowledge I don't know enough about him, but at the same time there is nothing that leads me to believe he isn't okay with Shane's choices and behavior this entire time (not just now)."
8128,2020-06-29 17:08:54,hh8xbg,"Why is it always minor celebrities treat others like that, when they‚Äôre not actually that famous"
8129,2020-06-29 16:11:53,hh8xbg,"[Here‚Äôs the video](https://youtu.be/oQcKOmDsJe4), she says that he‚Äôs an overall shitty person, treats people he works with like shit and allegedly didn‚Äôt pay the artist who did a few sketches for his JSC logo when he was starting his company. She‚Äôs obviously full of shit as much as Jeffree, so the point isn‚Äôt what she‚Äôs accusing him of, it‚Äôs more the fact that when I first saw that video I couldn‚Äôt believe that Jafar was a bad person or that he would scam somebody but turns out that he IS a shitty person and the scamming situation might have been true ü§°

Edit: my last sentence was unclear"
8130,2020-06-29 16:08:12,hh8xbg,"I could be wrong, but I think she accused him of not paying the designer that did his logo"
8131,2020-06-29 22:01:40,hh8xbg,Love this

8134,2020-06-29 02:44:49,hh8xbg,I missed the taylor swift one! What did she say
8135,2020-06-29 02:19:56,hh8xbg,"The Smiths are a band and they have zero to do with this drama. Can *everyone* just say the Smith family if referencing Jada, Jaden, Willow,and Will?"
8136,2020-06-29 01:52:51,hh8xbg,I'm only a few episodes in but it's just something you have to watch every episode to catch the gist of what is going on. It is so bad that it's good
8137,2020-06-29 02:04:27,hh8xbg,It used to be on Tubi for free!
8138,2020-06-29 02:49:58,hh8xbg,It‚Äôs free on the tubi app.
8139,2020-06-29 02:08:39,hh8xbg,"You have to buy the episodes. I wouldnt pay for them to be honest, I just had a gift certificate that I wasnt going to spend on anything else"
8140,2020-06-28 15:30:18,hh8xbg,Yet I did a video about Botox and it was flagged and demobilized.
8141,2020-06-28 13:54:59,hh8xbg,UGH! That's some Epstein-level shit right there.
8142,2020-06-28 14:01:05,hh8xbg,"Agree. I don't think Will has to ""go after"" YouTube per se but twist their arm/partner and turn this into something positive. I can see him and Jada totally doing some behind the scenes stuff to make this right.

This whole thing makes me so sick."
8143,2020-06-28 13:57:31,hh8xbg,"I agree 100%. Clickbait and controversies = $$$, but just because it's always been that way doesn't mean it has to stay that way? With everything going in the world, enough is enough."
8144,2020-06-29 17:41:36,hh8xbg,"I think the very bottom numbers only go from $0.25-$4.00 or something? 

It's the daily rows you want to look at. He made between $1400-$23k (!!) yesterday."
8145,2020-06-30 02:31:09,hh8xbg,If he didn‚Äôt have Nate do an NDA he‚Äôs dumb.
8146,2020-06-28 07:01:03,hh8xbg,i‚Äôm very worried it has already escalated further and we just don‚Äôt know
8147,2020-06-28 06:50:35,hh8xbg,"If you look into the replies of jadens tweet you'll see the video of willow, i think that's actually what brought them in"
8148,2020-06-28 14:09:49,hh8xbg,Not shame
8149,2020-06-28 13:29:16,hh8xbg,Oh Peter. I think it‚Äôs funny how the times he ask for no drama that‚Äôs when all the drama happens. It‚Äôs like he is personally getting gifts from the drama gods. He has a wedding anniversary the drama gods gave us Shane‚Äôs apology. He‚Äôs birthday is coming up and I wonder what gift he will receive ü§î
8150,2020-06-28 14:12:43,hh8xbg,"-157,638,554 views OUCH. Also comments turned off on youtube."
8151,2020-06-28 14:27:08,hh8xbg,"She took off everything with Shane, I remember the music parody videos that were not offensive as far as I can remember (Shake it off parody) and it's gone now. Wow."
8152,2020-06-28 15:52:00,hh8xbg,Agreed. I think one way to accurately determine how much he's actually lost is to see how many views he loses once he goes back to regular/non drama related videos.
8153,2020-06-28 14:55:46,hh8xbg,"Bleh, the twitter one is still live.

YouTube fully changed how it reports numbers after last year.

All I‚Äôm saying is, Shane deserves to lose a lot more because there is so much vile and nasty crap that constantly keeps coming out."
8154,2020-06-28 15:47:04,hh8xbg,"Just speaking for myself but like I genuinely don't know who/who I'm not subscribed to (I know I can check but like I do so rarely) on the new YouTube because the recommended page basically is who I watch. I'm always surprised when I go to my subscriptions and realise who I'm subscribed to (the latest was Colleen when I rarely watched her and so when I realised I unsubbed, this was a couple weeks after her drama). So might be lazy people like me. Plus he posts so rarely I'd forget."
8155,2020-06-28 19:20:04,hh8xbg,I'm sure Andrew has some footage.

8157,2020-06-28 19:31:32,hh8xbg,Honestly yeah shame needs to just burn that bridge with him and take jarjar stinks out with him. Hes not sticking up for his ‚Äúfriend‚Äù in return. If your gonna go out best be going out swinging and burning it all down
8158,2020-06-28 19:20:17,hh8xbg,"lol no way, somehow jingleheimer would record shame's blackmail attempt and expose him as confirmation of how shitty he is. the snake would slither again."
8159,2020-06-28 19:24:47,hh8xbg,"Shane isn‚Äôt smart, though"
8160,2020-06-28 21:22:16,hh8xbg,"The info, the ‚Äúdirt‚Äù that Jstar uses on people."
8161,2020-06-29 11:44:24,hh8xbg,"They're not getting a lot of heat for this incident, no. But [this is a very interesting read](https://nirnewrites.com/2020/06/17/fbe-a-brief-summary-of-terrible-things/). They are getting called out by old staff and cast members and a lot are quitting for many things, mostly racism in their company."
8162,2020-06-29 16:46:47,hh8xbg,Nothing would have happened if he hadn't stirred things up in Keemstar mom's basement interview

8164,2020-06-30 03:19:00,hh8xbg,I felt the exact same as you! Really irritated me that she believed J* over James but I'm glad she's now figured it out.
8165,2020-06-30 02:29:05,hh8xbg,"Yes! I really appreciated her honesty. And I know what it's like to feel ""betrayed"" by celebrity bullshit (R. Kelly, as she mentions, was also a rough one for me), so I related to her feelings. 

She just put a lot of time into it and it shows."
8166,2020-06-30 02:29:37,hh8xbg,I just found her today! I was looking for more Joe Exotic gossip lmao and came across her video on him. I've been binging since - she's great!
8167,2020-06-28 06:46:49,hh8xbg,"Shane‚Äôs the type of dipshit who still likes being called a nice guy by everyone who knows him. If he had Jeffree‚Äôs or PewDiePie‚Äôs ‚Äúfck it, imma stick to people who live for my shitty edgelord behavior‚Äù attitude, he‚Äôd be able to skate along just fine within his own ‚Äúniche‚Äù no matter how small or insignificant it is. 

He lives for constant approval, validation and adulation from others. I have very little faith in him that he‚Äôd be able to walk away from this way the way others have."
8168,2020-06-28 06:48:05,hh8xbg,Do you really believe he'll actually get cancelled? I saw a bunch of positive feedback to Shane after the apology video both on youtube and on Twitter
8169,2020-06-28 06:51:41,hh8xbg,"Shane‚Äôs very negative and at the same time obsessed with people not only liking him, but seeing him as a nice and relatable guy. Even on a purely business stand point that‚Äôs going to eventually mess up whatever chances he has in surviving this."
8170,2020-06-28 10:35:52,hh8xbg,Same!! She seems to enjoy this a lot and threatens to ‚Äúleak‚Äù stuff. She‚Äôs becoming Jevfefe
8171,2020-06-28 13:48:48,hh8xbg,Thank you so much and shoutout to Hannah Montana! üíï
8172,2020-06-28 22:30:19,hh8xbg,"The way he turned it into ""stop spreading photos of my self harm!"" Was really fucking gross."
8173,2020-06-29 00:11:09,hh8xbg,"He seems drained. He used to be a Shane fan a couple of years back, IIRC, and it sucks to see someone you liked turn out to be a shitty person even if you've already washed your hands of them. Especially when you've spoken to them in person on friendly terms. 

Hopefully he can enjoy his birthday tomorrow and have a good time away from the drama! And lol the short intro was immediate ""what's happening, something is very wrong"" territory for me."
8174,2020-06-29 00:10:19,hh8xbg,Poor Peter..
8175,2020-06-29 00:38:12,hh8xbg,he and blair never met in person so he had to send it to her somehow.
8176,2020-06-29 17:09:31,hh8xbg,A lot of the comments I‚Äôve seen replying to those threads is people saying they used to watch them as a kid and think it was funny and had no idea how awful it was
8177,2020-06-29 16:48:02,hh8xbg,"The whole damaging children argument didn't really occur to me before this whole thing blew up but it makes sense. Someone on the Twitter thread said that this was how ththey learned what porn was, at 10 years old. That's so gross and not ok

I still can't sleep at night for some stuff I did or said when I was a child. But the difference between me and Shane is that I would have done anything to remedy what I did if I had the opportunity. Shane has had his opportunity multiple times now and he just sweeps stuff under the rug, not addressing anything worthwhile at all. He just does the bare minimum to redeem himself. Also I agree pedophilic shit should never have been tolerated and I have no idea how it was tolerated."

Dogwhistling is a strategy in communication where the general public will not understand it, but a certain group of people/ demographic will be aware of the secret message being sent

i.e 
someone uses #XYZ in their post
we dont see it as problematic
a certain group of people that fetishize XYZ use it to find content related to it or to find each other"

I didn't watch that one so just going off what I read. This one I just watched and he is purposely playing the 'best' parts of all 3 of Shane's apologies. 

Don't take the thumbnail to mean anything because in this video Phil is fully and blatantly attempting to help Shane with this super cut of Shane 'apologize out of fear' Dawson bullshittery. He's saying the response was positive and basing it off the likes vs dislikes, leaving out any mention of the mass censoring of his comments, and saying it only turned negative after the Smith's spoke out on Twitter. He declined to give any of his opinions whatsoever other than calling the minor stuff 'disturbing'. He's cash grabbing and manipulating his audience to believe Shane. He's a massive piece of shit."

8268,2020-06-28 20:26:49,hh8xbg,"I don't wanna give out her name that she was born with or her username that she went by before she transitioned but she used to be part of this group of Jeffree Star wannabes who called themselves ""androgynous"" who basically copied everything that Jeffree Star used to do. Her username was basically ___her pervious name____f*****(insult for gay men)-tron, similar to what Jeffree used to call himself in the past.
Jeffree at that time called himself ""something inbetween"" because he didn't want to be in the same category as gay men or trans people so he called himself Androgynous. That Yuki Damon person who leaked a bunch of old Jeffree videos used to be one of them. Incase anybody wants proof i think it can be easily found with a simple google search."

8272,2020-06-28 20:33:29,hh8xbg,"Lol she wasnt't ""just a fan"" she was a living copy of him lol, i knew of her before she became the person that she is now, if u don't belive me, just google.. And yes she was on Jameses side at the time when Tati dropped her first video but not too long after that she spoke badly of James during her live streams, similar as she talks about Kim Petras.

in this case, she said that when she searched for her name, it mostly appeared drama videos and people talking about her bf her content (and her channel still appeared tho).

If I was Willow I wouldnt be able to hear that song again. It sounds dramatic, I know, but as a survivor of SA any reminder can throw you back to the feeling of helplessness and victimhood. 

I'm aware she wasnt assaulted, but to see a grown man jacking off to you? That has to be hard."

8282,2020-06-28 18:47:49,hh8xbg,All this video did was shift the attention away from Shane and J*'s problematic and racist behaviour.
8283,2020-06-28 22:20:06,hh8xbg,"Exactly... and as if Jeffree would care enough about victims of SA to expose a predator, when he himself has done worse and was friends with a literal pedophile (Dahvie). What I think truly happened is that Jeffree got this voice memo, and decided to believe it, not because it made sense to him or anything, but because it's about James and he saw the perfect opportunity to use it against him and take him down. And now he won't let it go which is gross. I really don't believe this voice memo is legit, only that Jeffree hopes and wants it to be real. Because it's ""so deep and dark"" as he'd say... eye roll"
8284,2020-06-28 22:39:28,hh8xbg,This is the same reason why Keem has been cancel-proof despite being cancelled nonstop.
8285,2020-06-29 00:25:21,hh8xbg,"A few commentary channels have picked up a story about Jeffree having investment in Morphe, so I sorta see that one being a bit of a lost cause. That being said, I‚Äôm still for trying. 

Also thinking about other stockists like BeautyBay and Beautylish. Like, I know it would suck really badly for them discontinuing stock. BB is still selling summer 2018 stuff at full price, I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs 2 year old stock and about to expire. They may not be able to take a hit on the stock they already have, but they could quietly choose not to buy collections in the future."

8298,2020-06-29 13:50:46,hh8xbg,"JC may have asked him not to... idk. Since it‚Äôs still a random youtuber bringing it up, and not JS or SD themselves, maybe James is hoping they keep imploding and eventually expose themselves? Bringing it up would be falling into their trap"

8303,2020-06-29 07:50:55,hh8xbg,"Look at how many people were outright lying about him assaulting them last year. 

Blaire says this accuser is credible, yet James was called a predator by a credible person last year too, Tati. And just look at how much she outright lied when doing so.

Honestly, I think the person who sent this voice memo is either lying or they are making the situation out to be far worse then what actually happened."
8304,2020-06-29 08:50:51,hh8xbg,"He did name names of the people jeffree said had accused him but didn't even know who one of them was, one was the waiter that thought he was gay then kept going back and forth, and i think one might've been a Dolan but James said the dolans checked up on him after drammageddon 2, i watched the video like 2 days ago so hopefully that's right"

It doesn't mean anything to evidence brought from other parties into the suit."
8321,2020-06-28 19:42:16,hh8xbg,Miranda rights are only about what you say while being arrested/in police custody.
8322,2020-06-29 01:40:24,hh8xbg,"Jaclyn was absolutely right to make the Eugenia video, and I respect her a lot for it. I don't like that she's friends with Blaire, but she has addressed that numerous times. She doesn't agree with all of Blaire's views but I don't know why people expect others to only be friends with someone that agrees with them in every aspect. They can challenge each other's views which they do.

While it may not have been his intention, Shane's video about Eugenia glossed over all the shit to give her a perfect recovery story and ignored the fact that Eugenia was still in a very dangerous situation. Everything in Jaclyn's video is true, even Eugenia herself touches on the events in the video she made with Kati Morton. I don't believe it was reactionary at all. If people started thinking she was fine then they would stop trying to help her."

My point is that the silence gives me chills along my spine. Jada's tweet read to me as ""Game over, stink. I'm coming for you"" and she shut her laptop and just made calls and is bringing hell upon Shane. Does that explain it better?"
8351,2020-06-28 13:17:48,hh8xbg,"Highly doubt Ryland would leave Shane given the mansion and amount of money he got from the palette. The amount of times Ryland ""joked"" about how rich they'll be after the palette release makes me think he doesn't care about reputation as much as wealth.

Shane loves to say ""I deserve to lose everything"" without actually having done anything publicly with his earnings. If he truly wanted to show he changed through his actions, he would donate money earned from his palette or deleted videos to charity or towards the BLM movement.

But of course he thinks a simple apology is enough to reap all the benefits of his dirty money."

Also she said on her twitter that she‚Äôs fed up with yt and censorship so she‚Äôll look into another platform (though she may have just said it because she was pissed)"

8374,2020-06-30 02:27:26,hh8xbg,"Lmao I had this exact reaction, but it turns out this is the exact reason he was trending - people are all saying how great he is and how he deserved better.

I still feel like he's maybe not loving the attention, mind you, but at least it seems overwhelmingly positive."
8375,2020-06-28 11:23:02,hh8xbg,Not a fan of him but I don‚Äôt think it was proved he actually looted? I thought he got caught for trespassing or something

8379,2020-06-28 07:03:47,hh8xbg,what really gets me is that YouTube let those videos stay up that long.

8382,2020-06-28 16:25:21,hh8xbg,"I agree. Plenty of people change priorities when they get married. And she seems like a perfectionist who'd prefer putting out a well-made video that takes days to film and edit. If she's occupied with other things in her life, then that's more difficult to do."
8383,2020-06-28 15:17:37,hh8xbg,"Really?? I didn‚Äôt get that vibe from her, every video had so much work, effort, knowledge and entertainment. Seems like she had endless ideas for creative videos that are really a niche for her. I only got into her maybe 2 yrs ago and steadily watched all her videos but not really in any type of order, so I guess I didn‚Äôt pick up that pattern."
8384,2020-06-28 15:43:03,hh8xbg,"Yes she‚Äôs pretty private about that, but she‚Äôs really good friends with Christina. But Shane and Jenna and Christina and their partners were at her wedding."
8385,2020-06-28 16:40:08,hh8xbg,"I've always looked at YouTubers who are friends as work friends. They'd go to each other's weddings and funerals because it's polite and good to maintain relationships with these people. Plus, they're all within the same age bracket so they naturally gravitated towards each other. I'd invite my work friends to my wedding but if they fucked up, I'm not getting dragged into their mess.

It's Cristine and Ben who were clearly hurt when Rob almost died. They kept flying to the Threadbangers' to support to Corinne."
8386,2020-06-28 15:22:47,hh8xbg,Yeah she definitely didn‚Äôt have a routine schedule down. But it was always 2 to 3 videos per month.

8388,2020-06-28 15:22:01,hh8xbg,"That could be true, one of the few videos she‚Äôs put out this year was combining a bunch of stuff from other unmade videos. 

Sorry but I fully disagree with your feelings on her content. I absolutely love those videos. She has absolutely no shame and will go out in the kookiest outfits and give real reviews on what she‚Äôs wearing. With interesting historical fashion facts and tidbits peppered in."
8389,2020-06-28 16:06:37,hh8xbg,"No, you misunderstood. I‚Äôve just been wondering where she is lately! Not why she hasn‚Äôt put out a video addressing anything specific about these cretins."

None of it changes the fact that J* is a pos."
8408,2020-06-28 17:36:14,hh8xbg,"Maybe, but he is also opening himself up to more legal trouble if that was what shut him up to start with and that brings me back to the question of what his end game actually is. I mean, it's pretty clear he's out to take out rivals, but why go back to a strategy that already failed? That makes no sense to me."
8409,2020-06-28 17:45:41,hh8xbg,"I see your point but I keep coming back to the legal angle and how much hot water he was in last year over the allegations he made. He shut up so fast last year and I suspect it was because he really doesn't have a leg to stand on, even if the allegations are true because of how difficult it would be to prove. He wasn't doing himself any favors but maybe he didn't see it that way? I dunno and honestly I don't think I want to delve too deeply into that mind."
8410,2020-06-29 02:51:38,hh8xbg,I don‚Äôt think he did anything? He broke quarantine to hang out with a drag star but that was at least a month ago. I think he‚Äôs been mentioned because Jonkle Stonk said he had that voice memo relating to the last Dramagedon

8412,2020-06-29 02:48:16,hh8xbg,I think they mean like people started the week pissed about his role in the JC drama last year and now it's so much bigger than that and his entire fucked up past has been brought out.

Shane should have zero hope of being forgiven.

He should wish to be forgotten.

8421,2020-06-29 15:14:23,hh8xbg,I think at this point he's better off staying silent and hoping to be forgotten.

8423,2020-06-29 13:18:24,hh8xbg,Yeah Lisa cosigned everything Shane did so I don‚Äôt feel sorry for her at all. I‚Äôm legitimately surprised she unfollowed him since she‚Äôs always talked about how he‚Äôs family. Hope she‚Äôs held accountable for her part too.
8424,2020-06-29 14:57:40,hh8xbg,"No, I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm asking the question. Didn‚Äôt she sign some agreement saying she wouldn‚Äôt discuss it? Didn‚Äôt Jeffree too? It was supposedly some meeting with mediators? I don‚Äôt know, but I‚Äôve heard that was the case."

8428,2020-06-28 19:49:32,hh8xbg,"Yeah, I'm really scratching my head at all these people who apparently think that her video 'helps' him. If that's helping, I'd hate to see what she'd do if she was going after him."
8429,2020-06-28 19:52:39,hh8xbg,"It doesn‚Äôt make him look great, but it absolves him of trying to ruin a 19 year old for no reason. And she‚Äôs acting like he‚Äôs going to kill her for saying he‚Äôs a gossip? He admits to worse stuff than that. It all feels very disingenuous to me."
8430,2020-06-28 19:54:48,hh8xbg,"He's already made that known about himself. It's a ""drama"" he knows he can weather when this happened last year."
8431,2020-06-28 20:06:50,hh8xbg,"He only wants someone else to come out and validates his old claim about James Charles. As long as it doesn't come out of his mouth, he thinks he's safe. He's THAT desperate to stir the narrative."
8432,2020-06-28 19:53:46,hh8xbg,"Because it gives credibility to J* assertion that James is a predator and even if it makes J* look bad right now, he could have a plan to spin it around to make himself look good: That he was genuinely concerned about what James allegedly did and couldn‚Äôt keep his mouth shut about it.

8434,2020-06-29 09:30:32,hh8xbg,"I think he said it, because he wanted James to call him and ask him what he has. So he faked some kind of receipts and posted it to Blair White out of all people later, because he knew she would spill."
8435,2020-06-29 09:28:09,hh8xbg,Exactly! The absurdity.
8436,2020-06-29 09:27:15,hh8xbg,Yeahhhh nah
8437,2020-06-29 19:59:39,hh8xbg,Noice
8438,2020-06-28 20:30:13,hh8xbg,"Even if there is a memo, there is no evidence it's legit. Jeffree has been seeding false narratives since the beginning of the Dramageddons. Remember ""Manny is a social climber""?"
8439,2020-06-28 20:38:04,hh8xbg,"She‚Äôs known for flirting with alt-right ideologies. She has made racist comments, and spews harmful ideas about trans issues. She has definitely done some good, like going after Onision, but in general she‚Äôs not great."
8440,2020-06-28 07:46:31,hh8xbg,"I agree but his point was to shock with his vile ‚Äòhumour‚Äô and not actually make a fair point about domestic violence. If it were, he could have phrased it in a million different ways"
8441,2020-06-28 07:45:52,hh8xbg,"Oh, gotcha."
8442,2020-06-29 00:41:24,hh8xbg,"Right! I've been watching the megathreads and watching videos on YT and stuff and just when I think I'm all caught up something else comes out! 

Almost reminds me of when I'd miss a class and then have so much catching up to do, trying to understand what I missed. üòÖ"

8444,2020-06-28 11:49:49,hh8xbg,Wow thanks for sharing! I hadn‚Äôt thought about it that way. I definitely agree - donating the revenue to victims and organizations that uplift the people he has hurt. And I absolutely agree that he should spend at least a year reflecting and working to become a better person!

8451,2020-06-29 00:37:53,hh8xbg,"Haven‚Äôt listened to the podcast and generally don‚Äôt vibe with either of them, but if it counts for anything my little brother is trans and he believes that having body dysmorphia is a mental illness and feels he is mentally ill due to that, but that being he still wishes to have his feelings and pronouns seen as acceptable and validated regardless-as we should."
8452,2020-06-29 00:33:47,hh8xbg,"I mean, lots of trans people agree with that assessment. Body dysmorphia is the ""illness"", and for many trans people (not all), medically transitioning lessens that dysphoria, making it the treatment.

EDIT: gender dysphoria, not body dysmorphia! my bad"
8453,2020-06-29 01:01:54,hh8xbg,"As a trans person, I don‚Äôt think calling it a mental illness is THAT far off... gender dysphoria/GID is so crippling and affects your daily life negatively."

8466,2020-06-30 01:58:46,hh8xbg,Totally

8469,2020-06-28 18:59:56,hh8xbg,I feel she had to mention him to have some credibility: Shane is kinda done (imho) and she wouldn‚Äôt be a reliable narrator in her watchers‚Äô eyes if she doesn‚Äôt distance herself a little (at least) from him
8470,2020-06-28 17:28:54,hh8xbg,Holding r*pe and m*lestation allegations for tea is shitty behavior and he spread other people‚Äôs story around for giggles. Nah.
8471,2020-06-28 17:27:46,hh8xbg,"I mean the implication that Jeffree has all this blackmail material is not particularly good for
Him"
8472,2020-06-28 17:30:07,hh8xbg,"Holding potential rape allegations over someone‚Äôs head as ‚Äútea‚Äù is extremely damaging. this goes beyond YouTube drama. These are people‚Äôs lives. If there‚Äôs even a possibility, which is really compelling because he‚Äôs mentioned it on the podcast, then that‚Äôs very concerning..... I don‚Äôt understand your point here. Were you hoping for her to out the person who was raped? Would that be good enough?..."
8473,2020-06-28 17:31:13,hh8xbg,"A bunch of people including Joff himself claimed receipts last year. Don't get me wrong. If i see receipts I am done with James. But until then, wtf"
8474,2020-06-29 09:39:34,hh8xbg,I‚Äôm also struggling with that. I mean... I know everyone has probably laughed at or participated in jokes about sensitive topics. ........ But I don‚Äôt personally know anyone who has ever made a joke about sexualizing kids. It‚Äôs not something I would ever joke about or laugh at. That‚Äôs revolting.
8475,2020-06-29 11:11:09,hh8xbg,"I've posted about this already, so I don't want anybody to think I'm excusing any of the things Shane's done bc I'm absolutely not, but: this as a topic is going to be more present, more often, in the thoughts of someone it's happened to than it is going to be for people who it hasn't. That's just something that trauma can do to you.

Again, not trying to excuse anything he's done or said, but it's context that imo partially answers this question, which seems to be a question that's vexing a lot of people"
8476,2020-06-28 07:20:36,hh8xbg,5 years ago he was still a grown ass adult.
8477,2020-06-28 07:08:02,hh8xbg,5 years ago isn‚Äôt really that long in Shane‚Äôs career. Especially when people claim the racism ended over a decade ago.
8478,2020-06-28 07:11:09,hh8xbg,5 years is recent relatively speaking in regards to everything else circulating.
8479,2020-06-28 07:19:39,hh8xbg,"Joff is better off saying nothing. He can‚Äôt defend Shane or drag Shane without bringing attention to his own past. If doing either could benefit him, he would have already"

8491,2020-06-29 16:02:13,hh8xbg,"She‚Äôs always been pretty anti Jeffree and has spoken out against him. 

She can be pretty cruel though. She definitely likes to hint that she knows all this insider information, but won‚Äôt share it, and then rubs it in everyone‚Äôs face when things come out the way she mildly and vaguely hinted previously. 

She also once body shamed Jeffree and was mocking him for looking ‚Äúanorexic.‚Äù That wasn‚Äôt okay at all."

8494,2020-06-29 21:04:10,hh8xbg,"This is a very good point.  A lot of people buy his makeup and have no idea.  A couple of girls I go to school with bought Conspiracy palettes when it launched and recommended me to watch the YT series.  I watched it and fell for it all myself.  Even as someone that watches YT content, for the most part I had no iidea what their pasts were.  And even if people do hear something, the average person may not dig very deep bc much of this information is on YT Drama channels, he said/she said, deleted Twitter threads, screenshots of DMs, and so on.  It‚Äôs a can of worms that gets thrown away once opened instead of followed bc it can be confusing to follow along and to figure out all the drama and characters along the way."
8495,2020-06-29 23:18:05,hh8xbg,Can confirm this was me. I have sooooo much of his stuff just from buying frequently on BeautyBay and beautylish. I didn‚Äôt really watch drama channels at all and the most I knew about him was he was ‚Äòa bit controversial.‚Äô Now I know the full extent and feel sick

8500,2020-06-28 21:05:50,hh8xbg,"Right?? Im so confused, its like people WANT this to detract from Shane so they can have more to gossip and get upset about.

8520,2020-06-28 15:43:56,hh8xbg,This is accurate. Until the series I had never watched Shane Dawson. I actually liked him in the series! I thought it was annoying how he always complained about how ‚Äúpoor‚Äù he was but I thought he had funny moments and a decent personality. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a lot more like me!
8521,2020-06-28 15:42:03,hh8xbg,"I didn't. I found J* first because someone else I watch brought him up. Not long after I found Shane because of their videos together. So, I've only known about any of them for like 2 years."
8522,2020-06-28 18:56:53,hh8xbg,i agree. it‚Äôs gross how easy it is for him to twist the narrative and get what he wants at the cost of others

Due diligence is required in 2020."
8543,2020-06-28 20:01:58,hh8xbg,But also what is the trans joke from Friends? Asking bc I know the show inside and out and clearly missed it.
8544,2020-06-28 14:32:54,hh8xbg,"Exactly. As kids, we didn‚Äôt know better. As adults? We do."
8545,2020-06-28 15:12:59,hh8xbg,"definitely. also you have to consider his international audience of kids as well. like how are their parents supposed to know if his content is child friendly or not if they can't speak english very well? i get that the majority of his audience is american but even so. i know my mom probably wouldn't have understood the meaning of a lot of his problematic videos (except the blackface of course) even though her english is pretty decent. 

and it's also impossible for parents to monitor everything their children do, especially when they're not at home. this isn't super relevant but about 10 years ago my friends and i used to call this thing called ''heta linjen'' (every swede will know what it is lol) where we would get in contact with old (pedo) men during recess when i was like 10-11. no teacher or parent or any adult found out until one of them sent a d\*ck pic to one of my friends whom sent it to me, which was only discovered when my phone broke and mom took it to a repair shop and they told her about it. my point is that kids are really good at hiding stuff and it's unfair to put all the blame on parents/adults. (that's not to say parents aren't ever to blame of course, things like this can often be prevented if parents keep a close eye on their kids.)"

Just like Shane, she said her two cents and now wants nothing to do with this but yet supposedly knows allllll whats happening behind the scenes. And now all of a suddenly is taking a backseat and is dipping out to Shane when she saw how serious and dark things got with him."

8569,2020-06-30 02:17:17,hh8xbg,"They‚Äôre doing great, although it‚Äôs becoming hard to stomach tbh.

It does bring up the question of how much accountability do we actually want him to take? Because this is becoming extremely serious. There was a video on the subreddit of Shane interviewing a 13 year old girl on the street and he proceeded to look down her top. In the middle of a busy street he sexually assaulted a minor. If your average Joe did that, what would we would like to happen to him? I‚Äôd want him to never be allowed around kids again."

I can imagine that Garrett may have not like that and didn‚Äôt want to hang around J anymore, so when Shane started spending so much time with J Garrett might have decided to distance himself.

8614,2020-06-28 19:30:01,hh8xbg,"Tdlr of blaire‚Äôs video:

She starts of by saying that she was scared to release the video, but decided to go ahead as it was ‚Äúthe right thing to do‚Äù Claims to have been told things by J that made her feel complicit to his actions

Verifies that she has never met J, but facetimed him twice

She explains that when she was making a video on Dahvie Vanity, J called her and manipulated her into not releasing the vid. She agreed to not release it.

When she saw J on the Chris Hansen podcast ‚Äúclearing‚Äù his name, she realized he lied and dropped the video

On the facetime when J was manipulative, she claims that J told her that James Charles raped a well known youtuber and he provided a voice memo proving it. Blaire feels that it is not her place to release the memo, but urges the victim to speak up.

She claims J told her that another well known youtuber raped someone, but while J provided no evidence, she believes it is ‚Äúbelievable‚Äù

She finishes by saying she doesn‚Äôt condone shanes jokes, amd that she just discovered everything like the rest of us.

To conclude, she provided no receipts, but i think not releasing the voice memo is understandable if its true

She says that keemstar probs has heard the voice memo as J is alleged to have played it to him before an interview

Edit: words"

8619,2020-06-28 19:07:58,hh8xbg,"Exactly!!! It‚Äôs no one else‚Äôs information to share. J* put others in that disgusting position by spreading the memo, and *he* needs to answer for it"
8620,2020-06-28 19:04:32,hh8xbg,"Then it shouldn't have been brought up. Because the choices are either, 1. Force the alleged victim to come out and confirm or 2. Ruin JC again by having unconfirmed allegations float around.

Sexual assault allegations should not be used as an UNO out card.

What is the point of bringing up the voice memos if you are not going to provide evidence or if you are only mentioning them when you want to further defame somebody??"
8621,2020-06-28 19:00:16,hh8xbg,Totally agree. Dropping the voice memo publicly OR sharing the voice memo privately to others without the victim's consent is absolutely unacceptable. J* has already done the latter multiple times.
8622,2020-06-28 19:00:18,hh8xbg,"So is hanging a life and career ruining accusation over someone‚Äôs head for at this point, years. This is from my opinion as a molestation survivor so take it however you want. I feel like I have the authority to have an opinion on this."

8627,2020-06-28 07:57:12,hh8xbg,Yeah I think he will. He won‚Äôt ever be able to make a movie or be in Hollywood. But I think he‚Äôll definitely still be able to post videos and have a large audience.
8628,2020-06-28 15:03:29,hh8xbg,"I mean I don‚Äôt have any expectations either. She announced it multiple times on her instagram though, would be foolish of her to lie to her viewers."
8629,2020-06-28 15:00:55,hh8xbg,Yeah I‚Äôm taking her word with a grain of salt at this point.
8630,2020-06-28 15:23:26,hh8xbg,Right! Thats what she said before the podcasts and videos were leaked of S being a pdo. Maybe her whole narrative has changed by now (she did state in her IG story that she changed a segment of the video). I guess we‚Äôll seeü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
8631,2020-06-29 13:00:41,hh8xbg,"Sanders also said something along the lines of ""he showed everyone but me apparently"" Rich lux and Nick Snyder are the drama channels closest to him so if he showed the message to any of them, it was probably them."
8632,2020-06-29 15:02:12,hh8xbg,"I can't be bothered to find the exact video since there are so many now, but I know ashley kyle said she's certain that jeffree told what he told her to blair and tati. 

Whether that was being told the contents or shown the contents I wouldn't know."
8633,2020-06-29 14:21:16,hh8xbg,"100%. She's dramatic and quite emotional at times, but she's not stupid enough to break her drama free streak for vitamins. I think it was the straw that broke the camel's back that let her even consider he could do such terrible things. She looked into it and had bad people hand feed her lies and circumstancial evidence. 

She's still responsable for her actions, and admitting there is likely more to the story than what we can prove is  not denying that."
8634,2020-06-29 14:56:15,hh8xbg,"I don't think Tati is a bad person, far from that, I think her emotions, sensitivity and empathy led her to a bad judgement call. I think if you seperated the world into 50% good 50% bad, she'd be in the good for sure.  
She shoulda sorted it out in private, but it was a human error, and I believe her 100% when she said, and JC agrees that she had no ill intent but to cut off a toxic relationship.

But the thing is, most people don't see JS's manipulation, you can't really prove it. So she gets the blame, because ""Tati's the one that made a 50min video"". It's  sad seeing her get hate for accusing JC of being a predator, which she actually didn't do."
8635,2020-06-29 15:08:13,hh8xbg,"I'd be mortified, victim's of SA or abuse have a hard time dealing with what happened ( I know firsthand) let alone the fear of what happens when they come forward, if the person who assaulted you was an insanely famous person, who was filthy rich.. I know I'd be scared to go to the police and think of court and how public everything would be.. 

A victim loses their feeling of power and control, and gain fear,which is why it's so hard for them to come forward. Imagine someone else taking the *only* power you had left, which was coming forward, and used it for their own gain. They end up powerless again. That was THEIR story to tell, not Jeffrees or TatisThat's what makes Jeffree AND Tati  monsters."
8636,2020-06-29 17:11:59,hh8xbg,"I agree. She didn't care about the victim, she cared about her biggest influencer friend promoting another brand."
8637,2020-06-28 10:44:32,hh8xbg,"I‚Äôm exactly his age and completely agreed! Racism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, bigotry all flew but PEDOPHILIA?! That was, is, and NEVER WILL BE funny. It‚Äôs creepy and sick. It‚Äôs truly disturbing to me...."
8638,2020-06-28 11:24:32,hh8xbg,"yeah, ""it's just how things were"" actually means ""none of the people calling me out were white so it was easier for me to ignore them"""
8639,2020-06-28 12:05:58,hh8xbg,"Yeah onion boy is another level of fucked up, I meant it in a broken clock is right twice a day kind of way when he accused him of being weird around kids."
8640,2020-06-28 12:08:07,hh8xbg,"I agree, would be better if he went to jail, but can't win em all."
8641,2020-06-28 12:02:25,hh8xbg,"It was in 2017 I think, they used to be friends and Shane ghosted Onision which he got pissed about, then made a bunch of videos accusing Shane of being a pedo/being weird around kids. Then he made an ""apology"" video where he basically just said he doesn't know for sure. The details are blurry to me too because it was so long ago and I never watched Onision or Shane, but lots of people made videos on it back in the day."
8642,2020-06-28 13:15:44,hh8xbg,"super quick summary off the top of my head: they're both OG YTers and crossed paths back in the day; the Onion refers to Shame as his ""first gay kiss""; then something something, Shame decided to walk away from the """"friendship"""" and publicly announce it, so the Onion came out guns blazing accusing him of all kinds of stuff-mainly the P word-which we're seeing some evidence of today."
8643,2020-06-28 17:46:01,hh8xbg,I don‚Äôt think she has anything to worry about. If this is true Jeffree Star wanted this out and she just did his dirty work
8644,2020-06-28 17:34:03,hh8xbg,"This is so dramatic. She didn't even mention any new info on him. We all knew J* has dirt on people and had an alleged voice memo, he talked about it himself. she just put it into different words"

8652,2020-06-28 19:30:11,hh8xbg,"This voice memo is around since last year. We all knew about it and it's still not a proof of James being a predator. I don't want to sound like I'm defending James, I'm not a fan of his, but we did this same routine last year and it got messed up real quickly. We need to be more careful now."
8653,2020-06-28 19:27:41,hh8xbg,Exactly. This tactic is very clear to me.
8654,2020-06-28 19:27:16,hh8xbg,I know. And she is also transphobic. There a post here with a video full of receipts but I'm not being able to find rn. Sorry.

I hope David is next to apologize since he likes to try and sweep thing under the rug"
8663,2020-06-30 01:28:19,hh8xbg,"Mocked an Asian accent while opening Japanese snacks with David i think,"
8664,2020-06-30 01:37:46,hh8xbg,didn't she also say she had racist stereotyped characters?
8665,2020-06-28 18:53:13,hh8xbg,"It just confirms the existence of some type of receipt ,ugh even using that term in relation to sexual assault allegations makes me sick, which we already knew existed from the podcast and limits the potential victim to being a youtube which is disgusting if true as it leads to unwanted speculation"
8666,2020-06-28 19:36:53,hh8xbg,"Ditto. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice...shame on me, because at that point, I'm willingly letting people make me look like a clown."
8667,2020-06-29 19:02:46,hh8xbg,"Blaire positions herself as a champion of victims of sexual violence but she has her own agenda and always has. She uses those stories to push narratives that have roots in her political position. James is catnip for her because he's the ""wrong kind of queer"" so getting that narrative out trumps all other concerns."
8668,2020-06-29 17:05:27,hh8xbg,I mean what was she supposed to do in all fairness? If jeffree star was using my voice recording talking about my assault to blackmail people then I would want to know about it. She can't just take what jeffree says at face value
8669,2020-06-28 22:30:34,hh8xbg,That‚Äôs why if this memo existed I would be so utterly disgusted - more than I already am - by the fact that Jointworm Sponge is strategically using this person‚Äôs trauma to keep his ass safe ü§°
8670,2020-06-29 00:19:23,hh8xbg,"It's just so frustrating. She really had zero new information to share (and thank fuck for it - I'm not saying she should have outed someone or given details of the contents of the memo) and really just sat there rambling about how J* is ""bad"" and she's ""terrified"", etc. 

And I'm just like... girl, you had nothing useful to add to the conversation to begin with, you really could have just been quiet if you're that scared lol."
8671,2020-06-28 09:43:42,hh8xbg,"All this information is very interesting but  I'm referring to his main channel ""Shane"" and not ""ShaneDawsonTV""."
8672,2020-06-28 08:23:49,hh8xbg,I'm not talking about that one. His main channel has lost 500.000 subscribers and 1 billion views. Never have I seen such a thing before. It's right there on [Socialblade](https://socialblade.com/youtube/user/shane)

8677,2020-06-29 07:58:03,hh8xbg,^^^^ tati and shane never accused jc of being a predator. j* was the one who put that out into the universe (in a tweet responding to james‚Äô younger brother of all things!!!)

8708,2020-06-28 20:53:42,hh8xbg,I really don‚Äôt think Jeff cares what happens to Shane. He wants him to be a scapegoat :/

8715,2020-06-28 20:10:01,hh8xbg,Good question actually.. IS THERE a cease and desist against Jeffree Star from James?? I'd say thats probably a huuuuge reason why he's been radio silent.
8716,2020-06-28 20:03:51,hh8xbg,"It helps J\* because it gets a bunch of alt-right men who watch BW's content to help defend him, and now the conversation is shifted to discussing her video/rehashing JC's drama from last year instead of where this originally started, which was J\* paying off drama channels (in addition to his racist bullshit)."
8717,2020-06-28 10:00:05,hh8xbg,"This is why he has to be de-platformed now. We can't allow people to be a menace to the community and then turn around as if nothing happened. Growth and second chances are great but I feel he's outdone all of that. He's had his chances and he's apologized over and over but he hasn't grown as a person. He's still that edge lord, and he made comments after all these apologies. It's unforgivable. Also, I am unsure If the Travon Martin comments have made rounds here but that was horrible. He shouldn't be allowed to continue to make and reak the benefits off of this channel anymore. If artists and movie stars can be blackballed for their problematic behavior, he can be de-platformed"

8736,2020-06-28 23:42:49,hh8xbg,"Did you watch this video? Her intention was clearly to bring up the James drama. The Jeffree thumbnail and clickbait title were so that she could drum up attention for herself. 
She hardly said anything about Jeffree in that entire video. She brought up stale drama about Jeffree having this voice memo and showing it to people. Jeffree was on a podcast a week or so a go offering to let someone hear the alleged tape. She exposed nothing."
8737,2020-06-28 23:41:23,hh8xbg,I did. I still believe it was orchestrated by Jeff. Even if she was (maybe) not aware of his intention I believe he manipulated her into reiterating his ‚ÄòJames is a p*do‚Äô narrative from last year. She just didn‚Äôt do a great job of it.

Which now makes no sense when she does the exact same thing to ppl accuse them without any proof. Especially the video exposing JC alleged victims.
8758,2020-06-28 21:04:45,hh8xbg,That jeffufuh is behind it all
8759,2020-06-28 18:55:14,hh8xbg,"I was thinking that, has Ashley come out and confirmed it was the same thing as he told her yet?"
8760,2020-06-29 02:01:22,hh8xbg,Exactly. The accused is always assumed innocent until proven guilty in the United States.
8761,2020-06-29 14:19:03,hh8xbg,"I know this is getting down to brass tacks and I don't know much about the legalities... but technically if J* had a recording of someone lying and saying he was molested by James... is he defaming him by saying he has the voice memo?

8764,2020-06-28 15:56:27,hh8xbg,Yep this is exactly what I think. I don‚Äôt think Tati will release anything and I also agree about why she‚Äôs posting those song lyrics.
8765,2020-06-28 16:06:18,hh8xbg,"She posted Bullet with Butterfly Wings. That is a legit pissed off song. If I had to guess if it was about her life and not BG drama, it seems more appropriate for separation/divorce or breaking off another major relationship in her life."
8766,2020-06-30 00:12:22,hh8xbg,"When Liam claimed on twitter Tati deleted her collab with Shane, he said he got that tea from Angelika Oles. 

That collab was never posted. So it's kinda irresponsible to put that out there. And it makes it look like she never checks it herself and just makes videos based on what others tell her."
8767,2020-06-29 23:55:27,hh8xbg,She REALLY needs to make notes. She got into uni; she‚Äôs smart enough to do simple research and take basic notes.
8768,2020-06-29 23:57:50,hh8xbg,That she tends to shirk the details and kinda give a very much too broad description of what‚Äôs going on without backing anything up.
8769,2020-06-29 23:56:53,hh8xbg,In fairness Smokey Glow in her latest video also says that she's been hearing about this memo from influencers as well.

8772,2020-06-28 22:29:01,hh8xbg,"She had like a 75 minute stream of her claiming that YouTube is literally working against her. It boiled down to her music videos not getting as many views (not a great singer but no it's definitely YouTube gods). Trisha actually responded saying that people fall out of favor and everyone goes up and down. 
You know it's a scary day when Trisha is the reasonable one."
8773,2020-06-28 22:22:25,hh8xbg,Wheeeeew I got exhausted reading the people she is fighting with lol!!
8774,2020-06-28 22:23:39,hh8xbg,Lol yeah...I just thought maybe it was related to what she allegedly said to Peter Monn about J*
8775,2020-06-29 03:43:57,hh8xbg,And yet he interviewed her with a straight face and pretending to give a shit when she came out of treatment. What fakeass gutter trash

8779,2020-06-29 14:03:19,hh8xbg,True but Littlefinger was strategic and calm. J* seems to act based on rage and emotion. I would say he's a mix of both.
8780,2020-06-29 14:53:46,hh8xbg,"Ooh, this one is spot on."
8781,2020-06-29 15:47:44,hh8xbg,It's such a weird thing to lie about when there have been pictures and videos of him drinking. Replace the wine with a red bull I guess.
8782,2020-06-29 21:17:08,hh8xbg,"It‚Äôs possible that it would have, sure, but SD‚Äôs parody was honestly incredibly disturbing & came on the heels of very public issues with stalkers for TSwizz."

8787,2020-06-28 13:17:01,hh8xbg,"Not to excuse anyone of responsibility for their part, but I don't think it's fair to say people didn't stop her. Like you said, she's a grown woman, it goes both ways. No one can force her to post something, but no one can stop her either. I've had plenty of friends make decisions I disagree with. Do I try to talk them out of it? Ofc. But ultimately they're adults. All I can do is call them out after the fact."

8790,2020-06-28 17:25:56,hh8xbg,"Meh, I don‚Äôt believe it. Jebbediah during Mom‚Äôs Basement podcast said himself that he couldn‚Äôt be certain of the veracity of the voice memo."

8809,2020-06-29 04:09:23,hh8xbg,Oh 100% he deserves to get what he‚Äôs getting. It‚Äôs just a loooot at once. I‚Äôm sure he understands how JC felt now. James said the feeling of universal hatred pushed him to the edge so I just worry about that. I definitely don‚Äôt think this response is undeserved.
8810,2020-06-29 04:10:13,hh8xbg,This analogy is splendid
8811,2020-06-29 04:10:56,hh8xbg,Lol true. I should keep that in mind.

8814,2020-06-29 04:06:37,hh8xbg,"I'm worried they may abandon him or not be great for him. His mom acts like this sweet, innocent lady but there's a video going around where he's talking to a very young fan on omegle and he asks her to twerk for him (she does) and flash him *with his mom right there* while she just laughs along. What mother sees any of the content he used to make and actively supports it? Then there's Ryland and Morgan. I'd like to think Ryland is supporting him and encouraging him to seek help but I'm sure this all has to be hard on him as well. Morgan already unfollowed J* so she seems to have some issue with whats happening. If Shane loses his platform and they stand by him I'm sure they would too? Like how could Ryland move forward with his channel with Shane completely canceled?

Edit: I will just say that while I say I'm worried for him, it doesn't mean I'm defending him. I fully believe he deserves to lose his entire career along with anyone who decides to still associate with him after this. I just don't wish on anyone that they lose their family along with that."
8815,2020-06-29 04:06:00,hh8xbg,Agreed. At least Ryland is around. And probably his mom.

8822,2020-06-28 22:46:10,hh8xbg,"Why do we think he's reputable? He clearly had no issue with Jeffree as the face of his business, why would he have an issue with Shane?"
8823,2020-06-28 22:54:02,hh8xbg,OMG I thought it was Jeff Cohen as in Chunk from the Goonies (who's also currently an attorney). The partner is a different Cohen attorney.  Almost had a heart attack.

8826,2020-06-29 15:46:30,hh8xbg,"No. There won‚Äôt be another video from her again imo. Idk why ppl keep assuming she will put out one. She‚Äôs learnt her lesson and burnt herself the first time round she ain‚Äôt stupid enough to do it again knowing it could damage her now that she has a make up line on top of the vitamins. And the same goes to JC, we can expect no videos from them addressing this drama anymore unless they‚Äôre fucking stupid they all got out barely alive. Quote me."
8827,2020-06-29 16:25:03,hh8xbg,Same girl I got my big old shoes and my squeaky noes on ü§°ü§°ü§°
8828,2020-06-28 18:47:32,hh8xbg,"Jeffree himself said it's not a real testimony and it's not ""proof"" of anything."
8829,2020-06-28 21:44:30,hh8xbg,"exactly! what all of them have done is backed the alleged victim into a corner which is an awful, awful place to be. i understand blaire‚Äôs perspective of not wanting anyone else to get hurt bc that is something i struggled with as well, but at the end of the day she needs to step back and take a long hard look at the situation. she really has no reason to believe that JC is currently putting anyone else in danger. and then on top of that she mentions JC‚Äôs allegations but wont name the supposed other youtuber? so i have to again question how sincere she was in her desire to do the right thing.

so basically in the span of one comment, ive come to a more firm conclusion on blaire lol. i dont think she‚Äôs being manipulated necessarily but she is 100% in over her head. 

and thank you!"
8830,2020-06-28 21:44:50,hh8xbg,thanks! hope you do the same
8831,2020-06-29 02:05:09,hh8xbg,"It's corporate America, they would absolutely do something like this if it meant they could make money."
8832,2020-06-29 02:12:01,hh8xbg,No Shane video has ever been produced by the YouTube. Instant Influencer was labeled a YouTube Original.
8833,2020-06-29 03:12:16,hh8xbg,That to me is what is infuriating. Shane's racist content was monetized...correct? They are supporting and paying racist content.
8834,2020-06-29 02:34:37,hh8xbg,I saw earlier on SocialBlade that his estimated monthly and yearly income from his channel is $0. Did they demonetize him?
8835,2020-06-29 03:02:33,hh8xbg,"That could definitely be used as some sort of defensive argument. I know that US Federal Law (18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2511) upholds one party consent.

8836,2020-06-29 23:32:20,hh8xbg,"Seriously, I'm disappointed that it took so long for him to FINALLY cover it"
8837,2020-06-30 04:02:09,hh8xbg,He seems like the only big YTer with a competent team around him.

8845,2020-06-28 23:02:12,hh8xbg,thank you for mentioning this to me! was being sarcastic about burning but i could see how that could be taken seriously lol
8846,2020-06-28 17:17:27,hh8xbg,"Yup I was thinking...even though everything going down right now is ugly, we have a piece of beauty/youtube history when they stop selling it or if J*'s brand closes. If someone really asks...you can say ""some indie brand, I forgot""."

8849,2020-06-28 17:20:33,hh8xbg,Well that's why Tati posted her video in the first place.
8850,2020-06-28 17:39:01,hh8xbg,But they also checked in on him during the scandal?
8851,2020-06-28 19:14:24,hh8xbg,"She knows she has to speak out on the Shane stuff and she will, but it hurts her bc she liked him a lot."
8852,2020-06-28 19:25:46,hh8xbg,"She feels like she owes the success of her channel to Shame, since he was one of the first mainstream YouTubers to collab with her. But on the other hand, since Blaire uses her channel to call out predators, she knows she‚Äôd be a huge hypocrite if she let this slide. And she‚Äôs devastated by losing Shame as a friend"
8853,2020-06-29 03:00:31,hh8xbg,"It was his aunt who said that, not the cousin."
8854,2020-06-29 01:56:24,hh8xbg,"He talked to his Aunt, not his cousin. I'd want nothing to do with him. A 12 y/o is old enough to know it was wrong."
8855,2020-06-29 16:16:59,hh8xbg,Why not call out the boyfriend instead? Or call them both out?
8856,2020-06-29 16:07:31,hh8xbg,Damon isn't trans...
8857,2020-06-29 16:02:12,hh8xbg,so he is exposing blair for associating with horrible people (her boyfriend) after two years... i don't mind it but shane deserves the same.
8858,2020-06-29 19:52:43,hh8xbg,"Given that she just survived her own drama, I would wonder if anyone else reached out to her.  Also, why is that kid that called her out now a full on drama channel?  That speaks volumes."
8859,2020-06-28 19:16:21,hh8xbg,"The ability to make money, play the victim, and make gender non-conforming queer folk look like freaks to her base audience must have been an unstoppable combo for Blaire."
8860,2020-06-28 19:18:05,hh8xbg,"I don't think orchestrating this is really that complicated. Use a clickbait title and a clickbait thumbnail, throw out some teasers making the video sound extreme and then not offer any new information and divert the conversation."
8861,2020-06-28 19:22:07,hh8xbg,"This whole ""I'm afraid of him"" looks more like a tactic to put off anyone who are thinking of coming forward with more evidence against him. The message is, do it and you will should be afraid. Like those alt-right twitter accounts who create fake accounts to swear at themselves, just to pretend they sued the fake account and they apologised and backed off.

Same concept."
8862,2020-06-28 19:25:07,hh8xbg,Completely agree!
8863,2020-06-28 20:26:54,hh8xbg,Being supportive of kids is abuse. I'd love to hear the logic behind that one.

8883,2020-06-28 07:13:38,hh8xbg,Yeah but if he keeps quiet long enough and everyone's too obsessed with cancelling Shane he might be able to avoid a real cancellation himself.

8889,2020-06-28 17:32:14,hh8xbg,"What? Because we don‚Äôt want to support racists or people who cape for the far right? ??

Edit: formatting"
8890,2020-06-28 18:43:38,hh8xbg,"I would assume because it wasn‚Äôt monetized and the more views he gets the more the video gets suggested and people can see through the bs. Blaire is after money, views, and hot takes"
8891,2020-06-29 12:02:32,hh8xbg,"I don't take issue with the fact she reached out. I take issue with the fact she deliberately pointed out to her audience that she encouraged the victim to tell their story publicly.

I understand Blaire's tell-all was her way to come to terms with her experiences, but Blaire has to know that this victim's situation is significantly more socially charged. Several vicious people have a stake in that victim's story being shared, and Blaire also has some stake with Shane being her friend and him wanting to serve James Charles a ""slice of humble pie""). If she framed her conversation with the victim as her mentioning all these options with a public tell-all as one of the many options, I would be less agitated by it. Her emphasizing the public tell-all option to her audience puts an immense amount of pressure on the victim, and honestly, it makes it seems like she's using it for social currency too, to a lesser or unconscious degree than J\* (in reference to her friendship with Shane and alleviating the drama from him and onto James Charles)."
8892,2020-06-29 14:55:39,hh8xbg,"If I remember correctly, Blaire implied in her Stories that she doesn't believe Shane deserved the hate he was getting, and called out J* for not ""clearing Shane's name"". She then said that if J* didn't come clean and defend Shane, she would. So I think the video she released now is the one she was speaking about in her stories, hence why it's assumed that it was created to defend Shane in some way."
8893,2020-06-29 14:53:16,hh8xbg,"IIRC, Blaire said that if J\* didn't speak up and defend Shane, she'd post a video exposing him and the ""dirt"" he had (heavily paraphrased). It's one of the reasons her ""I HAD to release more info about the victim, otherwise how could I love with myself"" narrative annoys me a bit. She seemed content to sit on that info until it was beneficial to her interests to reveal it."
8894,2020-06-28 16:47:38,hh8xbg,"His ""oOoOooooHhhhh"" at the end is the worst. what a smug arrogant dickhead"
8895,2020-06-28 22:52:02,hh8xbg,Disgusting. Absolutely disgusting.
8896,2020-06-28 16:49:38,hh8xbg,That's horrific. Absolutely horrific.
8897,2020-06-28 22:51:41,hh8xbg,THAT IS NASTY WHAT IN THE WORLD
8898,2020-06-29 00:22:20,hh8xbg,She even has midroll ads and links to merch stores on her other videos about predators. She clearly doesn‚Äôt care about anyone‚Äôs well-being
8899,2020-06-29 00:21:52,hh8xbg,Blaire is basically Mill Yiannopolis and Candace Owens but for trans people
8900,2020-06-28 21:55:37,hh8xbg,"Yeah it really didn‚Äôt reveal anything new. Geoffrey already has said he has receipts on everyone. He also already said he had this recording and offered to play it for Banks (so we already knew he was showing people). We already knew he tried to manipulate drama channels to cover him favorably. 

The big reveal was that he called her after she posted about him? That was the only NEW tea on him. All she has done now is fan flames back towards JC and the person on the tape. Because even if she didn‚Äôt say anyone‚Äôs name, she has definitely made everyone think it‚Äôs one particular person. And while I have my own theories of why I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that youtuber, if it is, she just basically outed him."
8901,2020-06-29 01:26:14,hh8xbg,"He‚Äôs such a good Youtuber! I love his analysis on such bizarre content, and his Lorax thinkpiece is one of my favorite videos I‚Äôve watched"

8915,2020-06-29 17:04:48,hh8xbg,Si!!
8916,2020-06-28 19:02:08,hh8xbg,It would be an interesting twist for this to have this shine back on jeffree star. Cause I do believe he orchestrated this now.
8917,2020-06-29 11:45:28,hh8xbg,I cannot fucking imagine how it would feel to get that message if the story's true. Like to have a total fucking stranger bring up your trauma out of nowhere in your DMs and then to realise how many people it must have gone through to get there. So fucked
8918,2020-06-29 11:43:07,hh8xbg,"None of this was new information. Jeffree has said it himself that he has dirt on everyone. And we're talking about the same exact recording he also talked about himself from last year. Blair acted like she was so scared and had this crazy information and it was all things Jeffree has said himself just rephrased.

Even the ""shocking"" news that Jeffree is spreading this tape around. He was on a podcast just a few weeks ago and asked if they wanted to hear it."
8919,2020-06-29 11:44:25,hh8xbg,"Personally, I wanted her to stay quiet and not treat sexual assault like tea. I'm hoping there's no victim, ofc, but if there is one, if she really cares about them, she'd understand someone else's trauma isn't for her to discuss, if there is a person for real, Jeffree and Blaire are despicable for throwing it around just because someone got cancelled. That's disgusting behavior. 

We knew there was a voice memo already, we just don't know what the voice memo says, blaire didn't share anything new, she could've, and should've, stayed quiet."
8920,2020-06-29 13:47:06,hh8xbg,">I‚Äôm confused because I feel like Blaire came at Jeffree hard.

Her action of going at Jeffree is based on the assumption that the voice recording is real. If it is real, JC would be a rapist. Do you not see how that is what they are in fact trying to do?"
8921,2020-06-28 11:31:27,hh8xbg,"Watching a video is not the same level as endorsement as marrying the fucking guy, get real."
8922,2020-06-28 11:13:29,hh8xbg,"I don't think it's the same at all. Not all viewers are massively invested and know backstories, 99% videos I watch on youtube I don't know anything outside that video I watch. When you live/are engaged to someone you definitely know them as a person."
8923,2020-06-28 17:32:48,hh8xbg,Then don‚Äôt put it in the video. It‚Äôs a claim and there is no proof. So it‚Äôs irrelevant until that person decides it‚Äôs okay to reveal. She shouldn‚Äôt have even mentioned it if that person doesn‚Äôt want it revealed.
8924,2020-06-28 17:26:08,hh8xbg,I‚Äôll probably get destroyed in her youtube comments but I fucking said it to her she‚Äôs being a real hypocrite with all this hearsay when she ain‚Äôt backing up her claims either.
8925,2020-06-28 17:27:42,hh8xbg,[deleted]
8926,2020-06-28 17:48:32,hh8xbg,Then she shouldn‚Äôt have mentioned it. She‚Äôs claiming something vile without the proof to back it up. And it‚Äôs shitty if the person didn‚Äôt want that info released and then she just says it happened anyway. Like she‚Äôs doing what everyone else did about JC. Claiming serious accusations without proof. If she really respected the victim than she would have never brought them up at all.
8927,2020-06-28 18:48:37,hh8xbg,"I've been reading all this thread' comments since her video is out, and it's crazy how the majority has been focusing on talking about her negatively, and not on J*, who might have used 2 persons' rapes for his own profit."
8928,2020-06-28 20:42:04,hh8xbg,Happy bday!
8929,2020-06-29 17:08:22,hh8xbg,It‚Äôs applied all night üòî ü§°
8930,2020-06-29 16:26:15,hh8xbg,"1. They never asked to be dragged into this 
2. They are younger than James but do not get the same ‚Äújust kids‚Äù treatment.
3. Their dad just died months before and are clearly still morning. 
4. There was already distance between the twins & James before the drama happened
5. I‚Äôm sure Jeffree got his manipulative hands on them ASAP to get back at James 
6. Pretty much everyone jumped ships with James during that time. Grayson had such a spotlight on him that I can‚Äôt blame them."
8931,2020-06-29 16:17:38,hh8xbg,There is speculation that they are wrapped up in this somehow because they used to film with JC a lot and one of them is mentioned in the texts J* sent to JC in the No More Lies video.

8935,2020-06-29 17:35:11,hh8xbg,They've had their podcast for awhile now (months) it comes out on Tuesdays though
8936,2020-06-29 16:28:15,hh8xbg,Turn the bell notifications on for this one. It‚Äôs probably ‚Äúwe switched clothes for the day‚Äù but ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

8938,2020-06-28 11:15:07,hh8xbg,"Or to victims of sexual abuse because you know ‚Äúit‚Äôs just like a foot fetish‚Äù. Forget about being canceled, Shane should be investigated by the authorities."

I think that‚Äôs why Ryland and Morgan aren‚Äôt saying anything."
8942,2020-06-29 02:15:57,hh8xbg,"Totally agree. Sorry, to clarify, if there is merit to the accusations, it should be reported and law enforcement should be involved, not just because YouTubers are talking about it.

Is it possible that some people aren‚Äôt able to speak on it because there is already legal involvement? Possibly. Who knows.

Like I said, it should be taken with a grain of salt. It‚Äôs a very convoluted situation, and difficult to make a concrete opinion on anything. Just trying to make people aware of her controversial history."
8943,2020-06-29 01:59:16,hh8xbg,Agreed. She is dangerous.
8944,2020-06-29 18:35:03,hh8xbg,i also believe this as she stated she is a survivor as well and wouldn‚Äôt joke about it. her believing the memo is credible does NOT mean the memo actually is. it just is her perception to whatever she heard but it could be fake unknowing to her

8946,2020-06-28 17:39:43,hh8xbg,Yeah I just don't think this was a particularly interesting point to make. It felt a bit like  she was trying to insert herself into the story more than necessary imo. I don't think it's particularly shocking that Jeffree tried to call and do some damage control when she publicly stated she was going to be making a video about him. Most people would.

8953,2020-06-28 21:51:30,hh8xbg,Not back then - he was profitting from this as recently as the day his 'apology' came out. He *just* removed this stuff
8954,2020-06-30 02:23:08,hh8xbg,Honestly yeah. I don't think james would be so chill about jafar's allegations if he knew it was all bullshit
8955,2020-06-30 02:31:31,hh8xbg,The thing that's still so sad about this (to me) is that even without personally hearing the voice memo if you hear that it exists and you hear who the victim is and a few of the details and you BELIEVE Jeffree then the damage is done. At that point he doesn't even need to play it to you because it worked.
8956,2020-06-30 02:45:46,hh8xbg,I thot Blaire never heard it. In her video she says Jracial Slurs never provided any prove and that there is another person who was raped by another big YouTuber.
8957,2020-06-30 02:55:43,hh8xbg,Keemstar and Faze Banks have too
8958,2020-06-30 02:25:43,hh8xbg,I feel joke star just told everyone that another person heard it
8959,2020-06-28 05:56:55,hh8xbg,Idk about y‚Äôall but Jeffree been cancelled
8960,2020-06-28 05:59:18,hh8xbg,Apparently cuz people are still talking about Jeffree that has consistently shown he‚Äôs a vile person
8961,2020-06-28 05:59:39,hh8xbg,That part!
8962,2020-06-28 10:02:53,hh8xbg,Yep!
8963,2020-06-29 09:56:09,hh8xbg,They save automatically on android :)
8964,2020-06-29 08:28:55,hh8xbg,mine glitches and says i saved it when i never did so i never even rely on those üò´
8965,2020-06-29 08:29:47,hh8xbg,"Oh right! I figured they saved automatically, I'm sure they do on Samsungs, but like I said, I've never used them."
8966,2020-06-29 11:51:17,hh8xbg,"If somebody sent me a voice memo, I'd tell them that I couldn't play it and to text me instead. That really does seem so awkward. Either make a phone call, or send a text, no memos please."
8967,2020-06-29 10:32:55,hh8xbg,I will write a novel to my friend before using a voice note üòî
8968,2020-06-29 10:37:42,hh8xbg,"Someone else said that you can see if your voice note is saved so everything that could be leaked must have been calculated in some form. I wonder why he does it, beyond all of the normal human reasoning, why would he let the fact he's a vile pos leak? Or does he just not care? Honestly, I'm trying to figure out someone who I don't think can figure himself out."
8969,2020-06-29 08:30:15,hh8xbg,"That makes sense, also his talons would make texting difficult."

8971,2020-06-29 11:25:18,hh8xbg,Good ! She deserves to be called out.
8972,2020-06-29 12:01:53,hh8xbg,Omg I totally agree!  Her way of speaking and mannerisms completely reminded me of J*.
8973,2020-06-28 18:51:56,hh8xbg,"Yup, that's what it seemed like from the summaries. Doubly gross since I believe she's an abuse survivor herself? I could be misremembering that detail though. 

Then again, what more can be expected of Blaire fucking White, she who will happily throw the wider trans community under the bus if it gives her a leg up with her conservative cronies?"
8974,2020-06-28 08:46:33,hh8xbg,I agree with this. It‚Äôs fucked up but hardly a legal case

8988,2020-06-29 15:55:17,hh8xbg,"their fanbase is mostly girls just like Jeffree, and when they collaborated Jeffree was bringing like 10 million views per episode so views+clout=$$$. Also, they broke their friendship with James so needed someone to collab with. Now they've moved on to Larray."

The only place I've seen people come close to that is on YT and there people are focused on J* being shitty and not saying anything about JC - and even at that, there are upvoted comments saying Blaire's being manipulated, etc etc."
8995,2020-06-29 00:40:07,hh8xbg,They were flooding the thread around the time blaire posted her video. But now the consensus has shifted. Though you'll occassionally see those if you keep the thread sorted by New
8996,2020-06-29 00:35:48,hh8xbg,"They‚Äôre all over Twitter. When Blaires video first came out this morning this thread seemed ready to condemn JC again, but the tides quickly turned in the other direction."

I agree, onion boy being right about this doesn‚Äôt negate the fact that he‚Äôs a piece of shit."
9012,2020-06-28 09:12:53,hh8xbg,i'm not too deep deep into drama about him and since i started watching shane when he was in the phase of experimenting with food i didn't know he acted around kids like that.
9013,2020-06-28 09:11:07,hh8xbg,i know what onision has done. i watched countless videos exposing him. all i'm saying is he was right about shane and his behavior around kids.
9014,2020-06-28 19:17:07,hh8xbg,Exactly! I feel like everyone missed that because she addressed J* first
9015,2020-06-28 18:58:53,hh8xbg,">I honestly don‚Äôt know wtf you‚Äôre on about.

Then maybe you should shut up and read what I wrote again. This video absolutely feels like a Hail Mary for Shane because she just came in and started turning the narrative towards JC. She only created this video because her bestie, Shane was getting dragged for being a racist pedophile. Otherwise, this video would NOT have been made.  And bullshit that she didn't know about it. Shane's past has been out there for YEARS and it gets brought up every time he releases a documentary or a palette. If you believe that, then I have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell to you.

Nothing she said was new."
9016,2020-06-29 15:52:50,hh8xbg,I‚Äôm fairly sure it‚Äôs shade. Good for him
9017,2020-06-29 15:55:50,hh8xbg,"I think so too. I thought the same, maybe, he was somehow defending him but... obviously Shane keeps word vomiting and making things worse for himself and then with the other Shade (from Tiktok) thats been speculated Garrett threw his way, I'm also going to go with the former lol."
9018,2020-06-28 05:50:21,hh8xbg,In other words she better spill some good shit and not defend Shane. She is trash too.
9019,2020-06-28 17:36:54,hh8xbg,"Both things can be true. I tend to believe victims, SA is sometimes very difficult to prove and perpetrators very often go unpunished because of it. Obviously I won't form a super firm opinion without any proof but too many things fit together."
9020,2020-06-28 18:55:16,hh8xbg,"I don't watch Blair, J*, nor JC. Is there any reason to doubt her when she says it's about JC? Being a rape survivor herself, I don't get why she would spread false accusations like that."

9023,2020-06-28 17:37:51,hh8xbg,"I believe her too, too many things point at the same direction."
9024,2020-06-28 17:35:20,hh8xbg,Yea that's true. Like if someone comforts you saying someone has a voice memo of you saying something that never happened logically you would tell them it's not true. So idk
9025,2020-06-28 17:31:33,hh8xbg,She told me personally via DM that she spoke with the victim so...
9026,2020-06-28 17:32:43,hh8xbg,this is the perfect chance for tati to finally speak up if that is or isn‚Äôt true. it started with her and needs to end with her
9027,2020-06-28 17:33:57,hh8xbg,"Thats kind of where I'm at. Like I do think she heard a memo but I don't know if that memo should be enough to say its true. It could be lacking context, it could be fake. Idk. 

I just don't think blaires lying but I also doubt James is some rampant molester."
9028,2020-06-28 19:14:07,hh8xbg,All these allegations and no receipts????
9029,2020-06-28 19:41:08,hh8xbg,"Thank you!  I just watched her video and concluded she didn't have much to say.  She can't confirm any of the allegations.  She reignited the JC stuff which is exactly what J* would want. She didnt take down J as she had been insinuating she would but rather played right into his little hands.

Edit: spelling is hard"

9032,2020-06-28 19:24:25,hh8xbg,it's not monetized according to her ig. Those words are triggering for victims of SA so I'd assume that's why she bleeped them out.
9033,2020-06-28 18:54:37,hh8xbg,Yeah that‚Äôs why I though it was monetized too. I was just parroting her IG story. Maybe she was going to monetize it but decided against it.
9034,2020-06-28 19:50:20,hh8xbg,You‚Äôre right
9035,2020-06-28 19:41:33,hh8xbg,Agree. And I also agree that these people need to take action instead of just talking if there IS indeed proof.
9036,2020-06-28 19:48:54,hh8xbg,"Lol not J*, just another ü§° in this group lol"
9037,2020-06-28 21:14:40,hh8xbg,"Like if you're not gonna hold her accountable to shit she recently did, why hold Shane or Jeffree accountable for things they did way back?"
9038,2020-06-28 14:40:34,hh8xbg,Possibly the size of a certain NYC landmark?

9060,2020-06-28 21:05:00,hh8xbg,So basically she gave us nothing.
9061,2020-06-28 21:05:42,hh8xbg,"She also disavowed Shane for his pedophilic ""jokes""."
9062,2020-06-28 21:01:16,hh8xbg,Too Long Didn't Watch
9063,2020-06-28 21:00:51,hh8xbg,"I mean, probably, but also too long, didn‚Äôt watch. Basically a summary of the video."
9064,2020-06-28 21:00:52,hh8xbg,Stands for Too Long Didn't Watch
9065,2020-06-28 21:01:10,hh8xbg,"Too long, didn't watch is the abbreviation."
9066,2020-06-28 21:51:23,hh8xbg,"7 minutes in...i believe the ""scared of j*"" thing. She felt the receipt was good enough to personally reach out to the person. Which is something I'd never do.. or do you and tell them J* told you??

Shes talking very..personal in a believable at 7 min manner...she says j* told her a credible story about an entirely seperate situation of ""youtuber sa"" with no receipts. So..so far the evidence was credible enough for Blaire to feel personal about it..so. just taking it at her word..shes seen enough to basically make a decently unfilteres video over something thats been bothering her since forever.


Could blaire benefit from 'exposing'? Yes. Is that blaires reasoning? I honestly dont think so. She may have thought ""maybe some folks will see my side"" but i think its more ""i hope folks see i was trying"". 8 minutes in ""what do i do?""

Then she connects her memo story with j* podcast on keemstar.

She brings up a literal recent action j* messaged a clothing apparel company. Its about police lives meme vs BLM posters. J* messaged them saying they hope they get a rubber bullet in their face.

Kind of sad a rich MFer wouldnt use his influence to make change and instead intimidate smaller(?idk?) Brands on social media for ""differing political views""

I dont think blaire made this with J* behind the scenes. She literally sounds like she was...and i can vibe with this...under his control. At 11..you can hear it and i dont think shes faking a ""im free""...i think shes dealing with the reality that this person that we wanted to be good or at worst a chaotic neutral...is actually super awful.

Also anytime she mentions Jeffree on her wocial media Jeffree will within 5 ish minutes be contacting her personally. Yep. I believe that. Paying people to monitor a certain 100+ upcoming social celebs. 

She address the shane thing at 13-15. For someone who has benefitted so much from someone...its fair to that and its fair to reality. Her schtick is exposing predator stuff."
9067,2020-06-28 21:00:26,hh8xbg,"too long, didn't watch"
9068,2020-06-28 21:06:37,hh8xbg,"I‚Äôve been looking and couldn‚Äôt find any, hence why I asked for a link."
9069,2020-06-28 16:06:27,hh8xbg,"It keeps getting worse...

I didn‚Äôt even know he also asked the same 12 year old cousin to give another kid a l** d****...

What the fuck ? He thought sexualizing children funny?"
9070,2020-06-28 06:55:23,hh8xbg,gallop is the unproblematic king of youtube
9071,2020-06-28 06:55:06,hh8xbg,Yeah I sadly forgot.
9072,2020-06-28 06:54:53,hh8xbg,"In Morgans case he flew her out to LA where she hasn‚Äôt been happy, has lost alot of friends and has dealt with alot of bullshit

For Garrett he bailed on the company they founded together and in General acted pretty shitty to him during the spooky boys days 

And he basically abandoned drew, and also acted pretty shitty to him"
9073,2020-06-28 12:37:27,hh8xbg,"Yeah, Molly is pretty popular"
9074,2020-06-28 08:00:20,hh8xbg,"Primink has done a very good video about Boby Burns and Shane Dawson, that explains it pretty accurate. :)"
9075,2020-06-28 07:27:54,hh8xbg,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8zxMT-xTjs

TLDW: Shane fucked over Bobby's youtube career"
9076,2020-06-28 07:56:28,hh8xbg,"Shane did a whole series with him, put him on his channel, and then I think dropped him just as fast? You can head over to /r/shanedawson to learn more. Now he‚Äôs doing OnlyFans. Shane also bought him a car. I remember cuz Ryland was so obviously supremely jealous lol"
9077,2020-06-28 09:46:11,hh8xbg,Blaire White
9078,2020-06-28 19:30:44,hh8xbg,Honestly most teens are just that. He doesn't strike me as evil at all
9079,2020-06-28 19:42:18,hh8xbg,"I agree with this! All that has happened with James is that he‚Äôs a dramatic 21 year old. Everyone is dramatic at 21. Obviously if anything about the sexual assault allegations are true, that‚Äôd be a different story. However, just saying ‚Äúoh I heard a voice memo from someone but I‚Äôm not telling you who said it,‚Äù is not enough imo."
9080,2020-06-28 19:44:25,hh8xbg,"He was really pushy with straight guys in the DMs. But nothing close to what I've seen some men and women have said to ""shoot their shot"".

Again other than the mild stupid Ebola comments and annoying cockiness he had a year or two ago, what has he done really?"
9081,2020-06-28 19:11:58,hh8xbg,"Blaire's vid came out and couldn't watch it, I was waiting on a tldr but I haven't found anything.."
9082,2020-06-28 19:17:20,hh8xbg,I didn‚Äôt realise my view of J Star could sink even further but to blackmail someone over a rape is disgusting. Take it to the authorities if you‚Äôre in a position to do so or support the survivor. Do not use it as a way to carry on your ridiculous game of vengeance.
9083,2020-06-28 19:15:20,hh8xbg,Are there solid proofs or are we basing our assumptions on her words?
9084,2020-06-29 09:54:36,hh8xbg,A lot of people are starting to think James Charles is guilty now though. Apparently many haven‚Äôt learned from last time.
9085,2020-06-28 15:13:21,hh8xbg,"I have so much respect for that addressing of those videos. Showing actual clips that were embarrassing, not making any excuses just apologizing and feeling sick about it."
9086,2020-06-28 14:57:58,hh8xbg,"I agree, I remember making a comment about a year ago that it just didn‚Äôt really look like she was having fun anymore. I totally get that! I just have so much regret for her that after a solid decade of content that she would leave on this note. To be ‚Äúcanceled‚Äú feels like overkill for her."
9087,2020-06-28 14:59:05,hh8xbg,"I fully agree. And if this is what she needed to make the move she wanted to make for a while, that‚Äôs great for her! I just wish it wasn‚Äôt on these terms, her subs love her dearly and I feel like would be understanding in any circumstance. This is just sad for her."
9088,2020-06-28 13:37:46,hh8xbg,"@stre_ed on twitter is posting SO MANY of Shane's offensive jokes that aren't addressed in his ""apology"" video. He literally had NO BOUNDARIES for where he took these racist and pedophilia jokes. Like more and more keep coming to light"
9089,2020-06-28 13:38:26,hh8xbg,"Yes ‚Äî I should have said white fans in my comment, but my main point is that if you aren‚Äôt a part of the minority group affected, you can‚Äôt accept their apology. You can‚Äôt make excuses, you can‚Äôt ‚Äúforgive‚Äù them. I know a lot of people who think they have authority to determine if someone is or isn‚Äôt racist/homophobic/sexist etc., but they ignore PoC, LGBTQ, etc, in order to make themselves feel better about their favorite YouTuber"
9090,2020-06-29 18:34:24,hh8xbg,Oh I didn‚Äôt know! I felt the apology a way to conceal the massive swiping under the rug of his old content
9091,2020-06-28 11:57:03,hh8xbg,Damn I didn't know he quit YouTube. I just thought he got off the radar.
9092,2020-06-28 12:18:44,hh8xbg,"Yeah you're right. I'm not sure how much hate they're actually getting but from what I've seen so far, it isn't that much but you never know what's happening in the DMs"
9093,2020-06-28 11:46:58,hh8xbg,"Exactly, even some of his actions today proves this. For example, justifying Jake Pauls emotional abuse inflicted in Alissa. ‚ÄúOh, well at least it wasn‚Äôt physical abuse‚Äù .

And making a documentary on Eugenia that was a clear cash grab"
9094,2020-06-28 11:46:06,hh8xbg,"That makes a lot more sense tbh. Thanks for the explanation! I didn't know Jenna and Shane were associated with each other. However, I remember Shane and Bart Baker used to be on each other's videos so I feel like he could be the next one to get dragged. But also his career has already been going downhill for a while so idk if people would bother."
9095,2020-06-28 11:53:28,hh8xbg,"Yeah I agree with this. Ray William Johnson also has some racist clips of him from =3 (he always had the joke about hitting his black baby etc;) and Troye Sivan has a clip of him accidentally saying the N-word whilst trying to rap to Nicki Minaj on a live stream - but I don't see backlash for them and I think it's because both of them have improved themselves so much and we can see that they're good people - they have not made the same mistakes. I think the same is true with Anthony Padilla and other people (Pewdiepie, Jenna Marbles) who the internet still loves.

&#x200B;

Shane on the other hand has an entire catalogue of awful things he's said and done and has only continued to get himself involved in drama and surround himself with awful people.  I think people finally had enough of the ""I'm-gonna-say-sorry-then-do-the-same-mistake-3-seconds-later"" and are now not gonna let him off so easily."
9096,2020-06-28 12:38:47,hh8xbg,It was almost all stuff she had apologized for before. Apart from being friends with Shane. Which she sort of shrugged off in the same way Shane shrugs off being friends with Jafar et al.
9097,2020-06-28 12:24:40,hh8xbg,"I didn't know she wasn't targeted, I thought she was, addressed it and then quit. I didn't watch the video about it because when I heard it was about her quitting YouTube, I knew I wouldn't make it through the video because I've been an avid fan for years and I hate endings.

Shane is the only one that I can remember that made offensive content too. But I swear there were more. I remember watching a lot of them growing up as a kid but I just can't remember their names. Another one I could think of is Brandon Rogers, his content can get offensive but I don't think it's as bad as Smosh/Shane's old content."
9098,2020-06-28 13:40:03,hh8xbg,Exactly! They could've been taken down years ago but they were still there until last week. The Shanaynay channel is still there and nothing's been cleared from it. He doesn't care about anything until he gets called out for it
9099,2020-06-28 11:51:48,hh8xbg,I think it's so weird to me too how picky people are with who to cancel. Once I saw that Jenna was targeted I thought Smosh was definitely next to get dragged since there content was definitely more offensive than Jenna's but nothing's happened yet. I don't know about Ian as I haven't been catching up with him but Anthony has definitely changed a lot since he left Smosh
9100,2020-06-28 14:44:07,hh8xbg,"Thank you, I like jenna but wasn't the whole reason the video blew up because NO ONE was even calling her out? I know it would've been a thing at some point but for the moment everyone loves her. I think guilt and the fear of something becoming big is what got to her. I also believe she wanted to leave anyway. She. Is. Not
A. Victim."
9101,2020-06-29 03:13:43,hh8xbg,Wait what happened with chescaleigh?
9102,2020-06-29 04:04:22,hh8xbg,It's been clear for a long time that Jenna was an inch away of leaving YT.
9103,2020-06-28 22:11:10,hh8xbg,"And that's how we know it is all bullshit because I'm sure if the victim actually existed, they'd put a legal stop to Jeffree's shenanigans."
9104,2020-06-28 21:56:21,hh8xbg,"I never listened to his first apology vid. But I can only imagine it was done hastily - just to apologise and get it out there. I personally think there is some truth to Tati's statements but its hard for me to think that JC is a hardline pred*. I think he could allegedly possibly could have tried to verbally pressure someone etc. ,(not good behaviour) but I don't think he would physically force someone."
9105,2020-06-28 15:42:34,hh8xbg,"You forgot the best part of D1.

‚ÄúJ had friends, but they *didn‚Äôt publicly wish him a happy birthday,* so‚Äù"
9106,2020-06-28 14:27:46,hh8xbg,At this point it‚Äôs an annual tradition
9107,2020-06-28 14:21:05,hh8xbg,Did manny actually say racist stuff? I thought his call out was for hurting jeffrees feefees?
9108,2020-06-28 14:37:21,hh8xbg,Manny never said anything racist. He was cancelled because Jevfefe said he was a bad friend.
9109,2020-06-29 09:46:06,hh8xbg,Fixed it! I found it in Ilta-Sanomat but apparently Iltalehti has also shared the news by now.
9110,2020-06-28 17:28:56,hh8xbg,I didn‚Äôt watch the podcast sorry
9111,2020-06-29 23:31:58,hh8xbg,Self-made isn‚Äôt a thing. Who‚Äôs buying all his palettes? Who‚Äôs constructing the actual make up? Who‚Äôs shipping it out? There‚Äôs a vast team of people behind him. Even Kat Von D said she helped him get started.
9112,2020-06-30 01:09:23,hh8xbg,Sure we can
9113,2020-06-28 13:11:11,hh8xbg,"Yeah I searched for her schedule and there isn't any. She said that she will upload in the morning, so it's probably coming soon."
9114,2020-06-29 11:19:45,hh8xbg,"Thanks! I assume most people aren't buying into J\*'s bs anymore, luckily."
9115,2020-06-29 11:44:56,hh8xbg,"So...what you're saying is JC basically has grounds to sue the both of them, provided this pans out to be false? Cause if I was James, best believe I'd be retaining a lawyer for harassment/defamation, etc."
9116,2020-06-29 10:48:45,hh8xbg,"Ah, thank you. Wow, they really need to leave JC alone now jesus. What a mess."
9117,2020-06-28 18:49:34,hh8xbg,She's literally one of the people derailing the conversation. What are you talking about
9118,2020-06-28 18:40:50,hh8xbg,"‚ÄúPeople you don‚Äôt agree with politically aren‚Äôt necessarily bad people‚Äù
Yikes at your privilege and not realizing how she is racist and treats other people within the lgbt scope like trash. 
She‚Äôs trash and will forever be trash."
9119,2020-06-28 18:48:58,hh8xbg,How is white supremacy and transphobia just an opinion?
9120,2020-06-28 18:56:08,hh8xbg,Being a bigot isn't an opinion it's a character flaw
9121,2020-06-28 17:45:33,hh8xbg,They have sources and links
9122,2020-06-29 15:08:50,hh8xbg,"Yeah, for sure. Not 100% certain about this voice memo. I think Jeffree knew what he was doing by reaching out to her and she did exactly what he wanted her to."
9123,2020-06-29 15:09:05,hh8xbg,So gross. I just can't deal with all this shit lmao
9124,2020-06-29 15:08:24,hh8xbg,Good lord. The intricacies are so wild at this point. Can we get some actual good people to be stars instead? :(
9125,2020-06-29 16:10:34,hh8xbg,"> as I am a fan of hers

how can you be a fan of that horrific transphobic white supremacist?"
9126,2020-06-28 20:24:35,hh8xbg,people with personal relationships aren't required to come forward on social media to denounce something that a loved one did. You have no idea what they're doing behind the scenes and you're being toxic to say family should come under fire for something 1 person did.
9127,2020-06-28 20:35:38,hh8xbg,[deleted]
9128,2020-06-28 21:48:24,hh8xbg,I understand and that. I mean I have friends and family that have said and done things I do like and privately I will let them know I didn‚Äôt appreciate something or sometimes I will let things slide because of our relationship. Also we need to remember that Shane and Ryland are not solely Internet personalities. They have their own lives and Ryland has no obligation (in my opinion) to come forward and denounce his fianc√©s actions. That‚Äôs his family and he can handle it privately and I am expecting him to do so.
9129,2020-06-28 21:04:07,hh8xbg,Tbf I‚Äôd be more afraid of Shane stans than Shane
9130,2020-06-28 13:45:56,hh8xbg,It‚Äôs because both Jenna and Shane have deleted over a billion views on their channels I‚Äôm pretty sure
9131,2020-06-28 13:43:11,hh8xbg,I wonder if youtube is hiding this stuff currently the way they are subscriber counts on social blade
9132,2020-06-28 14:19:25,hh8xbg,Where did he even come from? He just appeared suddenly haha.
9133,2020-06-28 13:49:45,hh8xbg,[deleted]
9134,2020-06-28 20:04:07,hh8xbg,Yes people have been posting screen shots showing negative comments are getting deleted. However previously the comment section was sorted by new and now it‚Äôs not so it‚Äôs more obvious. I wasn‚Äôt completely sure at first but it‚Äôs pretty undeniable now.
9135,2020-06-29 15:32:38,hh8xbg,hey don‚Äôt insult Jamaica like that!
9136,2020-06-29 15:35:16,hh8xbg,Jizzy Soup
9137,2020-06-28 08:00:31,hh8xbg,Every dupe name I hear of him on Reddit is funnier than the last üòÇ
9138,2020-06-28 07:37:43,hh8xbg,I‚Äôm definitely interested to see what her angle is. Especially since on her instagram stories she was defending Shame ahahah. Also just remembered when jefe called Jordyn Woods a liar after red table talk. So I wonder if the Smiths will say anything about him publicly too?
9139,2020-06-28 16:23:55,hh8xbg,"It's not that deep, the only way that is possible is if J is the one sending out the deep dives of all his past shitty behaviors"
9140,2020-06-29 13:53:33,hh8xbg,"Thanks for the reply. My issue here is why suggest and not straight up say it. Im probably tinfoiling, but I've noticed that sometimes people choose certain words to cover their ass and not get blamed when the truth comes out. What if she hear only a sample of it just to listen to the voice and nothing more. Idk it seems so fishy to me"
9141,2020-06-29 00:46:56,hh8xbg,"If I were James Charles and this was untrue, I would certainly sue or at least serve Jeffree with a cease and desist for defamation. Surprised this hasn‚Äôt happened."
9142,2020-06-29 00:31:40,hh8xbg,Wait i thought it was a first person account according to blair
9143,2020-06-29 01:02:10,hh8xbg,"Really? Blaire starts explaining everything at exactly 4:00:

""He then provided me with receipts of a voice memo from a YouTuber who was allegedly sexually molested by James Charles. And it's credible. It is not my place to out this YouTuber's name at all. I have privately reached out to this YouTuber myself."" 

So it was my understanding that this came directly from the survivor, but JS obtained it through a third party."
9144,2020-06-29 01:17:23,hh8xbg,"While I think JS is manipulative, I don't think we should judge the validity of a sexual assault allegation that we don't know the details of."
9145,2020-06-29 01:34:21,hh8xbg,"I don‚Äôt know about him paying someone. It would be pretty easy to admit Jafar paid you for it, and beyond that I think something like that would really, truly ruin him for good. If there was a time for someone to come out with being paid to do this, it‚Äôs now because they would look like a hero. The consequences for coming out and saying that are pretty much all positive, so if that‚Äôs the case I think it would‚Äôve come out already."
9146,2020-06-29 00:57:25,hh8xbg,"I wouldn't say there is no victim because what ""if"" there is and they are a you tuber and do glance over this thread. Imagine how you would feel, like I shouldn't speak out because no one would even believe me

That is already a problem with average people coming forward and sharing there story.

We have to be careful what we say, this is probably the most traumatic experience of their life..

You could say rumor because thats exactly what it is. A rumor until someone speaks up."
9147,2020-06-29 00:19:13,hh8xbg,"maybe they didn‚Äôt know about her, i had never heard of her until this drama. i‚Äôm not super active in watching the drama community though."
9148,2020-06-29 00:15:50,hh8xbg,Lol the first thing I thought when reading this
9149,2020-06-29 00:51:42,hh8xbg,Because I'm not active in the drama community and don't know enough to have an opinion of her. Don't look into it too much.
9150,2020-06-29 14:06:44,hh8xbg,"That's what she said - in a video. 


She could have said it to him in private and wash her hands of it. Why is she asking her subscribers for advice? She's a clown"
9151,2020-06-29 13:59:17,hh8xbg,It also holds no legal standing if you report it for someone else. They can‚Äôt force someone to come forward.
9152,2020-06-29 14:04:12,hh8xbg,"Exactly, so why is Jeffree keeping it? 

By keeping it, he's not helping the alleged victim in any way you look at it."
9153,2020-06-29 06:15:15,hh8xbg,"For real. He deserves deplatformed, not death threats."
9154,2020-06-29 06:29:45,hh8xbg,exactly. This reminds me so much of last year with James Charles. Granted the situation is different and Shane definitely deserves to be held accountable but all this mob foaming at the mouth....yikes
9155,2020-06-29 07:07:06,hh8xbg,"Shane **should** be okay -- he's got his large house, his cute fiance waiting for him and millions in the bank. he could quit YT today and live off investments (though he & Ryland might have to move into a smaller place). he should devote the rest of his LIFE to reparations -- but he won't do that. at the very least, he **could** devote a couple of years of his income to reparations.  


but he won't. he's shown us who he values -- Jeffree Fucking Star (who clearly doesn't give a shit about Shane). pathetic."
9156,2020-06-29 09:56:15,hh8xbg,"I'm not so much worried about Shane but been stalking Morgan's and Rylands IG comments and the amount of people calling them to off themselves,white demons (verbatim) , paedos etc is worrisome. 
Shane's controversial shit was before Ryland and what in the God's green earth does Morgan have to do with it.
This dramageddon is literally knocking off some people who aren't to blame"
9157,2020-06-29 05:33:37,hh8xbg,"It has been brought up but IMO he has enough good people around him to deal with it (+therapists, inpatient ect). Not only that but it‚Äôs almost his responsibility to avoid reading comments that could upset him. He has enough money to retire and never use the internet again, so him potentially viewing negative comments is a choice.

(And although it obviously would be horrible to have the Internet turn against you, all people are doing is exposing facts. Nobodies falsely accusing him like with James. It‚Äôs his own karma coming to bite him in the ass)"
9158,2020-06-28 19:38:02,hh8xbg,"Halbert is another very young male beauty guru who got on (and fell off) around the same time as James Charles. He got canceled for reasons I don't remember and is now posting nudie pics on OnlyFans. If I remember correctly, he was always in the mix when it was drama time."
9159,2020-06-28 17:41:04,hh8xbg,This entire situation is a whole mess. It‚Äôs better to stop assuming and just wait and see what happens.
9160,2020-06-28 17:44:44,hh8xbg,And if that weren‚Äôt true I‚Äôm sure they would clarify maybe? I don‚Äôt know I mean I don‚Äôt want to call the victim a liar but I just don‚Äôt see James doing that...but we have to take these accusations seriously this isn‚Äôt tea or shade anymore.
9161,2020-06-28 19:39:13,hh8xbg,Looks like Jeffree got another party to do the dirty work for him.
9162,2020-06-28 19:36:17,hh8xbg,Same didn‚Äôt have any ads
9163,2020-06-29 13:34:22,hh8xbg,"i trust her story too, but those voice memos are still a point of contention and its on J* to bring the proof

i think he did try to manipulate her by putting her in this bad position where she cannot possibly win, shows just what a morally corrupt monster he truly is... there is literally no excuse he can come out with now even if the memo is true - he still used SA, someones effin trauma, as blackmail material. its honestly shocking how vile he is either way you look at it, he and pedo Shane truly deserve eachother..."
9164,2020-06-29 13:29:35,hh8xbg,"but why would she risk being sued? because these are really serious allegations... i hold out hope that youtubers, however vile, wouldnt use SA as clickbait"

9166,2020-06-29 17:50:53,hh8xbg,"He went on a deleting rampage lol.

It's crazy to me that all this sick content has just been sitting there, ripe for the picking.
Shows how he genuinely felt about it all along."
9167,2020-06-28 10:18:38,hh8xbg,I‚Äôm pretty sure Jenna never put ads on her videos right? I remember her saying this in a video. That could be why.edit: could also be because he‚Äôs deleted I‚Äôve 1 billion views so its saying $0 edit 2: Jenna also had deleted over a billion views so I would say this is the reason it‚Äôs saying $0 on both their social blades
9168,2020-06-28 19:26:14,hh8xbg,I see. I‚Äôll axe the comment

9170,2020-06-28 22:02:43,hh8xbg,"No, I think it has to do with privilege. White people are allowed to be ""dirty"" or unkept in public more than other races are and still be treated the same."

9178,2020-06-29 04:21:03,hh8xbg,"From what I've learned about Gemini men, their version of the ""two-faced"" stereotype isn't as apparent as female Geminis. Gemini men tend to have the ""very open, very social, very friendly"" face and the ""silent, moody, don't talk to me"" face. In terms of relationships, Geminis tend to go for rebounds harder than most signs I believe because one of those two faces is more spiteful than the other. If they have regret, they don't show it. Sorry, this is the sign I know the least about lol"
9179,2020-06-28 17:21:14,hh8xbg,We already knew that though cause of the Keemstar podcast or whatever

I didn‚Äôt notice any slip ups because I mainly took a leave of absence for his YouTube and I don‚Äôt watch drama channels, so that‚Äôs on me ! But I believe if he did something the internet would eventually explode but it didn‚Äôt ... yet.

9193,2020-06-28 19:24:46,hh8xbg,I never heard about Blair White before this. What is the run-down on her and her white suprimacy so I can be aware?
9194,2020-06-28 19:30:54,hh8xbg,How is she a white supermacist?
9195,2020-06-29 03:03:52,hh8xbg,"Yes, totally hateful to be a trans person calling out predators like Jessica Yaniv. 

I don't agree with a lot of Blaire's views but she's not transphobic for calling out predatory, misogynistic and sexist behavior that runs rampant in leftist and LGBTQI circles. And I can't speak for the rest of the stuff that you mentioned because I don't watch Blaire very frequently but that channel has done good."
9196,2020-06-29 16:53:48,hh8xbg,"Him and Shane used to work together for a bit back when Shane used to live with his mom. I think quaadir crashed over at their place for a little while he was in LA as well, but I think he saw a lot of the behind the scenes stuff"
9197,2020-06-29 21:12:38,hh8xbg,Fairly sure he wrote two autobiographical books or something.
9198,2020-06-30 03:16:15,hh8xbg,Interesting. Yeah I'll click a link. At the very beginning of all this I saw some of his old blog posts which were pretty vile from Liam's video and twitter

It was worth the question (IMO) just to gauge what people thought of SD getting an opportunity for redemption. Sorry if my post insinuated that she should have him on (I wouldn‚Äôt) and 2. We‚Äôve seen soooo many other celebrities rebuild their career after all kinds of horrific behaviours including acts with minors, it wouldn‚Äôt be surprising if in 5 years we‚Äôre seeing SD at the top again."

9232,2020-06-28 19:36:21,hh8xbg,Regardless of whether the alleged victim is saying the truth (I am absolutely not going to speculate on the truth of a potential victim's story) how do we even know that the voicememo itself is real. Think of the source. I do not put it passed J\* to manipulate a sound clip/have it be completely fake made by J\* himself. I believe that Blaire heard something that she thought was credible...but all she did was a hear a soundbit over facetime audio?? She didn't hear it in person. Did she see a date stamp? A sender? All of it seems weird and we should not participate in crucifying someone based on third party hearsay again.
9233,2020-06-28 19:24:55,hh8xbg,"repeat after me: THERE IS STILL NO PROOF. Ok? Last year we did this same shit and there were real life consequences for the people involved. If Blaire, being shitty as she is, comes out with a police report, with a video showing James doing this, or something else that it is a HARD evidence, I'll join everybody and hold James accountable. But, as of NOW, we still have no proof. This is a clear tactic to take the spotlight from Shane, who is Blaire's friend, btw."

Saying ‚Äúa man in a wig‚Äù is a put down from drag queens, because they‚Äôre all men in makeup and wigs, like J*. 

Secondly, yes I am trying to discredit him, I‚Äôm glad you got the joke. He is, without all of the power, simply a man in a wig. Is he a good one? Obviously not. 

I‚Äôm not really sure how commenting about him being a man in a wig is making this matter less serious.... I think if anything your reaction to it acting like I‚Äôm not taking it serious makes him seem more like the untouchable boogeyman you seem to think he is. He‚Äôs literally just a lucky ass human that now is worth millions and is an extreme manipulator. He can be taken down a few pegs and is that not what‚Äôs happening right now? By everyone?  It‚Äôs like the clown at the end of IT. All of the losers realize it‚Äôs not some impervious thing and that they can hurt it with their words and what they believe about it. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening with Jeffree, and the ‚Äúnot believing/ not being scary‚Äù is just people coming forward and not buying his products anymore so he doesn‚Äôt have a lot of money and ergo, isn‚Äôt a threat to anyone.

The cards just tell us where someone‚Äôs headspace or emotions might be or possibly what actions they are/have taken.  The rest is subjective.

ETA: that said I still think this reader‚Äôs interpretation is valid and worth thinking about.  But I would also say the same for any reader who interprets his cards as making him a bad person, as well."

I was just reading the energy. Even Antphrodite (youtuber that has made several posts about dramagedon and has been correct every time) he says that jeffree isn‚Äôt a bad person. I think he‚Äôs someone who makes very poor decisions and has a very bad temper.

The king of wands fell out and I felt that intuitively whoever this was about its a fire sign.

What would you say the moon and page of wands would stand for in the future?

Whenever I get the moon I always see it as you‚Äôre not supposed to know the future right now or it‚Äôs up in the air.

Thanks for your thoughts you know tarot cards well. That‚Äôs why I gave the combination so I could get other opinions :) I‚Äôm still learning them."
9274,2020-06-29 03:11:49,hh8xbg,Exactly. That‚Äôs why I did it. I just wanted to open the conversation to people who like tarot.
9275,2020-06-29 04:52:51,hh8xbg,Can you pull or give your opinion on my future outcome pulls? To clarify I asked: what‚Äôs the future outcome of this drama for all three of these individuals?
9276,2020-06-29 02:22:15,hh8xbg,What are you trying to say here?
9277,2020-06-29 05:31:37,hh8xbg,"I apologize, you're right."
9278,2020-06-28 07:15:02,hh8xbg,"I‚Äôm sorry you can‚Äôt see relevance in that. Most humans develop a moral code in their formative years, unless they‚Äôre born into complete depravity. Apparently, Jeffree did have morals and ethics. He was taught those things. He allowed himself to become morally corrupt. 
I went through PTSD therapy 10 years ago due to child abuse issues and chronic pain issues s I believe that redemption is possible. I felt like damaged goods most of my life, but therapy turned that around for me."
9279,2020-06-28 10:27:33,hh8xbg,"Jeez. I never said that the story I pasted could redeem him. I‚Äôm saying therapy can redeem you.
If it‚Äôs in fact true that he r@ped people, there will be no redemption. All facts need to come out about him. His mom‚Äôs real name, his family history. The good, bad and ugly. He‚Äôs been so secretive he even had his aunt pose as his mom for years and lied about it. Everything needs to be brought to the table."
9280,2020-06-28 07:29:27,hh8xbg,"He's 34,he was born the same year as me"
9281,2020-06-28 06:57:47,hh8xbg,You have your source that was LA Times.
9282,2020-06-29 19:12:55,hh8xbg,"man i was on some youtube channel and a tattoo artist refused to do a tattoo related to him, and people in the comments were literally saying she was a terrible person for objecting to the design idea. like how do you defend that?"

9286,2020-06-28 11:26:12,hh8xbg,He played himself as much as J* played him tbh
9287,2020-06-28 14:04:58,hh8xbg,"Europe does not want him, thank you."
9288,2020-06-28 06:06:01,hh8xbg,"I mean, she might now. Maybe she‚Äôs just jumping on this topic since it‚Äôs going to get views (honestly, while I‚Äôm glad she brought attention to the Dahvie Vanity case; how she pretty much absolved/ignored Jeffrey‚Äôs impact in that didn‚Äôt sit right with me). 
I think if anything; a youtube with a BIG following- not just a drama channel or commentary channel, actively speaking out on Jeffrey? I feel like that might just be what‚Äôs needed to encourage other people to speak out.
And I KNOW she is friends with Shane, and this is to defend him... but... i dunno. It‚Äôll be interesting to see."
9289,2020-06-28 11:05:45,hh8xbg,Is anxiety is still a trend when things get hot and you need an exuse?
9290,2020-06-28 13:34:11,hh8xbg,"Yeah, couldn't even take accountability for a 4pg rant on notes app, what makes him think he can slide blackface and child grooming slide under the rug?"
9291,2020-06-29 10:29:38,hh8xbg,"Whenever they fuck up, it‚Äôs always ‚Äúit‚Äôs a joke that I thought was funny‚Äù lol. All of them have used that excuse to the point were people are fed up and that‚Äôs not an acceptable excuse anymore."

9293,2020-06-28 06:00:58,hh8xbg,Thank you!
9294,2020-06-28 15:30:46,hh8xbg,"Y'know what, I really hope she does. I used to watch her all the time which is partially why I feel so upset about her behaviour. She comes from a place of privilege (as many beautubers do) and talks enough about her studies in social work that I just. expected/wanted her to be more intersectional in her \*my thoughts\* videos. Shane's shitty content and behaviour has always existed as a near itemized list on the internet, I just wanted her to act responsibly instead of ""being glad that he's being included in the beauty community"" like really? :c"
9295,2020-06-28 15:30:55,hh8xbg,oh thank god.
9296,2020-06-28 15:31:24,hh8xbg,I'm going to try and find a transcript of the video!
9297,2020-06-28 15:32:09,hh8xbg,No. Her mom supports him tho and wanted the conspiracy pallet and asked Hannah to order it for her since I believe her mom was working
9298,2020-06-28 15:32:32,hh8xbg,"I haven't seen receipts but I... wouldn't necessarily be surprised. Big agree on the holier than thou attitude, though."

9322,2020-06-29 18:35:53,hh8xbg,It true he‚Äôs trying to spin a narrative right now by pretending he flew away unbothered with his grandma. When it reality he didn‚Äôt do shit and is shut in at home.

Tanacon made sense, but it made him go into the bullshit of shallow ‚Äúyoutube drama‚Äù

There‚Äôs nothing substantial in that series, I could‚Äôve read everything on Reddit or on drama channels. 

Nobody needed a series on Jake Paul.

I would‚Äôve loved a series about the Defy Media debacle, getting the scoop from people from different channels, some YouTubers from that shitshow have been in the platform as long as Shane. It would‚Äôve been interesting to see how fucked up it can get in the business, help people that lost jobs and support creators that managed to land on their feet. 

I kinda was also waiting on a statement about Onision, but that never happened.

Shane has been playing with shallow LA drama. He‚Äôs completely disconnected from the real world, and real shit. And it‚Äôs coming to bite him in the ass."

I also suggest a book by Patsy Rodenburg called The Right to Speak.  I read it in my freshman year acting course and it‚Äôs all about how the body holds onto breath and tension after trauma.  Super helpful for physically releasing from difficult events"

Edit: not to completely exonerate the cops in this case. The Wikipedia article mentions the neighborhood watch was administered by their local department. And the cops in the case went on to do everything possible to defend the murder."

9362,2020-06-29 17:09:34,hh8xbg,"I don't think it was right. But Tati could've talked to him behind the scenes.

Who does that?! 

You can't ""do good"" And expect anything in return. That's not why you should help people or do good deeds. Was he a shitty friend for promoting her direct competitor for a fun weekend. Absolutely. 

Is she a horrible person too? Absolutely. She knew his behaviors and said she wanted him to stop and she even talked to him about it, but yet she continued to promote him and hangout with him because it still benefitted her. She didn't ever truly care if he was assaulting anyone or getting out of control, she condoned his behavior until he ""went against her"". That says more about her character than his."

9387,2020-06-28 06:58:37,hh8xbg,"Anthony's channel is really great.. He does these videos called ""I spent a day with.."" and picks three people to interview from really diverse lifestyles and backgrounds. It's really interesting and he really comes off as empathetic, respectful, intelligent and funny! I had never known him in his Smosh days I just randomly stumbled on his channel and I look forward to all his uploads."
9388,2020-06-29 18:47:09,hh8xbg,"Their channel was bought by Rhett and Link not too long ago. They‚Äôre kind of making a rise again. Some of their videos aren‚Äôt half bad. But it definitely isn‚Äôt the same smosh that it was like ten years ago, but that might be a good thing"
9389,2020-06-29 07:34:42,hh8xbg,"I mean, he lies about his own age and he lied about who his mother was for a while."
9390,2020-06-29 04:11:37,hh8xbg,I mean his jet is private so it‚Äôs not like flying would be an issue

9393,2020-06-28 20:08:28,hh8xbg,"According to what I remember onision saying a few years back, he was really excited to collab with Shane and make a video with him but Shane very rudely turned him down saying youtuber is ‚Äújust a job‚Äù for him. Almost like if you were talking about something you really liked and a friend just shuts you down bc they don‚Äôt think what you‚Äôre saying is all that. Then they just drifted, that‚Äôs how I remember atleast"

9396,2020-06-30 00:41:11,hh8xbg,I‚Äôm YouTube famous now
9397,2020-06-30 01:22:05,hh8xbg,Pink Palpatine is another name for Jracial Slurs.
9398,2020-06-30 01:06:39,hh8xbg,An evil character from Star Wars
9399,2020-06-28 23:23:18,hh8xbg,Yeah. There was no reason to make a different sub. I admit a lot people didnt like Shane but also most of them only complained about new shane not being funny. The minor stuff was waved away as an onision conspiracy theory.
9400,2020-06-28 23:19:24,hh8xbg,"One of them was harassing me and a few other and pulled the ""I got banned from the other shane subreddit"""

9402,2020-06-29 12:20:48,hh8xbg,"Shane seems like an EXTREMELY difficult, stubborn, unhealthy person. And that's just from what we see. I can't imagine the emotional labor that goes into maintaining a relationship with someone like him. Ryland puts in work for those Gucci slides."
9403,2020-06-29 12:29:14,hh8xbg,"> I think Ryland gets a disproportionate amount of hate for being ‚Äòmaterialistic‚Äô or people assuming hes a gold digger or whatever. 

yeah I dont watch shane but even I have ryland remembered as the ""guy with a gucci habit"" - which is ironic bcs for someone sooo into designer clothes he sure does look like the most boring ordinarily dressed guy"
9404,2020-06-29 13:36:46,hh8xbg,Tbh I don't care if his vlogs feature Shameful Drizzle. I would watch him do silly parties with Morgan and Garreth. Shame usually kills the rooms' vibe and always shows up with minimal hygiene no matter how eloquently Ryland plans the party
9405,2020-06-28 19:29:15,hh8xbg,"Ooh im ashamed to say i used to love it there because i liked garrett and drew, then the paul series happened. He was trying to stealth diagnose someone by bringing a therapist and we were all pissed off because of how stupid and crazy that is. Every thread was calling him out while twitter and youtube was calling for a netflix documentary. Like... this shit wouldnt even work in a highschool project. Netflix would pay him to leave the building."

9408,2020-06-28 12:23:41,hh8xbg,How are the Kardashians friends with the Smiths considering they tried to completely railroad Jordyn Woods ?
9409,2020-06-28 12:02:50,hh8xbg,"They absolutely DETEST Jeffree. They‚Äôre royalty too, Shane is done"
9410,2020-06-28 14:39:17,hh8xbg,True I feel sorry for her

9412,2020-06-29 02:24:35,hh8xbg,A person as destructive as Jeffree is inevitably self destructive as well. He sees the goal of wrecking others and cannot sit down and think how much it may hurt him too
9413,2020-06-29 11:12:03,hh8xbg,Thanks. I'm quite proud of this one. My most meaningful work of 2020.
9414,2020-06-28 07:47:50,hh8xbg,I‚Äôm so sorry that this happened to you. I‚Äôm sending you a lot of love. I had an incident with a group of adult men when I was 14. It also changed the way I deal with relationships and intimacy.
9415,2020-06-28 08:25:17,hh8xbg,"Just wanted to let you know you‚Äôre not alone.

Had an online man in his 40s groom me when I was 14/15. It still fucks with me.

I‚Äôm seeing more and more stories like this yet I haven‚Äôt seen support groups etc for it"
9416,2020-06-28 07:08:31,hh8xbg,"Same, and I‚Äôm sorry you went through that. Are you coping okay? ‚ù§Ô∏è"
9417,2020-06-28 23:53:51,hh8xbg,"Yes, they were. It was actually a huge point of contention towards one narrative around the whole situation last year."
9418,2020-06-29 12:36:22,hh8xbg,I think it actually ended up benefiting Manny. He stayed clear of drama after that and he seems a lot more happy in his videos which make his content more enjoyable.
9419,2020-06-29 12:50:09,hh8xbg,"I didn't like his old stuff because he did come across as fake. And, as an older woman, I felt a bit aged on his videos. Like they were a bit immature for me. But now I like his content and think he's adorable. Plus, tbh, I found his old stuff boring. It was almost like he sold his soul to Morphe and for PR packages and sponsors and all he did was rave over half-assed products.

Now, though, after everyone ""dumped"" him, I trust him much more and actually really like his content. He's not over the top gushing about products he's affiliated with but he's also not overly harsh, either. If he likes something he says it but explains why in a way I, as a novice, can understand. If he doesn't like something, he says it and I understand why. I especially pay attention whenever he says something is overpriced. That always makes me sit up and take note because we're a house of three women, two who love makeup (my kids), and me who loves and needs really good skincare.

I also like the way he packages his products and how affordable they are. I don't feel like I'm buying junk but I also feel like I'm getting a quality product at a really, really good price. Especially when he has his magnificent sales. (PS, Manny, if you're reading this, have another sale and help a girl out!).

Honestly, I wish he'd do more skincare videos.

Edited because I can."
9420,2020-06-29 14:30:17,hh8xbg,That sounds pretty correct to me
9421,2020-06-28 12:50:25,hh8xbg,"Lol @ me last week ""gonna focus on my final project"" ... That dumb b*tch"
9422,2020-06-28 15:58:13,hh8xbg,"It's not that simple because Jafar probably owns shares in it. It would be possible for perhaps other shareholders to ""buy him out"", but that seems unlikely as it is a private company (I believe)."
9423,2020-06-28 16:10:10,hh8xbg,"Pretty sure the boxing match was the way out. So, maybe Shame can fight Jafar or JC?"

9428,2020-06-29 18:12:30,hh8xbg,Very accurate.
9429,2020-06-29 19:40:02,hh8xbg,Not even a remote chance that this is drama related.
9430,2020-06-29 19:37:16,hh8xbg,Oh they‚Äôre gonna say nothing about it
9431,2020-06-29 19:40:44,hh8xbg,where did this rumor come from
9432,2020-06-29 20:12:30,hh8xbg,Ah thanks for letting me know! I doubt it's drama related. I just hope if j* pulls some shit out of his ass like the voice memo (which i actually assume could be faked) that James has proof to say it wasn't him.
9433,2020-06-29 19:34:17,hh8xbg,No.
9434,2020-06-29 23:48:15,hh8xbg,Yeah Peter is one of us

9448,2020-06-29 17:47:52,hh8xbg,"I always reported the ads whenever I see it pops up anywhere because the thought of a scam that targets people trying to get help is really nauseating. There was a point in my life where I needed help feeling safe and to do ‚Äòregular‚Äô daily activities. If the ads was there back then, I would have fallen for the scam because the appeal of having my therapist to be a message away instead of calling to make an appointment etc."
9449,2020-06-29 08:47:51,hh8xbg,Yes and Garrett looked so uncomfortable ! Like whenever Jeffree said something sexual towards him Garrett didn‚Äôt respond he‚Äôd just awkward laugh

9462,2020-06-29 09:07:51,hh8xbg,I can see how that might be true
9463,2020-06-28 06:23:27,hh8xbg,"True he choose him. And agreed, I‚Äôm just saying, that‚Äôs a paradigm of thinking, sticking to blood no matter what."
9464,2020-06-28 05:53:53,hh8xbg,"Bruh. It was like: 

‚ÄúShane: You don‚Äôt have to accept my apology.

Everyone: OK we won‚Äôt.

Shane: 
üëÅüëÑüëÅ‚Äù

As in that‚Äôs what J* said. From his ride or die best friend?! Come on Shane. Wake up."
9465,2020-06-28 15:44:06,hh8xbg,"I mean friends should absolutely hold each other accountable and call out shitty behavior, but friends also shouldn‚Äôt drop each other when the going gets tough. If Jeffree were to drop Shane now that the public heat has been cranked to a hundred, and NOT earlier in private when he maybe first learned about just how deep Shane‚Äôs racism went then Jeffree‚Äôs a shittier person than we already think. 

You‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs not a good idea for them to defend each other right now. During this apology-purge, when people are really reaching/reading between the lines and dragging people for not wording their apologies in a very precise way, the last thing they should be trying to say is ‚Äúbut they‚Äôve gotten better.‚Äù 

I wish Shane would‚Äôve gone into way more depth on the second half of his apology video. Instead of just blanket statement-ing that ‚Äúit‚Äôs not true, I didn‚Äôt stir drammegeddon 2‚Äù he should‚Äôve done a deep dive into where the allegations are coming from, WHY Sanders maybe read the situation the way he did. And if after all that digging, after asking all the people who were there that night, pulling phone records, whatever has to be done, you have ZERO proof you made the alleged phone call about James? Then say it. And if there is proof? Talk about the context of the phone call. Try connect the dots. For all we know Shane was just pissed that James bought the same pair of shoes as him, and Jeffree fucking ran with it (I could be wrong but I don‚Äôt think Sanders really went into detail about what Shane said specifically about James)? 

Same with his friends. It‚Äôs great he can recognize his biases, but tell us what the change will look like. Does Jeffree get a grace period to not fuck up anymore? Are you done after his next scandal? Are you reigning back the relationship until you see positive change from him? Details man. All the people speculating that Shane can‚Äôt do that because of contracts need to remember that J* the person exists independently of JSC. The contractually obliged business relationship must continue, but the personal one doesn‚Äôt. 

If I were Shane I would‚Äôve donated the restock money to a black charity or two. Sure, it‚Äôs a little reminiscent of the South Park episode where Cartman thinks he‚Äôs dead and makes the people he wronged fruit baskets in order to escape ‚Äúpurgatory,‚Äù but at least it‚Äôs something. 

Talk is cheap during this phase of accountability, actions are everything. Rant over, thanks for coming to my Ted Talk lol."

9468,2020-06-28 16:24:32,hh8xbg,Is the thing that what Shane did to Dan and Phil true?
9469,2020-06-28 23:50:49,hh8xbg,Wow that just sounds like it makes the legitimacy of its contents a lot less plausible. If he‚Äôs not just lying to cover his ass.
9470,2020-06-29 00:06:52,hh8xbg,Yes. Because Jeffree Star never lies.
9471,2020-06-29 15:18:10,hh8xbg,ahh that memo. i thought it was referring to a new one lol. thanks
9472,2020-06-29 15:18:46,hh8xbg,thank you!
9473,2020-06-29 16:11:53,hh8xbg,Id say donate them or depot them and put them into a blank palette
9474,2020-06-29 16:07:07,hh8xbg,I am in the same boat as you. I started learning about all his past like a month ago. I am trying to sell everything I ever bought with his name on it. I feel disgusting having his products in my home
9475,2020-06-29 18:42:02,hh8xbg,"i think jeffree is the starter youtuber for beauty (based on the algorithm). you start watching and hell eventually be recommended to you until you find the people that you click with. 

I watched him in the beginning, and i guess i liked the video personality. 

And i will admit i briefly did believe his i'm sorry for being racist video. But after the jackie aina stuff, and hearing just how bad his past was. Plus all of the other stuff, i just had to stop and tell youtube to not recommend him."
9476,2020-06-29 15:43:05,hh8xbg,"I remember during the palette advertisement I went on the comment section in there and shat  on Jeffree thinking the consensus would be the same... my god I was wrong. ‚ÄúHE‚ÄôS A GENIUS BUSINESSMAN!‚Äù The fuuuuck?

9479,2020-06-29 17:41:05,hh8xbg,Yeah this is part of the reason I made this comment.

But now Blaire White is out here saying the voice memo is a credible proof. I'm thinking of going back to the podcast again to see word for word what J\* said. Some people said he got a recording of someone telling him about a JC 'victim', some said that the recording is OF the victim. I think this is how rumors get started and it's best to clear that now."
9483,2020-06-29 17:02:42,hh8xbg,"Yeah that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre saying. He had no issue giving ashlye the dirt but didn‚Äôt cough up the voice memo to her. If he wanted her unwavering support he could have had her or any of the other drama channels listen to it and they could scream to the sky about how they heard it. And it‚Äôs definitely true. And it‚Äôs INDISPUTABLE evidence. 

But only two people have confirmed they heard it???? Excuse me??"

I only watched that video for a minute before I closed it down. All her faking is really offensive and gross and hurtful. 
AFAIK she made three vids about her ‚ÄúDID‚Äù and then never spoke of it again. Maybe she did, I don‚Äôt watch her but that‚Äôs how she works."
9488,2020-06-28 12:26:58,hh8xbg,"Trisha came at DissociaDID in a couple of videos that were extremely triggering for their system. Kyle released a video about how they‚Äôre gonna take a break but that‚Äôs the last I‚Äôve heard of them I think?

Ooh boy. Team Pi√±ata has since deactivated all social media. Some things from Nan‚Äôs past came to light where he drew some questionable things with ... fictional characters that are minors. And there was this whole ordeal on Instagram and YouTube for this (YT is where I got most sources). Since then, DissociaDID condemned the actions of Team Pi√±ata (I think they have taken down the post) but no one is aware if they‚Äôve broken up or not. There are no pics of Nin and Nan together on their Instagram anymore from what I heard."
9489,2020-06-28 12:20:40,hh8xbg,"As far as I‚Äôm aware they‚Äôre still not back online. It was horrible to watch unfold. DissociaDID had a lot of attention on them after the Anthony Padilla collab but of course Trasha had to come out of the woodworks and put extra pressure and stress on them, accused them of faking their illness and she claimed that she in fact had DID. I‚Äôve watched Trisha do a lot of shitty things but THAT was the straw that broke the camels back. She pretended to have alters for a few videos after, wore a dreadlock wig in one."

9493,2020-06-28 20:55:45,hh8xbg,"He just doesn't want anyone above him in his field. He wants to be the #1. It's all about winning and numbers for him. You could tell his particular mindset from that podcast he did, the Mom's Basement. 

He wants to be his own superstar."
9494,2020-06-28 21:05:13,hh8xbg,I think at this point J* just wants to make sure James goes down with him.
9495,2020-06-28 21:07:35,hh8xbg,"Theres a lot of negative attention on shane. Shane and jeffree are partners in a way, who stand to make continued millions.

9496,2020-06-28 20:56:13,hh8xbg,"I really don't know, the narrative has been flipped and speculated over so many times who knows what the truth is anymore? 

J* is and always has been for himself. He will do anything to protect him, his brand or image even if it means going against his ""friends."""
9497,2020-06-28 20:53:26,hh8xbg,Omg with the battle ship noises of course cause its gotta be bougie
9498,2020-06-29 02:32:44,hh8xbg,Thank you! üíñ
9499,2020-06-29 03:47:57,hh8xbg,I would not even let him adopt a pet after the stuff he has done.  Imagine a child.
9500,2020-06-29 04:12:05,hh8xbg,"Yikes, I didn't even think that far ahead. Ryland has been pretty open about wanting to have a family, so that's... probably not going to be an easy pill to swallow if this does make adopting much harder."
9501,2020-06-28 12:00:09,hh8xbg,He won't... we've seen this done before by him.  If he does he'll just delete the negative comments..
9502,2020-06-29 09:37:49,hh8xbg,Are you sure about them staying out of drama? Didnt they film with shane and jeffree after dram2? That was a pretty bold move there.
9503,2020-06-29 09:24:04,hh8xbg,"agreed.

(at first I was like who tf is Joe schmoe lol)"
9504,2020-06-29 09:17:32,hh8xbg," emma chamberlain and over other 30 people, don't know exactly who"
9505,2020-06-29 10:13:14,hh8xbg,Yeah she still supports him even after everything that came out. I mean girl come on (her not you). She does not get a pass from me.
9506,2020-06-29 13:22:12,hh8xbg,Was on her insta a day ago
9507,2020-06-29 13:44:57,hh8xbg,"I mean, they helped Shane making a skit that sexualizes 8-year-old girl..."
9508,2020-06-29 13:42:23,hh8xbg,"If you check out timestamp 2:33 via the link below, you can see he channels his mom in this outfit he wears in this music video about turning a little boy gay. I don‚Äôt know what that woman was doing behind closed doors when Shane was a kid. [LINK](https://youtu.be/hgqibhR4jj4)

EDIT: by the way, I don‚Äôt personally feel you can turn someone gay. That is literally what Shane is singing about in his song. Which is also really weird and demented."
9509,2020-06-29 16:54:57,hh8xbg,I‚Äôd have found the worst possible photo of him and just made it worse tbh. Him and juvederm scrotum don‚Äôt deserve nice photos of them to be used at this point
9510,2020-06-29 17:04:43,hh8xbg,"I read a conspiracy on here yesterday that their relationship was fake.

I'm starting to believe that"
9511,2020-06-29 17:16:20,hh8xbg,"Sometimes with public figures it‚Äôs done fairly early on. It‚Äôs like a cya for a lot of folx. 

Now, they are usually pretty difficult to enforce and especially if there‚Äôs crimes witnessed or coercion to sign that is automatically unenforceable. 
However, J* has litigation hell money."
9512,2020-06-28 20:43:56,hh8xbg,"Oh I got it now, I had no clue she was a YTer"
9513,2020-06-29 04:30:26,hh8xbg,"Yeah, I feel bad for the kids who refuse to cancel him because his videos made them laugh. Like, there are tons of proper, unproblematic comedians in the world that they'll never know."
9514,2020-06-28 07:00:23,hh8xbg,I feel like the Smiths need to find out about Dahvie and then how shame associates and praises Dahvie's best bud jingleheimer schmit
9515,2020-06-28 16:12:16,hh8xbg,What notification?
9516,2020-06-28 23:59:53,hh8xbg,"Exactly!! But he‚Äôll start beef with ANYONE, even his own fans for no reason lol what are they even supporting 

Like why would 10 year odd mason care about Jeffree‚Äôs bank account from before he was born? Im an adult and I don‚Äôt"
9517,2020-06-29 02:59:36,hh8xbg,it was and mason was 100% correct lmao
9518,2020-06-29 00:01:13,hh8xbg,he was in a really dark place
9519,2020-06-30 03:37:59,hh8xbg,I mean... that‚Äôs still yikes
9520,2020-06-30 02:00:02,hh8xbg,"Ooh I‚Äôm not familiar with that one. I used to be part of a snarky as hell planning group and we created our own reaction emojis. This one happened around the time that spicer hid in the bushes from the press. I thought it had to do with that. 

If there‚Äôs a whole bother meaning to this I‚Äôll be the one slinking into the bushes haha. I honestly use this daily. üò©"
9521,2020-06-30 02:00:40,hh8xbg,Btw- you just made the year for me commenting on it. For some reason this little emoji makes me so happy haha.
9522,2020-06-30 00:12:54,hh8xbg,"Oh I‚Äôm well aware of the terrible tragedy. I‚Äôm an old fogie and watched that sad mess unfold real time. 

My exclamation was more in regards to why on earth would that be something one would tattoo. It‚Äôs really upsetting what happened to the poor bairn and no one was ever charged for her murder. So sad."
9523,2020-06-28 15:52:00,hh8xbg,"Yes that is true, I think. He brought this upon himself and now JS is probably thrilled."
9524,2020-06-28 10:38:22,hh8xbg,I‚Äôve noticed it on sale (the Morphe x JS collection) at Ulta for at least 2 weeks or more.
9525,2020-06-28 20:25:39,hh8xbg,He's gotten away with it because lol Shane's a comedian. What a ü§°.
9526,2020-06-28 21:39:59,hh8xbg,"Someone mentioned that, weird because she also has been liking things against JS"
9527,2020-06-28 21:37:24,hh8xbg,isn't he always being cancelled??? Like he lives in a state of constant cancellation
9528,2020-06-28 21:51:02,hh8xbg,"Unless there is proof of keemstar committing child predatory behaviour or sexual assault, there‚Äôs no chance he‚Äôs getting cancelled IMO, he‚Äôs survived this long"
9529,2020-06-28 23:46:14,hh8xbg,I feel like anyone who was between 10 and 15 that watched that era of Shane‚Äôs content got worse because of him. Most of us were able to grow up and realize how to be good people but he basically gave an entire generation messed up views on comedy.
9530,2020-06-29 03:26:50,hh8xbg,"I think most people coming out and ""exposing"" all these major YouTubers are trying to deflect off Shane and J\*. Trisha and Blare White have their own problematic pasts and know better than others how to keep the narrative changing. Most Shane and J\* fans are really young. If you confuse them enough they're going to stand by their favorites and try to deflect to the ones they don't really like.

My theory is this:

People learned about J\* through videos like Liam McEvoy's two-parter and the ones exposing his relationship with Dhavie (or however you spell his name). J\* starts trying to take videos like that and the images off the internet. It doesn't work. People are PISSED and want answers and he knows they will not like the answers they receive.

Shane tries to deflect the heat J\* is taking by writing his diatribe on Twitter and put the focus back on James Charles. Since Tati has gone MIA and is now Tweeting out various cryptic messages it alllllmost worked. But didn't. Because now people are focused on Shane.

Shane's Twitter rant/response/reasoning goes under fire immensely and HE'S sitting on the hot seat. Everyone in the YT problematic community is waiting for J\* to speak up and stop the hate. Only the shit-show got too big for even the Queen of Bothersome herself. Like mainstream media is now picking up on what an awful person Shane is. His career is pretty much over. There's no amount of bumbling idiot poor person lookalike he can do to get out of this one.

Trisha tries to deflect some of the heat off Shane and J\* by going after whoever she can while steadfastly being loyal to them. She picks Gabby at first because Gabby is an easy target. But that backfires now that Peter Monn came out and demanded Gabby address if J\* and Shane are really the racist everyone says they are. Now the focus is back on J\* and Shane, so she has to go after whoever David and his friends are.

Meanwhile...

Blare White, who is probably still friends with J\* and definitely friends with Shane, has come out with her video. And to many it seems as though she's hitting hard on J\* (but not anything he can't handle). Instead, she alludes to what James Charles supposedly did. So now the focus has shifted off Shane and J\* and is on James Charles.

The problem is these people don't realize they can all be de-platformed in a hot minute. Let's face it. Shane's career is over. J\*'s is next unless he does something drastic like solve world hunger. James's best move is to address this mysterious voice memo and admit to whatever might be on it before it's made public. 

But Blare and Trisha are also going down. No one is going to want to be within one hundred yards of them if they continue to be friends with Shane and J\*. Honestly, defending J\* and Shane is, as Bea Lucille said, like moving furniture on the Titanic."
9531,2020-06-29 02:29:08,hh8xbg,I did too lol
9532,2020-06-29 02:42:22,hh8xbg,oh i 100% believe her too but I'm worried the general public wont
9533,2020-06-29 16:15:05,hh8xbg,"That's a really good point! I didn't really follow dramagedon 1 because I didnt follow any of the people involved but I was totally aware that Laura Lee was not as well liked. It's much easier to cancel someone who you already dont like, much harder to be critical or someone you look up to or idolize."
9534,2020-06-29 23:06:29,hh8xbg,I'm guessing theyre probably videos defending shane at some point.
9535,2020-06-29 23:07:44,hh8xbg,"I don't either but I know when his videos are late he usually posts updates there. :)

And you're welcome!"
9536,2020-06-28 12:59:27,hh8xbg,He should punish himself by deleting all his channels.
9537,2020-06-28 17:44:07,hh8xbg,*swirls big ugly mirror around*
9538,2020-06-28 20:53:48,hh8xbg,"Also the T-Series thing. I subbed as a previous fan then, watched like three of his videos since, and now I just passively watch the thumbnails of his new videos pop up in my feed and move on lol"
9539,2020-06-29 03:51:10,hh8xbg,But on Twitter
9540,2020-06-29 03:40:00,hh8xbg,I‚Äôm on his IG right now and he is not.
9541,2020-06-28 17:46:20,hh8xbg,"Exactly, J* found the perfect way to sway public opinion in his favor, and against James, all while not having to show any receipts whatsoever..."
9542,2020-06-28 23:32:36,hh8xbg,"This, yes! JS has been playing blackmail puppetmaster since he came up, he knows enough to put himself one step ahead"
9543,2020-06-28 07:38:11,hh8xbg,"I‚Äôm probably just sleep deprived and need a solid 10 hour nap, but I‚Äôm not understanding the reference. üò≠Do you mind explaining to my fried brain?"
9544,2020-06-28 07:57:37,hh8xbg,"Well, I always really liked Garret. I think it was wise to stay the fuck away from all of this."
9545,2020-06-28 07:24:02,hh8xbg,Thank you!! Makes me curious what Andrew thinks now. Hmm...
9546,2020-06-28 07:38:31,hh8xbg,Lmaoo Thanks for linking
9547,2020-06-28 14:31:14,hh8xbg, i thought it was just him and his mom that got fired
9548,2020-06-28 15:08:18,hh8xbg,Wait seriously? I need to look into this lol
9549,2020-06-28 15:23:52,hh8xbg,Oh. How lovely.
9550,2020-06-28 17:37:31,hh8xbg,Like it‚Äôs just gross.... who think it‚Äôs funny for a puppet that is suppose to be a child making constant vulgar jokes that I as a grown women would never make!
9551,2020-06-28 15:43:44,hh8xbg,"I think so too, I also think Garrett saw SD changing and not for the better. Although if SD has been racist long before meeting Jafar the question is why now?"
9552,2020-06-28 16:12:01,hh8xbg,"I thought it was cringe when J* asked Shane how much to have sex with Garrett. And he said he'd pay ~~a month's rent~~ his rent for a few months.

Although, I have pointed this out before that Garrett went to the J* x Morphe launch. So he wasn't trying to avoid him then."
9553,2020-06-28 23:00:57,hh8xbg,"Anytime mate, hope all sorts itself!"
9554,2020-06-28 17:25:27,hh8xbg,It didn't stop him from sharing it with other people
9555,2020-06-28 22:09:51,hh8xbg,"Oh, sorry. There are so many posts about Shane‚Äôs pedophilia I‚Äôm having issues in my brain keeping track."
9556,2020-06-29 18:32:00,hh8xbg,üòÇ I know I'm asking for too much lol
9557,2020-06-29 18:11:05,hh8xbg,Imagine if ANY of them did üòÅ lol it's be like they were actually journalists uncovering a story *facepalm*
9558,2020-06-29 19:30:20,hh8xbg,"I love Jenna, and I'm sad for her. But she needed to distance herself from Shane. She didn't and he immediately tried to drag her down with him. She was loyal to the wrong people unfortunately."
9559,2020-06-29 19:40:28,hh8xbg,My dumbass is trying to figure this out in European time
9560,2020-06-29 21:40:14,hh8xbg,Or because it a) doesn't exist or b) is severely less damaging third-party-bullsh*t and Jofeffe knew sharing it would be showing his fake hand
9561,2020-06-29 21:28:26,hh8xbg,"I mean... I‚Äôm not an expert. As far as I‚Äôm aware; if it was sent in a Voice message/note (similar to what was released from Jeffrey to Kam Lester (which I believe Jeffrey released); I think it would be similar to showing a text message/email. Like despite the content of it; and it being MORALLY wrong; I think it falls under the same ‚Äúfair game‚Äù sort of thing as releasing a text message or the voice note from Jeffree to Kam. 

IF it was a phone call/private conversation- AND it occurred in LA then it needs to be two party consent; so that would be illegal. 

I mean- depending where Grandma Lynn supposedly lives; maybe he can get around two party consent by going to a one party consent state and releasing it there? But I think it‚Äôs dependent on where it‚Äôs recorded. Again: not an expert."
9562,2020-06-29 21:23:41,hh8xbg,The marie kondo of drama
9563,2020-06-28 16:06:57,hh8xbg,"Surely those videos couldn't still have been monetised? Don't people get demonetised just for talking about things that are illegal? And (regular, non-slur) swearing?

Like I know that back in the day they weren't so strict. But surely when they got stricter they would've stopped being monetised or something"
9564,2020-06-29 19:21:05,hh8xbg,Yup ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è the beuatuber community is pretty damn rife with it
9565,2020-06-28 15:59:58,hh8xbg,I know. I‚Äôm saying in glad someone is talking about him rather then SD.

9570,2020-06-28 07:30:16,hh8xbg,Can you honestly say you have a better way to predict how this year will turn out? I started watching for entertainment and still do but he keeps being right about YouTube drama lol

9574,2020-06-28 11:20:33,hh8xbg,yeah cryaotic just confessed that he was a child groomer and that he took advantage of his young fans. his fans praised him for being brave.
9575,2020-06-28 19:38:39,hh8xbg,"She demonetized the video. I watched it myself and there were no ads; plus, she confirmed it in an Instagram story"
9576,2020-06-28 18:51:59,hh8xbg,"...and adsense. Has everyone forgotten that Ashlye Kyle showed she made $37,000 off of making drama videos about j*?"
9577,2020-06-28 17:48:53,hh8xbg,We have to keep going after Jafar. We can‚Äôt let him get out of this.
9578,2020-06-28 21:00:07,hh8xbg,"Me too, and it's even worse because Morrissey is a big bag of d*cks (love the band's music, can't stand that dingbat), and 2020 has been insane, so it wouldn't surprise me if he got somehow embroiled in this. I keep having to check to see which Smiths we're talking about."

GET IT?!?!"

9581,2020-06-28 13:56:47,hh8xbg,"He was very, very involved with Shane for a long time. Even opened a business together with other youtubers around 2011, maker studios. If he does call him out I'll be surprised because he was definitely aware, at least on some level. Absolutely no way he wasn't and I think he doesn't want to talk about it because he knows he'll have to either own up to that or risk getting called out by those of us who would know he was lying if he tried to pretend he didn't."
9582,2020-06-29 13:24:52,hh8xbg,"I would change ""sad"" to scary. To have someone relentlessly come after you like that is frightening. I mean J* brought it up again a whole year later. You notice how 2 influencers have said they are ""scared for their life"" when it comes to J*"
9583,2020-06-29 15:17:48,hh8xbg,"You know what, I can‚Äôt find it anywhere and I can‚Äôt find anyone else talking about it either! I don‚Äôt want to be spreading false information so I‚Äôve deleted that comment."
9584,2020-06-28 20:34:39,hh8xbg,"I agree, if she was really concerned she should‚Äôve consulted with the authorities not with YouTube viewers."
9585,2020-06-28 20:30:17,hh8xbg,"I agree Idk why she says she couldn‚Äôt go to the police. Quite frankly I would‚Äôve. Even if it was done privately this needs to be investigated. 

I don‚Äôt condone any of that shit that‚Äôs disgusting and wrong. I just mean either 1) it happened and why aren‚Äôt the police involved where is the fury on this 2) it didn‚Äôt happen and jeffree can be sued for slander at this point"
9586,2020-06-28 21:19:42,hh8xbg,I swear people always just want her to be in the wrong because of her political beliefs lol
9587,2020-06-28 16:27:18,hh8xbg,"I'm not sure. There was an Epstein doc that just came out too, might be about that and not actually related to Shane at all."
9588,2020-06-28 12:37:28,hh8xbg,We just gotta keep eating him alive
9589,2020-06-28 12:18:36,hh8xbg,"For some reason I can't see shane releasing dirt on jafar to take attention away from himself. Even if he does it, it'll be in an anger filled twitter rant, not as smartly as jafar has done in the past."
9590,2020-06-28 12:07:16,hh8xbg,It can‚Äôt come fast enough. Jeffree is literally rasputin incarnate
9591,2020-06-28 13:55:35,hh8xbg,"Yeah, but i think as you said it wasn't as big of a collab and Jefveve deffo had the upper hand on that, being richer and more influential etc. Whereas now, Shane and Jefeces kinda have the same influence i'd say"
9592,2020-06-28 14:52:40,hh8xbg,"How sad that he realizes he should distance himself from it at least enough to do that, but then leaves up disgusting shit to profit off of. I wonder if the $ was worth it cuz half the shit we're seeing wouldn't be coming out if he had deleted it when he switched channels"
9593,2020-06-28 21:18:32,hh8xbg,Ayyee
9594,2020-06-28 21:22:00,hh8xbg,Massachusetts here!
9595,2020-06-29 23:04:49,hh8xbg,Did moms basement come out before or after Tati went missing?
9596,2020-06-29 22:19:48,hh8xbg,"Damn I had no clue that happened, where the fuck have I been"
9597,2020-06-30 01:17:01,hh8xbg,Yeah I saw that after my comment ü§°
9598,2020-06-28 13:35:00,hh8xbg,"Agreed, I've been very present on the Internet since early 2000s before Youtube. Racist and pedophilia jokes were NEVER as mainstream as people like to claim they were... There was things like pedobear and such, but that was only fringe 4chan humor. I agree with /u/Fystikovoutiro that homophobic and transphobic jokes were more common/accepted, as well as violent threats poised as jokes."
9599,2020-06-28 13:57:23,hh8xbg,"Yeah he‚Äôs only a year older than me, pedo jokes were never okay?? Blackface was also never okay?! People made ‚Äúdead baby‚Äù jokes a lot and some people made racist jokes but it wasn‚Äôt so different a time that the stuff Shane did was acceptable then."

9602,2020-06-30 04:18:10,hh8xbg,CONGRATULATIONS on five and a half years! Some of J*‚Äôs angry tweets always sound like something drunk me would tweet lmao it has made me wonder before
9603,2020-06-28 15:36:16,hh8xbg,If he‚Äôs poor then I must be dead already.
9604,2020-06-28 15:25:07,hh8xbg,"You're not disappointed in Shane and happy to see these videos? Ew right back, Jesus."
9605,2020-06-28 20:12:45,hh8xbg,How convenient
9606,2020-06-28 20:15:35,hh8xbg,"She's up to her old tricks, just like what she did when using Tehmimi's video discussing Jamilov Sycamore's involvement with Dahvie."
9607,2020-06-28 20:35:12,hh8xbg,He REALLY wanted to show FaZe Banks from memory; but he didn‚Äôt want to get involved.
9608,2020-06-28 20:33:56,hh8xbg,"It's actually really interesting because J* offers twice - it sounds as though one of them (I'm not sure who) is about to decline, but J* sort of talks over them and says that he doesn't want to out a victim of JC. Then he says that everyone accuses him of destroying JC's career but he didn't do that, Tati did, and then he talks about how they had no reason to try and bring down JC, yadda yadda. 

I really get the impression that he didn't want to play the memo. Why is anyone's guess."
9609,2020-06-29 01:45:36,hh8xbg,"Hardly. She called out his actions so she wouldn't get caught in the drama and to give the video a better sense of legitimacy. 

The result of that video is that it started to derail all the attention being on Shane. Which is it's intended purpose."
9610,2020-06-29 02:56:29,hh8xbg,"You have more patience than me. Just the clips made me sooo mad. The one where he is like ""who cares about you stupid irrelevant actors"" really pissed me off"

9612,2020-06-29 09:34:18,hh8xbg,"I hope he's suing Jadrama Slur tbh. It's not acceptable that he's pushing this narrative based on a voice memo among his peers. J\*''s & Tati's stans are already jumping to conclusions, based on a voice memo which in of itself does not automatically constitute proof."

9627,2020-06-28 15:45:47,hh8xbg,It‚Äôs actually annoying me that people are like ‚Äòwell he might not actually be a predator... innocent until proven guilty‚Äô but like??? We have videos that HE put on the internet where he‚Äôs creeping on kids and making his cousin do fucked up stuff. At *the very least* he is a confirmed sexual abuser
9628,2020-06-28 19:32:47,hh8xbg,"Oh for sure. He cant release it because then he outs a victim, which is beyond awful. But he needs it out to 'validate' him."
9629,2020-06-28 19:23:24,hh8xbg,THIS right here
9630,2020-06-28 20:46:05,hh8xbg,"J* said on the podcast that the voice memo is not a ""testimony"" from the victim. So it sounds like it's a 3rd party."
9631,2020-06-28 20:54:00,hh8xbg,"Watch, it will turn out that the memo is just Rich Lux telling a made up story for J Stain."
9632,2020-06-28 20:48:05,hh8xbg,"I just pulled it up again and as far as I can tell, this is what he said: 'someone told us a few things. And we trusted that person's opinion. And then another person said some things that was friends with that man and it really convinced us that he was a predator."" 

To me that sounds like he's saying that he heard from the person themselves and also from someone else?

Edit: But also, it's a 45 min podcast and I don't wanna listen to the whole thing so maybe I've missed something, haha.

Edit: further on, one of them says 'you do have a testimony from an alleged victim in your possession, that's what you're saying?"" and J* doesn't say anything, and someone else says 'yeah, that's what he's saying' and J* just says 'call my lawyer'. And then they go on to talk about how j* is a billionaire, etc. Honestly, he really sort of talks around really pinning it down."
9633,2020-06-28 22:56:14,hh8xbg,"yeah before it was just ""Prove Shane and Jeffree Pushed her into making this video and that shane was involved!!!""

Now it's ""There is most probably a voice memo out there and you cannot prove it one way or the other unless a victim comes forward or someone is insane enough to somehow sue jafar into the dirt for making it up""

Like I cannot see a way to handle this at all. And yet at the same time I think Tati is the only person right now who could even hope to really be able to go against Jeffree in any capacity. Because she has the platform and was involved in the drama last year and she is not the accused.

&#x200B;

And it's still just sick that Jeffree is blaming this all on her. As though he isn't running around slinging this to everyone and trying to get others to do his dirty work for him.

&#x200B;

Edit: Oh. unless youtube stepped in and literally kicked him off the platform. That would be .... Interesting."

9669,2020-06-28 20:17:44,hh8xbg,"Before I understood the system, I too would say to just go to the police and that‚Äôs a perfectly reasonable thing to say and what we *should* be able to say with confidence. Let me tell you - seeing how it really is up close is heartbreakingly disappointing and it‚Äôs a shitty reality to swallow. Most of us see Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby and Danny Masterson getting what they deserve and think the system is really working, but those instances are exceedingly rare. Keep an eye on the Danny Masterson case and watch what his lawyers do to the victims at trial. That case has taken over a decade to get to the point of charging him - the previous detective on the case not only refused to move forward with it despite more than one victim coming forward, but ‚Äúlost‚Äù evidence. A survivor I worked with had actual phone video recordings of her partner attacking her, and it didn‚Äôt go anywhere (there‚Äôs a lot more details to that story obviously, but none of them are a good look on our legal system). It‚Äôs just heartbreak after heartbreak with this stuff. So thank you for being receptive, just know it doesn‚Äôt make me feel good to have to point this shit out because it‚Äôs not a reality I want anyone to experience."

The best video would appeal to our logic."
9680,2020-06-29 04:16:17,hh8xbg,"By that point it was already kind of too late. But each time he clarified that post, deleted his own comments, deleted the post, and then made a video on it he was giving more fuel to the fire. More screenshots being passed around, more people wondering what the deleted posts actually said, more news articles and Reddit threads, more Twitter trends and moments, more celebrity reactions. 

If you look at someone like David Dobrik, he never acknowledges any scandal at all and so they die away very quickly. After the initial accusations or call-outs are made, a story can‚Äôt continue to gain traction without a continued back-and-forth."

You know how Peter Monn has been saying that Gabbie (ugh) has said that shane told her after meeting J oh he said certain words and he wanted me to say them as well. But like Peter said if this is true then you still made two mockumentaries with him. You still gave him a bigger platform. So you can not really be against those words then.

Edit to add that i believe Shane said those words freely and lied to Gabbie to have a cover for when it came out."

9728,2020-06-29 17:39:24,hh8xbg,"Actually it's (allegedly) from a third party who knows the situation, not the actual victim. (Annndddd could be complete bullshit.)"
9729,2020-06-28 06:52:42,hh8xbg,"I know it was like...a day ago, but it‚Äôs a different time now. People have excused racism from him for YEARS, but pedophilia is a whole different ball game. (Both are fucking awful but he hasn‚Äôt been called out on the latter nearly as much.)"
9730,2020-06-28 22:50:55,hh8xbg,I seen someone called him out for having the photo in the background of one of his music videos. Clearly he didn‚Äôt mind people seeing it then..
9731,2020-06-29 00:44:44,hh8xbg,He does seem drained. I hope he spends his birthday chilling with his husband and dogs far away from all the drama (if that‚Äôs what he wants to do!)
9732,2020-06-29 00:38:45,hh8xbg,What does it mean when people say they used to be Shane fans? Like what content has he put out that people enjoyed?
9733,2020-06-29 00:40:04,hh8xbg,he probably has it on his computer so he can play it via facetime on his phone or he facetimed her through his computer and played it on his phone. he‚Äôs too smart to send it around though
9734,2020-06-29 01:21:29,hh8xbg,"She is being vague about how it went down but they were on a facetime call and I'm inclined to believe that he played it for her.

https://youtu.be/P9wlKco2YYI?t=3m20s

If he was sending the voice memo around it would eventually make it's way to the public."

9737,2020-06-29 17:16:33,hh8xbg,"I'll admit it was somewhat satisfying to watch the james charles sub count go down last year but I think that's precisely why it's so dangerous, people just love to watch someone's downfall even without knowing the full story."
9738,2020-06-29 18:06:59,hh8xbg,"I would not even look at it as a downfall. Both have made millions, and if they were smart they have enough to live off of for the rest of their lives. Id just say their time is up."
9739,2020-06-29 17:16:47,hh8xbg,How does Shane not deserve it? Of course a downfall is deserved. It‚Äôll happen. YT can‚Äôt control it.
9740,2020-06-29 17:12:28,hh8xbg,Wow. Susan in action.

9744,2020-06-28 22:26:12,hh8xbg,With all the money James has made from YT I doubt he would go with someone who is looking to build a reputation
9745,2020-06-28 21:00:09,hh8xbg,"Oh yes, even if it was just a few people complaining he still did an apology video and owned up about being wrong."
9746,2020-06-28 06:17:04,hh8xbg,Who was the woman they posted the anti Semitic drawings and caricatures about?  I can‚Äôt imagine how hurtful to her that was.
9747,2020-06-28 06:33:23,hh8xbg,"OH MY GOD thank you for posting this succinct recap of wtf 

edit: I first posted this only 5 minutes in. 

WOW"
9748,2020-06-28 06:12:41,hh8xbg,Holy Fuck. Thank you for this
9749,2020-06-28 07:04:38,hh8xbg,What...I- I wish I didn‚Äôt see this but also thankful for it? Wtf all of that is so wrong!
9750,2020-06-28 08:34:49,hh8xbg,"Wow, holy fuck that‚Äôs..... a lot. I remember watching his shanaynay vids back in the day and I cringe thinking about those, but I never saw these and I‚Äôm so so glad I didn‚Äôt. Those clips really show how his ‚Äújokes‚Äù really are a lot less jokey than he pretends they are in his apologies. I hope this video gets more attention because that was too much."
9751,2020-06-28 06:09:20,hh8xbg,Holy shit dude.
9752,2020-06-29 18:20:21,hh8xbg,"I don't know about working together but I think Blaire definitely acted as a pawn for Jumbo Shrimp. I assumed she was saying it's credible because she reached out to the alleged victim but now I realize she never even said that they spoke, just that she reached out."
9753,2020-06-29 20:44:41,hh8xbg,I don‚Äôt think Blaire is working with Jeffree because the video was her trashing him for sharing that memo as blackmail rather than respecting the wishes of that accuser
9754,2020-06-29 06:36:59,hh8xbg,Yeah they sounded annoyed that they even ‚Äúhad to‚Äù make the video. They‚Äôre not comedians so I don‚Äôt understand why they thought they may even be capable of doing something like that. Such inflated egos. I looked through the guy‚Äôs channel to see if he was funny or anything and doesn‚Äôt seem like it...

9756,2020-06-29 01:07:30,hh8xbg,just rewatched it (aka the two videos I watched over and over back in the day) and it‚Äôs still gold
9757,2020-06-29 01:15:52,hh8xbg,"Because people were just trying so hard to do the Next Viral Thing all the fucking time. It happens now and again still, especially within the beauty quarters. Latest instance is the tiny face challenge."
9758,2020-06-29 00:50:36,hh8xbg,"No who you were replying to but that time seems shallow now- I used to follow so many white teens who did Sephora hauls and tags and messy bun tutorials and honestly now I‚Äôm older if I‚Äôm taking time out of my own life to watch someone else‚Äôs I want it to be content that‚Äôs actually interesting- whether it‚Äôs more unique tutorials or hot takes and commentary or antihauls .

9770,2020-06-28 22:46:01,hh8xbg,"But who is he blackmailing with it exactly? The victim? Why?

I don't see what he has to lose if he releases it if it's legitimately incriminating for James. It would prove his point and be terrible for James, who he hates."
9771,2020-06-29 10:59:04,hh8xbg,She is trisha what do you expect haha she is disgusting
9772,2020-06-29 11:26:56,hh8xbg,I don‚Äôt know/think there could be more (wouldn‚Äôt be surprised lol) but I do think it‚Äôs wise as this gets larger and with Jeffree‚Äôs and Shane‚Äôs ‚ÄúStar power‚Äù to not say anything. Especially now that it‚Äôs being picked up by bigger news sources.
9773,2020-06-29 16:46:35,hh8xbg,I think it's safe to assume that Jizz Stain hates everyone.

9777,2020-06-29 21:27:21,hh8xbg,"To be fair I am from Liverpool so I can pick up quite a speed when talking but yeah peter monn he just seems a bit too slow for me, normally got him on 1.5 or 1.25"
9778,2020-06-29 23:58:19,hh8xbg,"Wow I was just teasing with my comment but I can‚Äôt upvote you‚Äôre comment enough. Franco always promotes shane and is completely biased understandably.

9783,2020-06-28 20:43:00,hh8xbg,Oh absolutely!
9784,2020-06-29 04:10:34,hh8xbg,I can hear the smash bros theme in the distance
9785,2020-06-28 13:01:45,hh8xbg,"For definite. She has an excellent support system though, that will help her as she heals.

Shane is disgusting. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if people came forward with allegations, there are so many warning signs coming from him"

9788,2020-06-29 10:28:54,hh8xbg,And Peter Monn said she has info from Jeffree which she is conveniently very quiet now.
9789,2020-06-29 10:25:48,hh8xbg,Ugh it‚Äôs sad. She needs to seriously get offline to just decompress. I don‚Äôt understand why her boyfriend and friends are supporting this behavior in her live streams. It‚Äôs just not healthy to fixate on it this much
9790,2020-06-29 14:00:10,hh8xbg,"I don‚Äôt really buy that (if it‚Äôs a lie then it‚Äôs a lie, Jeffree has mentioned the memo enough that setting the record straight would ‚Äúexpose‚Äù him once and for all) but tbh I‚Äôm not thinking about this from James‚Äô perspective, but instead from the alleged victim‚Äôs. If the whole internet was speculating whether I was a sexual abuse victim when I wasn‚Äôt, at some point I would say enough is enough, please put this energy towards holding actual abusers and predators accountable."
9791,2020-06-28 10:13:34,hh8xbg,"It‚Äôs a shame that she was the one to receive backlash about it, she‚Äôs guilty for participating but she‚Äôs also a victim since she was exploited by him."

9793,2020-06-29 09:36:50,hh8xbg,I 100% believe that \*at most\* there is a voice memo from one of the twins being annoyed by JC and with Jeffree manipulating the conversation
9794,2020-06-28 11:23:00,hh8xbg,"Ryland yes, Morgan no. I think Morgan will stay in Colorado and make videos with her friend instead and I think people like those videos cause they have so much chemistry together and are pretty funny"
9795,2020-06-28 11:07:34,hh8xbg,I don‚Äôt think so
9796,2020-06-28 12:06:42,hh8xbg,It's not his channel. It's a fan account to archive his videos. He's already bad enough haha no need to give out false information. (not saying you're doing that on purpose!!!!)
9797,2020-06-28 17:36:59,hh8xbg,"It seems ballsy (not really the right word) of James to show that text if he truly did that. I‚Äôm not saying it didn‚Äôt happen, it just seems strange."
9798,2020-06-28 17:32:57,hh8xbg,"It‚Äôs disgusting how he‚Äôs treating it like gossip..

‚Äúomg guys I heard Grayson was molested by James. And I oop-!‚Äù"
9799,2020-06-28 17:30:35,hh8xbg,To which James spoke with the Dolan twins and they said they hadn‚Äôt spoke to him. Until one of the Dolan twins actually says something don‚Äôt spread more misinformation.

9805,2020-06-29 02:07:32,hh8xbg,"She jumped on camera without thinking about what she was saying and she was right in a way and if it had been the second video she put out it would've been one thing but the way she jumped on the hype and the language she used came off so so so selfish to me. But I do agree with you about how shitty Shane's video was.

Re: having friends with different views, nah, I don't accept that, I don't agree with the idea that transphobia, racism, homophobia, any of that are views or opinions that can be disagreed upon. You have to be anti racism, anti homophobia, anti hate. Silence is violence."

9811,2020-06-28 13:28:29,hh8xbg,"I find it unfair how people degrade Ryland as a gold digger. Esp when he had a career before Shane and bought the G wagon with his own money. He gets enough views and sponsorships to sustain himself. 

He is also the one actually interested in makeup, did Shane's beauty room and watch beauty gurus. Makeup was Ryland's thing and Shane would often be embarased every time he is in drag. Yet his input was cast aside in the docu series."

9815,2020-06-29 19:56:23,hh8xbg,"There is a clear fear of negative criticism on his part.  But has it been used as just a tactic to garner sympathy and reassurance?  Probably.  I can't imagine what being judged by 20M people would be like...but then again, it was a choice."

He kept looking around and checking and lowering his voice because he KNEW what he was doing was not okay and was borderline grooming behaviour. Then there's the rest of the videos..."
9825,2020-06-30 02:30:49,hh8xbg,"I agree. I think he wants zero part in this whether it's good attention or not. I know I would be embarrassed if I had a high profile ""friend"" in the news like this."

9833,2020-06-28 15:30:15,hh8xbg,"I‚Äôve watched her since the beginning and I LOVED her historical looks videos. So creative, thoughtful and well made.

But now she just does the same ‚ÄúI Tried x Service‚Äù or ‚ÄúFrankenmakeup‚Äù videos. Most of her videos have been the exact same formula for over a year now, which imo shows a huge lack of inspiration.

She was far more creative on Buzzfeed and in the early days of her channel."
9834,2020-06-28 15:51:05,hh8xbg,"I'm mostly let down about her not saying anything about rob, then again I'm sure she sent them a DM. Shane I'd really just consider a work friend."
9835,2020-06-28 15:26:57,hh8xbg,"Her apology video? Yup. I wish she‚Äôd addressed the shane/j* situation, especially since she always spoke so highly of Shane but I also understand it was her video about her content."

9852,2020-06-29 13:04:26,hh8xbg,"This is one of the biggest mysteries of all in this circus lmao. Did Shame just ignore the PR person and post his 4 Page Letter, but then did he let the PR team help with his video?

Or, maybe Sham doesn't think he needs a PR team because he's always right (sarcasm), doesn't want anything that would tar his manipulated sensitive/genuine persona and he also has Recreant Adams' help."
9853,2020-06-29 13:25:01,hh8xbg,"His last words, ‚ÄúWhat the fuck Jeffree?‚Äù"
9854,2020-06-29 13:20:17,hh8xbg,Honestly the smartest thing JC has done is not say anything during all of this. It's driving Shane and Jermaine Salamander crazy (you know it is) that he hasn't said or even acknowledged anything they're doing. At this point JC has liable slander as a viable lawsuit he could file against them.
9855,2020-06-29 14:52:29,hh8xbg,"I mean, he‚Äôs LITERALLY family to her. I heard somewhere that they are second cousins. Yikes."
9856,2020-06-29 15:14:15,hh8xbg,"Oh, sorry. I've no idea, I haven't heard anything of the sort. I think considering how big this sub is, someone already would have mentioned it."

9861,2020-06-28 19:53:36,hh8xbg,"I think it‚Äôs bc of the connection to dramagedon? Even though withholding a Voice Memo containing an apparent victim of Sexual Assault for ‚Äúblackmail‚Äù makes J* look fucking psychotic, or also deflects the attention away  from him and Shame  back to Charles"
9862,2020-06-28 19:53:37,hh8xbg,"It ""helps him"" because it gives validity to the voice memo claim. 
The only negative thing she said about him we already knew for a LONG time, like him having dirt on other YouTubers. It's something he said himself.
It also helps him because it diverts attention away from his business partner, Shane."

9875,2020-06-29 01:28:05,hh8xbg,I didn't listen the podcast but I'm sadly familiar with Blaire's opinions so I guess it was more related to how *transgere-ism* was cataloged as a mental illiness instead of the particular experiences of trans peolpe. She is transphobic despite being trans herself.
9876,2020-06-29 07:58:52,hh8xbg,"I'm really not seeing him. I am seeing that he is still following jeffree üôÑ. Also following Barbara Streisand, which I love."

He's disgusting."
9882,2020-06-28 17:37:41,hh8xbg,Right but we knew that already because he‚Äôs talked about this voice memo many times. Either that or none of it‚Äôs true and this is all deflection.
9883,2020-06-28 17:45:20,hh8xbg,"Except that wasn't new information. We heard it from the horse's mouth, J\* admits to having dirt on people. I can see how Blaire White, who despite her putting that clip from 2019 of her questioning the existence of the voice memo in the video, said earlier this year with the whole Dahvie sh\*t that she is a huge fan of his. I can see her putting this video to ignite hate against JC by flaming validity to J\*'s ""receipt"" against James."
9884,2020-06-28 17:32:35,hh8xbg,"We‚Äôve always known that. Like she pointed out, jeffree has even said it publicly. So that‚Äôs not dirt."

9949,2020-06-28 06:02:01,hh8xbg,I was thinking what if J* is behind the resurfacing of these clips of Shane's..
9950,2020-06-28 15:07:43,hh8xbg,Maybe scare tactics? She claims Jeff has receipts that he refuses to drop. I don‚Äôt think he has anything but who knows. But I‚Äôll definitely be here to see if anything does drop. üëÄ
9951,2020-06-29 15:37:06,hh8xbg,Nick also left a comment on an IG post stating that the person in the voicemail was outed by James when he read jeff‚Äôs Text message in his ‚Äúno more lies‚Äù video
9952,2020-06-29 16:28:28,hh8xbg,"Lmao I watched that video in full twice. It was her payroll video. 

She said jeffree told her about the note and she assumed Tati had heard the note. There is no confirmation that Tati has heard the note. Period."
9953,2020-06-29 14:29:32,hh8xbg,Yes! Also we‚Äôve seen how impressionable she is with her 5G conspiracy and amethyst crystal magic. She can be too trusting of people and her friends opinions.
9954,2020-06-28 12:11:39,hh8xbg,At least he's been mostly exiled to OnlyFans and lost his patreon. Small victories üôÉ
9955,2020-06-28 13:13:17,hh8xbg,"Ah got it. Sounds like Shane's not Onision levels of grooming young children, but he certainly doesn't seem to understand where the boundary lines are."
9956,2020-06-28 19:03:18,hh8xbg,"How is her reaching out and offering support to both alleged victims a contradiction to her only having one voice memo? She was offering support and letting the person know that Jeffree is telling people a story about them. You don't need proof to reach out, in fact it's pretty normal behaviour to want to make sure someone is okay if you hear something terrible may have happened to them. 

Also it's not weird that she didn't out both names, one was already public knowledge and the other isn't, and outing the rapist could out the victim. Whereas with JC, she just verified that the voice memo was real and she found it to be condemning, so the information couldn't lead to implications about the victim that didn't exist before"
9957,2020-06-28 18:52:39,hh8xbg,I thought she just reached out to JC‚Äôs alleged victim?
9958,2020-06-28 19:05:04,hh8xbg,"A lot of people seem to be criticizing the video, actually-at least from my Twitter feed."
9959,2020-06-28 19:08:08,hh8xbg,"I had no clue who she was until this situation started. Who knows what to believe in general anymore? I think even just the *hint* of there being any actual truth to JC sexually assaulting someone is going to set the Internet off.  JC is gonna have to address it again. Jabber Slug will find a way to crawl out unscathed like he always does, but I see people on Twitter acknowledging that he withheld potential evidence and used it as blackmail."
9960,2020-06-28 19:21:24,hh8xbg,"But Jeffree said the EXACT same thing last year. Then he got cocky on Instagram stories and said he was gonna post all of the receipts. 

What happened? He chickened out and made his ""final apology video"" and tried to act like he was above it all for not posting his alleged receipts. 

He also swore he wouldn't get into any drama but HERE WE ARE. Like y'all need to see that Jeffree is playing your mind like a fiddle. *there is no spoon*"
9961,2020-06-28 21:41:16,hh8xbg,"I didn't say anything about James, just that multiple people have now come out showing what Jeffree is doing behind the scenes."
9962,2020-06-29 13:24:38,hh8xbg,Ok thanks.
9963,2020-06-28 18:57:22,hh8xbg,"> It just confirms the existence of some type of receipt 

Uh. No, it doesn't."
9964,2020-06-29 17:30:46,hh8xbg,"Not make a video further exploiting the situation. Privately reaching out to the victim is one thing, but then hyping up an expose video for days and then speaking on the matter for the views is gross.

Edit: to be clear, I don't think messaging the victim is a good idea either but jfc do it in private if you must."
9965,2020-06-29 17:34:59,hh8xbg,"She could have just not released the video, kind of like she was content doing before J* didn't stick up for Shane and she got pissy. That's what she could have done. 

She could have *not* made a video reiterating the same rumors that have been around for a year and put herself in a position where she felt the best course of action was to message the survivor. 

>If jeffree star was using my voice recording talking about my assault to blackmail people then I would want to know about it.

You really think they don't? After J* literally said as much on Keemstar and has been steady hinting at this shit since last year? 

Blaire isn't some hero who was acting in the best interests of the alleged SA victim. All she did was set their trauma up to be consumed as tea against JC, despite her claims to the contrary, and it was 100% unnecessary. 

She was fine sitting on that information until it served her purposes to ""leak"" it and she should have just sat on it instead of making it easier to specify the victim by specifying their occupation."
9966,2020-06-28 08:17:29,hh8xbg,Oop sorry! I have no idea about the main channel
9967,2020-06-28 08:58:18,hh8xbg,"But as late as 2016 he was doing edgelord humour on his podcast, such as the comparing paedophilia to a foot fetish and saying a 6 year old was sexy."
9968,2020-06-28 13:07:29,hh8xbg,"Found a different upload of the video, it should work now."
9969,2020-06-29 21:06:22,hh8xbg,ofc they do ü§™ he's the poor king and so obviously has brand deals where commoners like is shop /s
9970,2020-06-29 01:25:51,hh8xbg,"I don't think James will respond unless something requires him too. Everything that ""came out"" today was just a rehashing of things he already addressed last year."
9971,2020-06-29 02:06:11,hh8xbg,"Maybe character growth in this case is... like, keeping his drama private. Not everything has to be a public spectacle. J\* and Shane don't get that, so they keep trying to make everything as public as possible."
9972,2020-06-29 01:40:07,hh8xbg,"He has the right to, but he shouldn‚Äôt, because he would look guilty as hell"
9973,2020-06-29 01:45:59,hh8xbg,"Why are people here assuming that the recording is false? It seems very disrespectful to immediately assume someone is lying without hearing it.

Whoever it is needs to come forward with their own story and if they do I hope they aren't immediately dismissed just because public opinion is favouring James right now. You can't pick and choose what victims to believe depending on how much you like the creator."
9974,2020-06-29 10:30:11,hh8xbg,"Update: took a closer look and I think she's just dissecting his ""I'm leaving the beauty community"" announcement in the vid but I bet she'll follow up with another."

9997,2020-06-28 20:12:36,hh8xbg,"I‚Äôd disagree. J* is back in the conversation again. Right now people are giving JC the benefit of the doubt and questioning the authenticity of the memo because absolutely no evidence has been produced. The burden of proof is on J* and right now the last thing he wants is attention since people are finding out about his past and his associations w revenge porn+child molesters.

Edit: I‚Äôd also add that it just makes J* look bad either way. If the memo IS real, he‚Äôs trash for using it. If it‚Äôs fake, then that‚Äôs even worse."
9998,2020-06-28 10:35:51,hh8xbg,Yes if he was working in traditional media and made these ‚Äújokes‚Äù he would be be blacklisted and never work again. He wants to advocate for YouTube creators being equal to traditional media stars but can‚Äôt hold himself accountable for his behavior. Independent creators need to be able to publish media that is not offensive if they want to have a platform that is respected.

10017,2020-06-28 21:18:14,hh8xbg,"That's always the case with her. I'm over her tbh. She is rude af to her own subscribers and then she wonders why she isn't getting the views on her videos. Even her antihauls are doing poorly compared to a few months ago.

I'm not sad for her. She has a regular fulltime job outside YT and won't have issues surviving without YouTube."
10018,2020-06-28 16:42:48,hh8xbg,"Not trying to defend the actions - but they don't amount to pedophilia. 

Child porn isn't googling ""naked baby"". It's much more serious than that.

Pedophilia isn't pretending to jerk off as a joke, nor is it saying weird shit to your cousin - as a joke or not (and intent matters here).

Pedophilia is grooming and having sex with minors. It is a serious thing to say, and his content is shit and inappropriate, but it isn't that."

10022,2020-06-28 21:25:22,hh8xbg,Props for the Jeff Dunham reference
10023,2020-06-28 21:49:49,hh8xbg,I've been thinking this the whole time. What if its j* trying to deflect attention off him. I wouldn't put it past him to be honest.
10024,2020-06-28 22:39:25,hh8xbg,"Well Ashley said it first, to me Blaire was confirming what Ashley has said not the other way round. Ashley shows text messages from Jeffree where he pretty much insinuated the same thing. Although no one has the memo but him, he just plays it for people apparently, not sending it."
10025,2020-06-29 02:23:04,hh8xbg,Not in the eyes of the public though

10027,2020-06-30 00:02:09,hh8xbg,and she gave shane SO much leeway for a few weeks because she was a fan of his and had talked with him personally. I'm not blaming her for having to face all of this which is just... some massive cognitive dissonance. But you need to realize that you're coming from that perspective and possibly remove yourself from explaining the narrative if you think you'll be swayed one way or the other.
10028,2020-06-30 00:00:35,hh8xbg,"Yeah, the issue is no one is confirming they heard it. If we want to show that Jeffree is actually scum for spreading a victims story around and weaponizing it-- we need people to come forward and say they have heard it. They don't need to list the contents, mention the victims or even mention the alleged predators. Just ""Jeffree Star shared the voice memo to me when it wasn't his place to do it""

&#x200B;

If they all stay quiet and make it this open secret, it doesn't... do anything. We need more people sharing what jeffree has done or he's gonna keep chugging on like a cockroach.

&#x200B;

And yeah, the people who have spoken on the voice note that I've seen? None have heard it. Not the tea channels, not the commentary channels, I haven't seen any other influencer say they heard it. Just that they know it exists and MAYBE someone heard it."
10029,2020-06-30 03:56:35,hh8xbg,"Yes! I feel like I'm a broken record about this at this point, but it needs to be said: Homophobia was a HUGE factor in Dramagedon 2. It was one of the driving strenghts behind it. I'm so irked by how this isn't something more people talk about."
10030,2020-06-28 22:31:15,hh8xbg,People really discount her but when it comes to calling out other people‚Äôs theatrics she‚Äôs pretty spot on. I‚Äôve agreed with everything she‚Äôs said about Gabbie.

10033,2020-06-29 15:52:17,hh8xbg,"It really is. Wonder what the motivation for that is? To be honest, I could see Jeffree stop drinking because he doesn‚Äôt want to lose control- because this is just one big strategy game for him. Maybe he says that because he thinks reality is whatever he makes it lol"
10034,2020-06-30 00:05:08,hh8xbg,A known groomer.
10035,2020-06-28 13:18:47,hh8xbg,"They had Tati appear on one of their videos a few days before Bye Sister dropped. Aside from Ben being kinda inappropriate, he kept hinting at a video that was coming and wanting her to talk about it. 

While they might have not know the exact content of the video, I think Ben kept hinting that it was big. Given Ben's hate boner for James Charles, the timing of everything was just a little too convenient"

10044,2020-06-29 04:11:21,hh8xbg,that's their problem tbh. none of this would've happened if shane acted like a decent person.
10045,2020-06-29 04:17:17,hh8xbg,"Shane is responsible for his own actions. Don‚Äôt try and shift the focus of the blame to his mom being a bad influence. 

And honestly? They‚Äôre all adults. This was all public info, people aren‚Äôt digging this up from some secret archive or making false accusations or saying they HEARD something happened. This is all things Shane our out in the world, and then he published these huge videos on YouTube about the big names, stuck drama into his trailer to get those clips, and made millions of dollars off his fans and never did a single make up look. 

He is an adult and he is facing the consequences of his own actions. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs mentally hard for him because none of us want to face this kind of scrutiny, but he put his name and face out there and repeatedly has stated he wants to make movies. He let his name and his face and his brand be associated with all the things he did previously and only apologized when he came under fire. 

This is tough, surely. But he‚Äôs an adult man and he needs to handle his business. That‚Äôs all there is to it"

10047,2020-06-28 23:07:44,hh8xbg,He got removed from his own company... allegedly said the N word in a board meeting.
10048,2020-06-28 23:06:10,hh8xbg,"He said the n-word in a conference call (in a diversity training call on top of it), and the company made him resign as CEO."
10049,2020-06-28 23:06:47,hh8xbg,Papa John himself said the n-word and got ousted from the company.
10050,2020-06-28 23:05:15,hh8xbg,Papa John (The founder) got kicked out of his company by the board because of a recording of him saying racial slurs. He‚Äôs no longer in the company or whole branding but they kept the name.
10051,2020-06-28 22:59:13,hh8xbg,"Yeah you are right, we only know what he has told us so I won't take it as facts."
10052,2020-06-29 00:39:29,hh8xbg,"Fake it until you make it. 

Dude‚Äôs got money, but how much more has he become worth since Shane‚Äôs first series. 

During the MySpace days he was a complete joke, he was ‚Äúfamous for being famous‚Äù he was known for having photoshoots. All the MySpace stuff is lost to time now, but his music career didn‚Äôt even come until everyone had stopped using MySpace. 

It‚Äôs like some alternative history propaganda when he says he‚Äôs known for the music. Most of the stuff people actually said about him is long gone."
10053,2020-06-29 02:32:49,hh8xbg,:) exactly. I was being sarcastic. He‚Äôs obviously not reputable.
10054,2020-06-29 14:44:42,hh8xbg,God I hope she doesn't announce an album. It will be so cringe.
10055,2020-06-29 17:09:30,hh8xbg,"Nothing yet.... It doesn't rule out a video completely, but she used to post right at 1:00 p.m. EST, right?"
10056,2020-06-28 18:50:54,hh8xbg,"Exactly, you know if it existed he would be sending it to every journalist, drama channel and police force he could find"
10057,2020-06-29 03:03:47,hh8xbg,No he just deleted a bunch of videos
10058,2020-06-30 04:03:36,hh8xbg,"He really needed one after everything that happened last year. And like-- he's still done some stupid things, but he has not gotten into nearly as much trouble as he did in 2019.

&#x200B;

then again coachella was cancelled so he had not chance to have his butt cheeks hanging out."
10059,2020-06-28 15:32:15,hh8xbg,Can't blame J* for the past. Doesn't mean she can't try and turn the tide back towards Jafar tho. I think it's too late though.
10060,2020-06-28 17:00:37,hh8xbg,I mean his Willow Smith video is arguably child p\*rn....
10061,2020-06-28 23:08:25,hh8xbg,"It's all good. I wasn't sure if you were serious or not about just getting rid of it, and I understand the motivation, but if you already have it, mght as well just use it and dispose of it when it's used up (you and anyone else in a similar situation reading this).  

Then when you need to repurchase, take a gander somewhere else less problematic. 

I certainly wasn't trying to sound like I was judging you. Stay safe! ‚ò∫Ô∏è"

10067,2020-06-28 23:19:10,hh8xbg,"i think the screenshot you‚Äôre talking about is from him deleting videos off of his other channel, ShaneDawsonTV. he deleted all the videos from that channel except for 2."
10068,2020-06-28 23:11:17,hh8xbg,looks like he deleted it now so hopefully someone called him out and he checks this shit in the future or people unfollow
10069,2020-06-28 17:31:01,hh8xbg,"She's a Conservative political commentator, and I know the beauty community in general skews pretty Left/Progressive, so it's not a surprise she's considered very problematic in these circles, but she's kind of turned her channel into talking about predators and advocating for victims and, IMO, it doesn't matter what her political stances are- that's a good thing to do no matter what."
10070,2020-06-28 17:30:07,hh8xbg,"She's problematic to say the least. She's toned down her content a lot over the years, but the stuff she does right now can definitely be called transphobic (she is trans herself if you didn't know)."
10071,2020-06-28 17:28:37,hh8xbg,Yes people are just sensitive and hate seeing a free-thinking trans woman be successful. They think all trans people need to have the same ideology and views on trans issues or else they‚Äôre a bootlicker/bad person. I‚Äôm somewhat good friends with Blaire (through DMs and texts) and she is the sweetest.

10077,2020-06-28 17:12:40,hh8xbg,She‚Äôs a trumpeter who loves attacking other trans women.

10079,2020-06-29 12:30:24,hh8xbg,"You keep saying it was a tell all but she literally just rehashed old shit everyone already knew about. This is not new news. She mentioned multiple times she‚Äôs bringing it as to not be complicit. She‚Äôs also denounced Shane and spoke (to what seemed pretty genuine but know who‚Äôs) about it on her Instagram story and said she‚Äôs making a separate video on it. Blaire is problematic at the very fucking least, but one thing she‚Äôs also been very consistent on is her stance on sexual assault/ sexual predators."

10084,2020-06-28 19:03:37,hh8xbg,"I agree, 100%. I think James is innocent, personally - I'm sure he has heard of those ""receipts"" that Jabberwocky is always flaunting about and he has never shown himself daunted by it. 

Wasn't it also rumored by someone that there were also recordings of Jebbediah in James' possession?"
10085,2020-06-29 11:59:32,hh8xbg,"Unfortunately there is no black and white when it comes to topics like this. Each person will handle it differently based on what they went through and how they were raised. She didn‚Äôt expose them which is the most important thing imo. Also she didn‚Äôt monetize this, so she‚Äôs not earning cash for this. Maybe views and potential subscribers, but in the grand scheme of things she has much more risk to lose than win in this situation."
10086,2020-06-29 12:41:56,hh8xbg,Did you even watch the video? So much of it was Blaire being upset that J* wields the memo as if it were interesting tea and Blaire keeps mentioning that all of this is extremely serious and not just fun drama.

10089,2020-06-28 11:15:55,hh8xbg,"But then I could say that Ryland, Morgan, Andrew (and others) probably don‚Äôt know all the ins and outs of Shane‚Äôs past as well. More and more new videos keep coming out that I‚Äôve never seen before and I doubt they will have either."

10091,2020-06-28 17:38:48,hh8xbg,"It‚Äôs not huge when you don‚Äôt show the supposed ‚Äúreceipts.‚Äù I understand not wanting to out the victim, but she shouldn‚Äôt come out and say anything if she doesn‚Äôt back those claims up by making the proof public.

I can understand that she‚Äôs between a rock and a hard place with the situation, but even mentioning that the alleged victim is a big YouTuber is pretty much outing who it is to begin with since J* claimed Grayson Dolan was molested by JC. And people are going to speculate even more now that it‚Äôs Grayson Dolan, so you might as well just release the fucking receipts.

Totally want everyone to be held accountable for their actions, including JC, but this ‚ÄúI have receipts but I‚Äôm not gonna show them, yet still heavily imply who did what and to who‚Äù bullshit is just a game."
10092,2020-06-28 17:34:08,hh8xbg,"She said they are credible. But where they at tho? We‚Äôre just suppose to believe her? I just find it so ironic she bitched about him at length not showing receipts, and forcing himself into the drama and then she‚Äôs doing the exact same thing. This ain‚Äôt it sis."
10093,2020-06-28 17:45:33,hh8xbg,"Yeah but who is she to say that? There were a lot of claims last year that got squashed by the only one to actually show receipts, JC."
10094,2020-06-28 17:37:25,hh8xbg,"True, I feel how the alleged victim unfollowed James during D2 and started making vids with j* it was highly likely to be true anyway, i think everyone may possibly go after James again now (not saying he doesn't deserve it if the allegations are true) but it deflects from Jeff's behaviour again because he was telling the truth, I get the feeling jeffree may have hoped she dropped actual receipts to prove him right"
10095,2020-06-28 18:52:58,hh8xbg,They have nothing better to do than attack her when all she wants to do is help others. It‚Äôs fucking sick twisted mob mentality.
10096,2020-06-29 16:43:27,hh8xbg,"I hadn‚Äôt thought of that, i dont follow the, so i didnt know about their dad. Thank you"
10097,2020-06-29 17:58:05,hh8xbg,Plus James was the one if I remember correctly that publicly dragged them in to it
10098,2020-06-29 16:18:20,hh8xbg,Oh. I wouldn‚Äôt really say they have the power to end someone‚Äôs career then
10099,2020-06-29 16:25:18,hh8xbg,We can‚Äôt speculate on who the person is. Pinned comment
10100,2020-06-29 17:55:48,hh8xbg,Yeah I listened to one and people can get a shout out on the podcast if they tweet about it

10102,2020-06-29 06:39:03,hh8xbg,"My mistake, it didn‚Äôt read that way. I don‚Äôt think Garrett‚Äôs the type to involve himself by choice tbh"
10103,2020-06-29 18:46:59,hh8xbg,I agree that she believes it doesn‚Äôt make it true. But her not even slightly doubting it might have given it some extra credit because it seems to be convincing
10104,2020-06-28 19:02:07,hh8xbg,"Why are we criticising her video instead of focusing on SD, a racist and maybe paedophile, and J* who will not hesitate to use someone's rape for gossip and drama"
10105,2020-06-29 16:56:57,hh8xbg,"Ramsey is the worst person on the show (imo) but James isn‚Äôt the worst in this scenario... by a mile. I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs a Sansa, did some questionable things to get ahead and climb the ladder when he was young, but has paid for it tremendously and has hopefully grown from it."
10106,2020-06-29 18:47:35,hh8xbg,Haha thanks! Now to figure out who John snow is so we can kill him off before he destroys Michelle phan.
10107,2020-06-29 18:37:43,hh8xbg,I mean Jaime yeeted a child out of a window lmfao
10108,2020-06-29 18:44:15,hh8xbg,"Jamie pushed Bran a boy of 8? Off a tower, killed Jory, and his own cousin to take his place. Then raped his own sister in front of her dead child's grave...

After he committed all those crimes he continued to commit more just like Shane. But they both regretted it in the end, like Shane is now.

Neither of them did it for power like Cersei or clout like Pycel or money. They did it for love/family i.e Cersei(js) ."
10109,2020-06-28 21:52:44,hh8xbg,Thats kinda what i figured/meant but to stress the part that they started way back when and continued to profit off of it. Its just all really gross ü§Æ
10110,2020-06-30 02:33:32,hh8xbg,"Yeah. Exactly. Jeffree planted all these seeds so people would want to put it together and feel like detectives. So if this isn‚Äôt true? It doesn‚Äôt matter because you feel like you finished a puzzle. Like you‚Äôve accomplished something. 

I wish people would slow down when they hear about the voice memo and just question a few simple things around it."
10111,2020-06-30 02:49:49,hh8xbg,"Blaire said J\* played the audio for her and she thought it was ""credible""... but that's pretty much all she could say on both subjects. She didn't mention how or why she felt they were credible. She mentioned reaching out to a victim (Which I think is way over stepping boundaries and so violating fyi) to express that she was a SA survivor as well, but she didn't mention any interaction beyond that."
10112,2020-06-30 02:58:02,hh8xbg,They have not. Keem Star went on record saying they haven‚Äôt. Jeffree offered on air and then apparently later said it wasn‚Äôt his place to share it. I‚Äôd dig up the tweet but that means going through keem stars twitter
10113,2020-06-29 08:30:49,hh8xbg,Neither have I. Peter Monn's vid talked about it.
10114,2020-06-29 12:09:52,hh8xbg,Yeah it‚Äôs like having a phone all that you can‚Äôt respond to it‚Äôs weird as heck
10115,2020-06-29 14:11:11,hh8xbg,"Same. And I dunno maybe I'm biased but that video was so full of agenda. And I srsly don't buy this ""oh I'm afraid of jeffree but I have to do what's right"" like sis, you wanna help out a friend and you couldn't give a damn about jeffree, and that act is jsut to make you more relatable. Like we can see thru it."
10116,2020-06-29 11:26:04,hh8xbg,That first 10s... Wow.

10119,2020-06-29 09:37:56,hh8xbg,"She‚Äôs been tweeting lately about how she‚Äôs been shadowbanned (she hasn‚Äôt), and how YouTube is suppressing her video (probably not true). Considering she‚Äôs got anxiety, I think she‚Äôs not well at the moment."
10120,2020-06-29 09:35:46,hh8xbg,"Yes, she‚Äôs been claiming to have been shadowbanned by YouTube. Drama channels messaged her and explained that she hasn‚Äôt been shadowbanned and gave evidence. She was having none of it and still believes she‚Äôs been shadowbanned. She also thinks that YouTube are suppressing her video, which could be true, but she only thinks this because she thinks her view/interaction ratio is too *high*."
10121,2020-06-29 09:27:24,hh8xbg,"On a serious note, Theres a clip where she is calling herself a victim and I dont know how to feel about it. well I laughed but still."
10122,2020-06-29 09:21:08,hh8xbg,She‚Äôs really going through something then

10124,2020-06-29 09:42:53,hh8xbg,"What I don't get is: if this is serious and she thinks she's being stalked, what's the point of writing on twitter that if something happens it's not an accident? Wtf i hope she at least went to the police"

10138,2020-06-28 17:47:55,hh8xbg,She teased it so much as this thing that would clear up Shane's involvement and prove that J\* is a monster...while providing no new info. We already knew from J\*'s own mouth that he keeps 'dirt' on people. This is her just coming to say the dirt is real ya'll.

10144,2020-06-28 17:38:33,hh8xbg,Ok.
10145,2020-06-28 18:44:32,hh8xbg,"What is she going to say that she didn‚Äôt already say in Bye Sister though? She won‚Äôt and shouldn‚Äôt out the victim, and the information on the act is out there now. It‚Äôs not a leap to figure out that she knows this information and alluded to it in that video. I‚Äôm not being argumentative btw, I‚Äôm genuinely looking at this from both perspectives and want to spark a conversation about it. Of course I would love to see her speak about it, but it will do her absolutely no good for her and it wouldn‚Äôt even serve to change her stance, since she already referenced accusations. 

I think that lawyers definitely got involved last year, somehow. I think that‚Äôs a big reason why she won‚Äôt speak on it further. What confuses me is if lawyers did get involved, why is Jafar still running around telling people about it? It made sense to me that lawyers got involved after J* made his nakedly transparent ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not engaging in drama anymore‚Äù video, but isn‚Äôt it just a bad to continue spreading this around? It‚Äôs all just so convoluted and fucked up."
10146,2020-06-28 19:20:52,hh8xbg,Pretty much. Take everything with a pinch of salt

10152,2020-06-28 22:52:25,hh8xbg,"The people that are involved and posting on twitter and reddit are not really representative of everyone who watched the video, I‚Äôm sure plenty of people left Blaire‚Äôs video thinking ‚Äúomg so James was a predator!‚Äù. I think it‚Äôs too early to know if Blaire and J* worked on this video together, but if they did- yeah he didn‚Äôt think it through."
10153,2020-06-29 02:24:04,hh8xbg,"The heat wasn‚Äôt really on him at the moment, though.  It was all focused on Shane instead.  I just don‚Äôt think J* convinced Blair to do this."
10154,2020-06-28 08:43:13,hh8xbg,"Yeah, I don‚Äôt think they are bad people. They just give me the same vibe as white kids that go to mission trips and say shit like ‚Äúoh I learned so much, people are suffering, we should do better‚Äù and then go back to the suburbs to live cushy lives. 

Like, they may have good intentions and a good heart, and like everyone they must have their own struggles, but they have the life experience or social awareness of a tea spoon. 

People know racism is bad. As a concept. But you only really know how bad it is when you‚Äôve lived through it or at least close to it.  That‚Äôs why you get so many people making ‚Äúedgy jokes‚Äù about race, rape, or stuff like that."

10158,2020-06-28 08:05:18,hh8xbg,"I hate to break it to you, but literally all of his videos were filled with vile things on par with anything being dragged up right now.

Psych IRL made a video in April about ""What Happened to Garrett Watts"" and it just hit me that Shane featured all these people on his channel because having a squad was the prevailing trend on YouTube.  For some reason that actually never occurred to me, I guess because I don't watch other ""squad"" oriented YouTubers.  And now it makes more sense why he ditched them all for Jeffree Star.  Because it was always about image and dollar signs."
10166,2020-06-28 07:04:09,hh8xbg,Omg his and Garrett‚Äôs company! Wasn‚Äôt it supposed to be worked on in the apartment they forced Morgan to live in for awhile üíÄ
10167,2020-06-28 16:04:01,hh8xbg,Wow. All that appears to be long after I stopped watching Bobby Burns' videos (around 2016). This is like a whole different world for me. I didn't even know he had long hair now.
10168,2020-06-28 16:02:29,hh8xbg,I only knew him from his movie reviews back in 2016. I dropped him like a hot potato when he started saying weird sexist things. I had no idea he's a big youtuber/musician now???

You don't have to say 'I believe the unknown victim!' or whatever to simply acknowledge that this would be INCREDIBLY shitty and also something that I could see J* doing in a heartbeat. People saying that this does nothing to him are kind of losing sight of things a bit imo."
10173,2020-06-28 19:16:34,hh8xbg,There's no proof so people aren't really assuming anything as far as I can see.
10174,2020-06-28 15:04:18,hh8xbg,Oh yeah. That's why people find it weird that she decided to somewhat insert herself into Karmageddon. She didn't have to cancel herself. A lovely bye YouTube video at some other time would have worked and you won't have people getting mad at those rightfully asking for accountability among YouTubers. She just looked so defeated in her last video so there must have been a lot of things going on in her head that led to it.
10175,2020-06-29 18:43:38,hh8xbg,It was. But people were digging and saving evidence since he posted that stupid tweet
10176,2020-06-28 12:26:24,hh8xbg,Yeah the dm's are where people really lash out. Also I've seen fbe/finebros and Trisha getting dragged all over Twitter. I think people are looking. Bored people should look over social blades for view deletes so we know who's feeling heat lol
10177,2020-06-29 09:30:08,hh8xbg,"OMG YES I remember that. He literally brushed over that and then when Jake mentioned his brother\[Logan\] sleeping with a girl he liked, he was practically at tears and like ""oH mY GoD hOw CoUlD hE?!"" like uh - where are the priorities?!!?

10178,2020-06-28 12:28:12,hh8xbg,"Was Bart not already cancelled? I could have sworn he was, or did he just become not relevant anymore?"
10179,2020-06-28 12:42:19,hh8xbg,"I don't think the Troye Situation is relevant. Since it was an accident. I don't know, Jenna has done some questionable things recently. As has Pewdiepie.
Also, Smosh no longer exists as it once was so I think it's different? I don't know."
10180,2020-06-28 13:02:59,hh8xbg,If anyone has changed as a person in the last 10 years it‚Äôs Jenna. It doesn‚Äôt seem like she‚Äôs putting her heart in her content anymore (which is fine it‚Äôs literally been 10 years and she‚Äôs a grown woman with other responsibilities) and used this as a jumping point to take a break
10181,2020-06-28 13:08:38,hh8xbg,I didn‚Äôt see any direct comments made about Jennas past videos. I know she did a reaction video a while back watching old content and was really embarrassed by how she acted. Some people gave her crap for endorsing the collab on her channel though
10182,2020-06-28 12:25:39,hh8xbg,Isn‚Äôt Smosh dead? Or is that channel still a thing?
10183,2020-06-28 12:39:55,hh8xbg,Jenna was most likely targeted (if she was at all) because she promoted J*'s Cremated Pallette and is friends with Shane.
10184,2020-06-29 04:21:11,hh8xbg,She criticized Shane for being racist and his stans kept harassing her. This was several years ago.
10185,2020-06-28 22:49:24,hh8xbg,"Agreed, I definitely think it‚Äôs possible he shot his shot at what he knew to be straight men sometimes, which is shitty and warrants being called out. Preferably in private, as a friend (...lookin at you Tati)

But that behavior is nowhere near as super heinous as JC was made out to be. I mean dudes are openly pushy with women they KNOW aren‚Äôt interested all the time and no one says boo. 

Hear me out, but JC was a gay kid eager to explore relationships for the first time, and it can be really hard for young LGBTQ people to find each other, so I think a little more grace with the learning curve from his straight critics is appropriate. I ONLY SAY THIS BECAUSE, most importantly, the story that was presented about him was just straight up not true. It‚Äôs clear from the texts the waiter(?) boy in question told him he was curious and wanted to explore his sexuality with him. And then did *multiple* times. And it‚Äôs totally okay to explore and discover something is not for you! But the way JC was depicted as harassing this particular ~totally uninterested~ guy who ~plainly stated his intentions~ into believing he was gay was slanderously untrue and imo homophobic. 

And the fact that JC is in the same spot a year later, having to still deal with allegations NO ONE is providing details for, when he already rebutted the last ones with proof, makes me sad. 

**And Jiffy Scoob hides behind saying it‚Äôs not his place to release the voice memo, yet publicly flaunts that he has it on podcasts to stir shit up for JC. There‚Äôs no way JC can refute this if there‚Äôs nothing out there to address. Jumpingjack Scream just wants to drum up speculation so JC is perpetually trapped in a hellworld where people don‚Äôt know what to believe about him but still have their doubts.**"
10186,2020-06-28 22:41:59,hh8xbg,That was my view on it too was he felt pressure to say something and fast. I don‚Äôt think JC is a menace to society.
10187,2020-06-28 14:49:15,hh8xbg,As I recall Manny had the incident making fun of his Uber driver‚Äôs accent on Snapchat (and I feel like there was something else I‚Äôm forgetting) but the driving sentiment behind his ‚Äúcancelling‚Äù was the idea that he was a ‚Äúsocial climber‚Äù which is very funny claim to make against any particular youtuber given that‚Äôs pretty much part and parcel with gaining a lot of social media fame lol
10188,2020-06-28 14:39:39,hh8xbg,manny's was for being a social climber and being mean to a fan once or something lmao
10189,2020-06-28 14:21:53,hh8xbg,It was for social climbing. I don‚Äôt think he has a racist past. Sorry that was my quick summary
10190,2020-06-29 12:23:13,hh8xbg,Thank you! Tbh I'm kinda glad that even some finnish press writes about this. Now lets hope they write about Jafar.
10191,2020-06-29 23:36:36,hh8xbg,"Wait a sec, do you really think self-made means he literally makes each palette and ships them himself?  LOL"
10192,2020-06-29 23:42:16,hh8xbg,I can't believe you have me defending something in relation to Jegina Stone. but self made basically just means that you made you made your money without coming from a wealthy family or other kind of support. It doesn't mean you hand package and stick labels on everything you produce to get there.
10193,2020-06-29 23:40:34,hh8xbg,"Kat von D isn‚Äôt his mother though 

And what does having customers and employees have to do with it?"
10194,2020-06-29 23:34:56,hh8xbg,"That‚Äôs not  relevant to what self-made means, though."
10195,2020-06-30 00:21:11,hh8xbg,found the fellow lefty üëã
10196,2020-06-28 19:07:43,hh8xbg,"I‚Äôm a woman of colour in the lgbt scope and I just don‚Äôt find her to be this racist bigoted monster people make her out to be. Yes, she‚Äôs done some problematic shit, as we all have at some point, but I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs this hateful racist. I think she examines certain issues from another point of view and that can come off as potentially problematic."
10197,2020-06-28 19:09:23,hh8xbg,She‚Äôs not a white supremacist and I fail to see how an out and proud trans woman can be classed as transphobic
10198,2020-06-29 15:09:33,hh8xbg,Like at this point this is beyond *tea* or *drama* this is serious shit
10199,2020-06-29 16:50:18,hh8xbg,Wait thought she was a natural born man? She is not transgendered?
10200,2020-06-28 20:38:49,hh8xbg,"Absolutely. Especially a sister in law, lol. She only knows Shane through her brother."
10201,2020-06-28 20:39:25,hh8xbg,"> to come forward on social media

Who's saying anything about coming forward on social media? They were happy to support him and his behaviour, they laughed at his jokes, they participated in his content. Everyone closely associated to Shane is in the same boat as him"
10202,2020-06-28 20:27:34,hh8xbg,Ok. Whatever.
10203,2020-06-28 20:45:28,hh8xbg,"Yeah in all fairness to the Adams, does anyone ever do a deep dive into someone‚Äôs past before associating with them?"
10204,2020-06-28 20:39:48,hh8xbg,"HE DID IT IN PUBLIC, FOR ALL TO SEE!"
10205,2020-06-28 13:50:20,hh8xbg,Yeah its a shame he's left that shit up for 7 hours. Like ffs dude.
10206,2020-06-28 13:44:48,hh8xbg,It's more based on the calculation methods they use for the numbers in general based on views and payment averages. The amount earned numbers aren't accurate even when they're working but rn they're broken because of the mass purge of videos
10207,2020-06-28 13:51:38,hh8xbg,"On a twitter thread of someone discussing the issue, if i find it I‚Äôll link it. 

How do you think shane is feeling rn?"
10208,2020-06-28 08:20:22,hh8xbg,"I wonder if she's changed her mind about Shane. She was going hard against Onision for being a groomer and pedo, so she has to take these allegations against Shane just as seriously."
10209,2020-06-28 16:27:33,hh8xbg,Very true! I was just trying to think of a way that J* will yet again come out unscathed lol
10210,2020-06-29 14:46:00,hh8xbg,In her video she said Jeffree played the voice memo for her but she did not record the call they had which is why she has no proof of it!
10211,2020-06-29 15:24:01,hh8xbg,You can't know that a situation happens because of the words of a victim. 'Credible' means she found the voicemail authentic and believable.

10215,2020-06-29 01:31:44,hh8xbg,This is my understanding as well.
10216,2020-06-29 01:27:13,hh8xbg,"I agree, but I just cant trust the internet. There‚Äôs literally a trend going on right now where girls make up stories about celebrities assaulting them, its just so f‚Äôed up. I really want to believe this alleged victim but it all just doesn‚Äôt add up. Why would a ‚Äúvictim‚Äù of assault tell jeffree star of all people instead of going to the police? Thats just suspicious."
10217,2020-06-29 01:26:47,hh8xbg,"There is no victim until a victim comes forward. ""What if"" is not sufficient reason, evidence, or provocation to throw around life ruining accusations. People like The Wolf in Blaire's Clothing prey on your exact logic. He knows people are sensitive about protecting the victims of SA and that they will advance his lies out of empathy for his fabricated victim. I can understand how some people might have been fooled by that whole thing a year ago but if you get fooled twice by the same narrative with the same absolute lack of proof, well...that's on you."
10218,2020-06-29 01:28:10,hh8xbg,Exactly! Details are muddled. I'm an SA survivor myself; we're just outsiders looking through a very small window that JS and Blaire White have crafted for us. I think it's best for us to refrain from judgements for now!
10219,2020-06-29 00:28:58,hh8xbg,if they didnt know about her i dont see how they would be able to state they have a neutral opinion on her? lol
10220,2020-06-29 14:49:22,hh8xbg,Views
10221,2020-06-29 14:16:29,hh8xbg,Maybe she's genuinely afraid
10222,2020-06-29 14:07:14,hh8xbg,That's why Blaire literally called him a monster.
10223,2020-06-29 14:36:13,hh8xbg,"Yes, but Blaire was calling out Jeffree exactly for that....that he SHOULDN‚ÄôT have it and utilize it to his own manipulative advantage and acting like it‚Äôs just regular Tea or gossip"
10224,2020-06-29 06:16:38,hh8xbg,I mean... he deserves prison.
10225,2020-06-29 05:34:35,hh8xbg,And he has so much money he can go to a therapist instantly or go to a fancy inpatient facility. He had unlimited resources.
10226,2020-06-29 05:46:08,hh8xbg,"That's true, very good points"
10227,2020-06-29 07:59:12,hh8xbg,"This is so valid. I mean I don't think he should be getting sent death threats and vile messages, it's literally just lowering yourself to the level of him and J\* but like, I don't want him to hurt himself and then on the other side, he's also in his 30's and surely with all the cash he has, he can entertain himself without the internet so if he goes and reads the comments, that's on him. I feel like Jeffree though would read the hate comments, absorb them into his black pit of a soul and use them to power his meat suit for the next 20 or so year."
10228,2020-06-28 20:01:20,hh8xbg,"This is remembering it from.when it happened, so might not be totally accurate- i didn't/don't watch any of them, so I'm mostly remembering the recaps/conversations around the drama- but basically, he tried to pit Manny and J* against each other by telling the other that they were talking shit, then made a video talking about how J* and Nikki were racist. J* produced some clips and texts of Thomas being the racist one and saying some dickish things, Thomas had a crying apology and got out of Beautube for awhile and when he showed back up on occasion, it wasn't very well received. He seemed to show some personal growth/be in a better place... Then he asked for money for his cats vet bills while showing off his new house, and it sorta went downhill from there."
10229,2020-06-28 19:46:25,hh8xbg,">He got canceled for reasons I don't remember

He and Jafar were in a fight."
10230,2020-06-28 17:43:40,hh8xbg,"I agree. Honestly, as a victim of abuse my self i find it extremely disturbing that someones story is being passed around as tea and the police is not being involved (if it's true)"
10231,2020-06-28 19:44:45,hh8xbg,"For all his talk about receipts, he‚Äôs sure has been hesitant to release any of the dirt himself. I‚Äôm not sure if Blaire got played or got paid by J* into making her vid, but I suppose we‚Äôll find out eventually. Seems like everyone is airing their dirty laundry this week."
10232,2020-06-29 13:35:32,hh8xbg,Libel and defamation laws are hard to prosecute especially if the person being defamed is a public figure.
10233,2020-06-28 10:43:57,hh8xbg,Yep pretty sure it's from deleting videos
10234,2020-06-29 00:08:46,hh8xbg,Tea. I never think about that. Prime example of why I hate having sweat stains in public
10235,2020-06-28 12:28:22,hh8xbg,Don't ever spend your money on internet points lol

10243,2020-06-29 04:16:00,hh8xbg,I've literally been contemplating on doing an entire podcast episode just about this. All of this drama was so predictable and on brand it isn't even funny.
10244,2020-06-28 17:25:32,hh8xbg,"Not really, Blaires video confirms it exists whilst the Keemstar video is just Jeffree saying he has recipts"
10245,2020-06-28 08:32:39,hh8xbg,Well the smiths dragging Shane is pretty significant. Shows this shitshow is going mainstream
10246,2020-06-28 08:30:48,hh8xbg,I think celebrities as mainstream as the smiths denouncing him is some of the biggest drama we‚Äôve ever seen.

10257,2020-06-28 19:27:29,hh8xbg,She's the alt-right side of Youtube's Designated Trans Friend.
10258,2020-06-29 03:25:28,hh8xbg,"Her videos calling out predators who happen to be trans are as helpful as Shane *fixing* controversial youtubers with 5 parts docu-series. Most of her videos are made to prove how ""evil the queer left"" and not really to call out predators or really problematic people at all. She even makes videos like ""J. K. Rowling isn't transphobic you're just sensitve"" and believes that trans women will go into women's bathrooms to creep on them despite all evides shows that's not true."
10259,2020-06-29 16:57:13,hh8xbg,I say keep it. So that people keep signing it. It might motive someone involved to come forward or even go find evidence to hand over to the police. It can show support as a community
10260,2020-06-29 16:36:10,hh8xbg,Absolutely nothing

I sincerely hope there isn't a victim because I can't imagine how fucked up it would be to have your business touted around as someone's backup plan."

In specific, note this line: 'Do I think James Charles was the devil? NO! Do I think he was a young, egocentric power hungry guru who needed to be served a slice of humble pie the size of the empire state building? YES.'

Seems kind of a weird thing to say if you and your friends were sitting on credible details that he'd assaulted someone, yeah?"

10270,2020-06-28 20:07:39,hh8xbg,Why would you even want to speculate over something like that..
10271,2020-06-28 19:49:35,hh8xbg,"Read the pinned comment. You shouldn‚Äôt be upset that we can‚Äôt speculate who it is. If it‚Äôs true, this person has had something extremely personal dragged out as tea. It‚Äôs not our job to speculate."
10272,2020-06-29 16:53:17,hh8xbg,"It‚Äôs nothing major, IMO. I can only think of three instances and am fuzzy on one.

1. Most recently she said because of Covid people will know what people with chronic illness live with everyday by not being able to leave the house or do things. Some people brought up that their family died, that their lungs will be damaged after having covid, and just overall that it‚Äôs not the same. She didn‚Äôt apologize either. She just said people didn‚Äôt understand her point. Which I don‚Äôt feel any different about her not apologizing. I understand her point but also read the room/phrase it better. I get why people were (or weren‚Äôt) upset. I think this was before people really started complaining/protesting quarantine and wanting to go out.
2. She did a video where she ate Chick-fil-a in her car lol. People were upset since they‚Äôre against marriage equality and the LGBTQ community. She did apologize and said she was about to get her hair done in an area she didn‚Äôt really know and that was right by the place or something like that. I‚Äôm pretty sure she left the video up.
3. Something with Victoria‚Äôs Secret. This video I know she took down. It was within the last year. People weren‚Äôt happy with VS and I just remember her saying she had no idea and removed it immediately.

Edit: there might be more but those are what I remember"
10273,2020-06-29 02:59:04,hh8xbg,Yes you are right!!
10274,2020-06-29 02:57:49,hh8xbg,Figured it out. It is Jkissa‚Äôs husband
10275,2020-06-29 02:57:02,hh8xbg,Who is the beauty guru who‚Äôs husband is his camera man? It was someone who also is very unproblematic and I thought it was her but def was wrong!
10276,2020-06-28 22:44:26,hh8xbg,Jstar is alot fo things butt he isn't stupid. If it leaks it would obviously lead back to him.
10277,2020-06-28 22:43:14,hh8xbg,I hope whoever made that voice note were smart enough to put a cease and desist against Jeffree
10278,2020-06-28 19:27:14,hh8xbg,"Exactly. I'm a victim myself and I'm currently dealing with a smear campaign from people trying to paint me as a liar in case my story comes out. My story was also used as blackmail to get someone close to me involved in a divorce settlement. I'm just tired of people treating this as tea or saying that Blaire's video takes the heat of Jeffree when it just shows that every single one of them is pure trash (and this is not a defense of Blaire, I don't even know who she is)."
10279,2020-06-28 19:27:25,hh8xbg,Are you ok? I never said there was proof? I said several people have come out confirming the same story about Jeffree. Yet somehow everyone is convinced that BW is lying without any PROOF that she is.
10280,2020-06-28 21:24:40,hh8xbg,"She is not the only one, for example Ashley Kyle recently spoke out saying the same thing. She showed receipts with Jeffree texting her trying to manipulate and spin the narrative too, basically implying that James r*ped someone. You are saying if they heard it why haven't they felt the need to speak out but I mean they have. Tati made Bye sister. Ashley spoke out recently. Blaire made her video - she says she heard it a month ago. You can't say why aren't they speaking out, and then when they do saying it's all for views. It's one or the other. Btw I'm not saying the memo is in fact credible or real proof. Just that Jeffree is doing this. Watch Ashley's video for his text messages it is gross to see."
10281,2020-06-29 17:22:01,hh8xbg,"Both - look at the screen above, his views for the last 30 days are negative 1.16 billion. His shane channel used to be his 'iPhone' channel way back in the day that he rebranded later, so there was tons and tons of old footage from his edgelord days."
10282,2020-06-29 18:09:50,hh8xbg,"Please edit your initial comment. Don't leave misinformation up, let's keep it tight and clean"
10283,2020-06-28 19:54:09,hh8xbg,"I agree with you. I don't think we should act like he's above it all and can't be cancelled. Maybe it's just how you worded it that rubbed me the wrong way. Totally agree that at the end of the day he's just a person. 

I'm not involved in drag culture and so I didn't get the reference. And to someone not in the community it just seemed like you were discrediting what he created - drama included. I don't really associate Jeffree as being a part of the drag community apart from having drag friends. 

But I think it's not fair to say he hasn't established a network of connections over the years that make it more complicated than ""just don't buy his products"". Are you implying he isn't an A List celebrity? Because I'd argue he has much more of an impact than some A list celebrities. Mainstream media doesn't respect the reach ""influencers"" have because it's on the internet."
10284,2020-06-28 19:59:35,hh8xbg,Oh i fully believe she‚Äôs on Jafar Starburst‚Äôs payroll
10285,2020-06-28 20:00:17,hh8xbg,Blaire White has made her coins pandering to the alt-right and being ConservativeTube's Designated Trans Friend. One of her previous scams was reporting that she and her boyfriend wore MAGA hats to a protest and were assaulted for their trouble. The police said what happened is that the boyfriend went in the crowd of protesters and picked a fight he couldn't finish.

10289,2020-06-28 17:25:31,hh8xbg,"She's also extremely transphobic. She criticizes trans and non-binary people for not transitioning ""properly"". She sent hate mobs after another trans youtuber, Riley J. Dennis, because she didn't think Riley was actually trans because she hadn't started hormones or done surgery, only to find out later that Riley had started hormones and she just hadn't spoken about it publicly. 

She wrote an apology for that but then continued to do it to other trans and non-binary creators."
10290,2020-06-28 17:20:17,hh8xbg,"No worries. I know ashlye Kyle posted the specific video I‚Äôm talking about in one of her recent videos. So that‚Äôs the only reason I know about it. 

I also have heard that there are some issues with how she handles speaking on being trans. But I am not educated enough on that subject to give an opinion that I would be comfortable with giving."

10295,2020-06-29 02:05:40,hh8xbg,"No. They don't owe anybody anything. Jeffree is the one being a shitty friend and ""dragging"" James indirectly through Blaire. This mess is in no way the twins responsibility to clean up."
10296,2020-06-29 05:46:37,hh8xbg,"Absolutely. And people are eating it up. And now everyone is UwU so worried for Shane‚Äôs mental health! 

Sorry we‚Äôre all not doing well, sit down."
10297,2020-06-29 06:02:44,hh8xbg,"I‚Äôm fully aware of what you originally said and not even James would joke about that. If he came out and said ‚Äúit was a joke‚Äù, his career would still be over because of it because we are all aware it isn‚Äôt a joke."

i'm more disgusted by the hatefulness in shane's videos and in his ongoing attitude towards his audience and his acceptance of hateful people than i am of the emotional reaction of people who are upset by his behaviour."

10304,2020-06-29 02:18:51,hh8xbg,"So literally trying to blackmail and threaten a 19 year old, tweeting that he is a danger to society and making everyone (including all of us) believe James was a sexual predator, that‚Äôs something a good person would do? It was not a lapse in judgment or a joke in bad taste or a result of a bad temper. It was calculated."
10305,2020-06-29 23:05:49,hh8xbg,"Ah, makes sense. Still I must have not hung around people who watched Shane Dawson (I‚Äôm about 3 years older than him). Still can‚Äôt figure out why that was okay. 

I still can‚Äôt figure out why the fine brothers ever produced that basically pedo puppet show, since they seem older. 

The only Shane stuff I ever watched was that tanacon documentary."
10306,2020-06-28 12:31:12,hh8xbg,"Yeah, he kind of did. But isn‚Äôt it funny how he changed after starting to hang out with J*? That just shows how bad of in influence J* is. I mean, J* doesn‚Äôt even have... friends? And even if he does, it always ends badly and somehow it‚Äôs always J* that is the ‚Äòvictim‚Äô and it‚Äôs others that are the bad guy. Man, I used to dislike J* but after his video from like back in 2017 where he addressed the racism, I started to watch his videos but he one helluva üêç"

10309,2020-06-28 15:32:37,hh8xbg,I hope she does too. I don‚Äôt mind her content but she shouldn‚Äôt be supporting him after all of this.
10310,2020-06-28 16:29:34,hh8xbg,"so i just rewatched her video - its titled ""upacking the beauty community circus"" and she addresses in the beginning how she's spoken to shane 4 or 5 times, and says he's never given her any ""tea"" or behind the scenes edge like other drama channels are claiming, and she said that she did gain a ton of twitter followers from him shouting her out -- then the rest of her video is her saying you can't leave a community you were never in LOL"
10311,2020-06-28 16:03:00,hh8xbg,"Right, I remember people talking about her buying some of his products. I don't think she should have shown it/talked about it if she was against supporting him, but it's not the biggest offence I guess."
10312,2020-06-28 16:13:58,hh8xbg,She still spent money on it/enabled her mom to spend money on it. She could have refused and said she wasn't going to be part of her mom supporting A KNOWN RACIST. Supporting/enabling others who support racists is STILL SUPPORTING RACISTS. It's past time for us to also hold these influencers accountable. Consistently taking away financial support is the only way this crap and drama is going to change.
10313,2020-06-28 06:20:16,hh8xbg,it's almost as if being separated permanently from j* made their lives better. who knew üòÜ

His documentaries are awful, like a school project rather than professional art, so talks of him being ostracised by Hollywood just make me do a double take cause as far as i was concerned, his navel gazing videos are enjoyed by teenagers on youtube, there isn't a market beyond that for his stuff."

I never thought J* was some God, but I supported him until all of these recent events come up. I feel like the glass has shattered and I see how awful he is. It's sad because I really enjoyed his content and his makeup. I'll use up what I have, but I'm done supporting him."

10391,2020-06-29 16:20:43,hh8xbg,"The whole ""rubber bullet in the head"" thing is a horrible thing to say, but he said it to make a point. The Dollskill ceo is pro police and anti BLM. The BLM protestors are being hit with rubber bullets by the police (that she openly supports) so it was meant as ""have a taste of your own medicine"". 

Whether j* actually cares about BLM is a different matter entirely, but what he said was no worse than what the twitter mob were saying."

10406,2020-06-29 18:10:48,hh8xbg,"I have a question, because I didn't watch Blair's video because I'm not giving Vanessa views: Did she say she actually HEARD the memo? Or did she say he gave her proof the memo exists? I saw some people saying it was actually the second scenario. I know it seems nitpicky to focus on semantics at this point, but since lawyers got involved behind the scenes I feel like people are choosing their words carefully, so it's important to pay attention."
10407,2020-06-29 17:10:47,hh8xbg,True. I think the way you frame it is correct. I just am afraid people will think I‚Äôm victim shaming or something when that really isn‚Äôt the case. If there is a victim they should either come forward or give a statement to someone credible if they feel comfortable enough to. But as of now we have no victims. Only rumors of a victim.
10408,2020-06-29 17:14:28,hh8xbg,Yeah that was my gut feeling as I started actually hunting down whether or not anyone has heard this memo. I wanted to seek confirmation since there are... a lot of people to keep track of in this mess
10409,2020-06-29 17:28:58,hh8xbg,"Yeah I kept seeing conflicting info on whether people had heard it or not and I think it‚Äôs irresponsible HOW MANY drama channels have run with the narrative of ‚Äúwe need to believe there is a victim‚Äù when... there does not appear to be a victim. They‚Äôre falling into the same trap as last year and we need to really question this alleged evidence because no one trust worthy has come forward with it. 


I understand the Dolan twins are still following jeffree but that doesn‚Äôt mean shit until a victim comes forward or we get some credible source of information saying they spoke with the victim. 

If someone comes forward, I will back them. But we cannot turn this into ‚ÄúJEFFREE KNOWS WHO THE VICTIM IS AND IS HIDING IT‚Äù when it still seems like ‚Äújeffree is making shit up and using other people to spread rumors so he doesn‚Äôt get in trouble because jeffree Star is a lying liar who lies‚Äù"
10410,2020-06-29 17:29:36,hh8xbg,"I'm wondering if Jeffree chose Blaire because he was hoping to get her audience of more right-leaning people to go after James - she also does ""catch a predator"" style videos so if she dug up all of the info she could have really damaged him. For what it's worth I do like Blaire a lot and I believe her when she says this is credible - I'm not going to attack James personally over the allegations but there's weird tribalism in this thread about being pro James or pro Jeffree when it is a totally valid opinion that both of them are bad people. The enemy of my enemy is not always my friend."
10411,2020-06-28 07:36:32,hh8xbg,"This is really stupid. You‚Äôre saying that if Joffy Slug comes into this sub to read about himself, he won‚Äôt crack the nicknames?"
10412,2020-06-28 07:34:09,hh8xbg,"Pretty sure he'd get the idea if he saw those nicknames? What are you even on about? I doubt he'd be like ""Jefferson Starfish? Ah yes that other person"""
10413,2020-06-28 07:31:25,hh8xbg,We all know who we are talking about. Even lurkers can figure it out. As long as he is tagged or spoken about on Twitter it doesn't really matter
10414,2020-06-28 07:34:46,hh8xbg,You‚Äôre really choosing to knit-pick the nicknames?  What gives you the impression that this thread somehow dictates his public image?
10415,2020-06-28 07:31:37,hh8xbg,"I highly doubt J Star is perusing r/beautyguruchatter. You‚Äôre entitled to your opinion, but you can‚Äôt mandate what other people refer to him as. It‚Äôs ridiculous to argue that I don‚Äôt care about these issues if I give him a nickname. This is peak gatekeeping."

10422,2020-06-28 20:57:35,hh8xbg,"The sick joke here is that Jeffree is only big when compared to other YouTube personalities. Jeffree is the Donald Trump of rich people. He's ""doing just fine""."
10423,2020-06-29 15:18:36,hh8xbg,"Gosh, I do remember when he said ""We are our own superstar"" in that podcast. I'm like... uhh, ok? I feel like in his head he is a really super-mega-diva-star, a really important person or sth. Like, chill, people outside beauty community/youtube don't really know about 'Jafar Superstar'."
10424,2020-06-28 21:21:59,hh8xbg,"Yeah, but does he have something on James that would take him down? Because on one hand, I know Jeffree is full of shit, but on the other hand, with everything that happened on the previous Dramageddon, I never understood why James didn't sue at least Jeffree for defamation, so maybe Jeffree does indeed has something on James and James had something on him and that's why neither of them took it further.

(Not saying James is a predator. The thing Jeffree could have on James could be totally harmless but James doesn't want it out)"
10425,2020-06-29 04:21:36,hh8xbg,What pet stuff has he done? I never really watched his videos.
10426,2020-06-29 06:27:38,hh8xbg,"Shane should never be allowed to adopt. The videos I've seen so far are disgusting and I honestly think he's a pedophile. Unfortunately he's rich so if he actually wanted a child he could find a way, legal or not. Adoption in the US a huge for-profit industry that's all about that $$$ and plenty of shady shit happens at times. Coercion, manipulation, human trafficking... adoption has it all."
10427,2020-06-29 10:54:54,hh8xbg,"What I mean is that I think that they distance themselves after public perception of people turn. Which IMO isn't a good look, they're not deciding things for themselves, they're just trying to jump off the ship before it's too late"

Plus he never had to give up women completely, so as long as he had a physical attraction to J, I think it probably was a sweet enough deal for it to be real. Or at least as real as anything can be in a pink Barbie house neighbouring the Kardashians."

And I mean messages like tati saying she isn't going to make a video, it's not right or she'll handle it privately but j* pushes her by sharing ""receipts"" of James' wrongdoing and gaslights her into thinking a video is her best and only option. 
Other than that I think if she speaks she will come out of things relatively okay but still burned, it just depends on how burned she'll be at the end of this.

It's become such a speculative situation and I just really hope that if the allegations are true, the victim does not feel pressured to come out and share their story when they don't want to/not ready to.

I know Disney has restrictions and not just with kids. For adult men for instance if they want to do princess photos or whatever, the girls show them how to do a ‚Äúprince‚Äù pose. It‚Äôs not done in an awkward way either. But basically the guy poses his arms and that allows the princess to gently place her hands on their arms but maintain control. This helps cut down groping and empowers young girls to control chaotic situations."

10557,2020-06-29 02:51:19,hh8xbg,"To her it wasn't ""hype"", it was a real situation that she caused. Without Jaclyn Eugenia would never even have gone to recovery. How could she sit and watch as Shane makes a video about her which makes it out to be all sunshine and rainbows when she knows Eugenia is still trapped in a house with an abusive mother who encourages her anorexia..? What kind of a ""friend"" would she be if she was silent and complicit in that BS? 

You say silence is violence, if Jaclyn were silent she watches her friend die.

I hear you on not being friends with transphobes, homophobes etc. But I think it's possible to challenge those views from within a friendship. Jaclyn does not agree with Blaire on a number of things, they have argued on twitter before iirc. I don't like Blaire and I wish they weren't friends but it's possible to be friends with people who disagree as long as there is a baseline level of respect. Blaire has centre-right views which is bad (imo) but she is certainly not a white supremacist, which people seem to accuse her of."
10558,2020-06-28 13:59:47,hh8xbg,"I'm sorry but I've been watching Ryland since the beginning of his channel, and I 100% guarantee that his popularity growth is because he is dating Shane. Shane was the one who convinced him to create the channel in the first place. It's an unfortunate truth but a lot of ppl Shane contributed in helping grow their channels (Shanna Malcolm, Psychic Twins, Lisa Schwartz, Garrett Watts, Drew Monson, etc) were at their most popular with most views & most earnings when Shane was more involved in their lives.

So yes, Ryland will still be financially stable outside the relationship, but the views and money he earned on Youtube is attributable to his relationship and lifestyle with Shane (including the money for the G-wagon)."

10561,2020-06-29 20:05:28,hh8xbg,"one of the biggest criticisms of the redemption arcs of his multiple docu-series is the lack of any real work his subjects did do to reflect and take accountability. they didn‚Äôt even really have to understand how their behaviors were wrong... that‚Äôs the kind of forgiveness shane seems to want. i think that‚Äôs a biggest point of frustration everyone has of his recent behavior. like, everything in the past is horrible and everything he has done (or lack their of) in the present hasn‚Äôt even begun to make up for it.

Garrett is one of the few people I do genuinely feel bad for. I think maybe he saw a side of Shane that surprised him when he was with J* and wanted no part of it, hence the unceremonious disappearing act he pulled off lol."

10627,2020-06-28 20:10:32,hh8xbg,Ya that whole episode with Kathleen Turner was just cringe if you watch it with modern eyes... a lot of misgendering and cheap jokes at the expense of the trans community.
10628,2020-06-28 20:11:07,hh8xbg,"Transphobic is strong considering the jokes were between Chandler, his dad, and his mother and never malicious. This was one of very few shows to actually cast a trans person as a reoccurring character throughout the series. 

*Regardless* That vs Shane making a joke at the expense of Trayvon Martin saying he wouldn‚Äôt have gotten shot and been outside walking around if he had a job are on 2 very different spectrums. You should‚Äôve known that joke was shitty at any point in time tbf. Same goes for his Hitler jokes. But aight"

10635,2020-06-28 22:39:36,hh8xbg,"Yeah right now it‚Äôs become a balancing act of not wanting to put any information that is triggering or implicating anyone in anything based on third party info and not trying to out victims. 

Like lord. The dahvie vanity stuff was bad enough. I‚Äôm just gobstopped."
10636,2020-06-29 03:40:15,hh8xbg,That‚Äôs your opinion.  I‚Äôve watched her for years.  She is neither.  Carry on.  ‚úåÔ∏è
10637,2020-06-29 03:07:46,hh8xbg,Her political views of being a white supremacist POS
10638,2020-06-29 02:32:52,hh8xbg,"Yeah, I‚Äôve been watching her videos for a long time.  Just bc she has diff views though I don‚Äôt see how that can make her as bad as a racist pedophile.  Crazy.  I think she‚Äôs great."
10639,2020-06-28 19:15:06,hh8xbg,"Nobody is saying it's the victims fault. But once again, you can't just have allegations like this hang in the air. It's not right for either party."
10640,2020-06-29 21:40:54,hh8xbg,"She won‚Äôt say anything, she‚Äôll just keep posting weird lyrics then drop a video on a new setting spray or some shiz. Feel like an absolute clown for hyping this"
10641,2020-06-29 16:37:14,hh8xbg,"He has never heard the voice note. He made an assumption based on what was shown in that video. Confirmed that here:


https://youtu.be/fUxfaJDjpgI"
10642,2020-06-29 17:06:55,hh8xbg,"There's no confirmation for the majority of this drama. Most of if is speculation, but if js told half the drama channels, plus Blair he knew like one phone call, what's keeping him from telling Tati?? 

Tati specifically warns JC people might take his actions out of context, couldn't it be that Tati heard what js said and thus gave that warning?"
10643,2020-06-29 14:37:25,hh8xbg,"So, that 5G and amethyst thing everyone keeps bringing up.

 I saw one tweet with her sharing a Seattle news story, and a rambling self care YouTube video that used some dubious symbolism. I haven't seen her say outright ""this 5g is causing Rona, and purple rocks will cure it"" or anything like people seem to be suggesting she did.

 It's irresponsible with her fan base, and a little concerning she doesn't discount them, but she isn't saying not to listen to fauci or something. And I can only find the two times she did it, not an ongoing support for either.

Did I miss something?"
10644,2020-06-28 19:17:42,hh8xbg,"She said she did, but she never mentioned they responded tho"
10645,2020-06-28 19:26:01,hh8xbg,"Sure, but I don't believe Jeffree Star. Its when other creators come out and say they've heard the voice memo that makes me question it. 

&#x200B;

Maybe Jeffree realised that he couldn't leak the voice memo because that would be a horrible thing to do to someone (even though what he does instead it just as horrific) and so decided to back down. 

I really don't want to believe it, and I'll need more evidence before I will, but im just saying that I think James denying the allegations whole heartedly would work in his favour."
10646,2020-06-29 18:22:31,hh8xbg,"I don't actually like Blaire but I can see why she made the video. 

Your comment is just all the reasons justifying why she should stay silent. If jeffree is using this voice recording to manipulate people around him then he deserved to be exposed in my opinion.

You can't go around threatening to expose someone as a sexual predator and not expect someone to speak up about it..? If she exposed the victim's name it would be a different story, but whoever this person is still has a chance to tell their side of the story."
10647,2020-06-28 09:25:38,hh8xbg,One video I saw was from 2017.
10648,2020-06-28 13:14:26,hh8xbg,YIKES YIKES YIKES UBER YIKES
10649,2020-06-29 01:39:04,hh8xbg,"Exactly. I want James to stand up for himself by lawyering up and taking Jafar/Shame/Blaire down legally, not by airing everything out publicly online."
10650,2020-06-29 02:03:43,hh8xbg,"No one is saying that if there was a victim they‚Äôd be lying. They‚Äôre questioning IF the recording exists and if so, why Jeff has it and if it was manufactured or worse.

Why would we believe something that so far is just a vague rumor?"
10651,2020-06-29 01:58:09,hh8xbg,"I mean, there isn‚Äôt  a victim. If and when a victim comes out, I‚Äôll believe them. I think a lot of other people on this sub will too. 
But again, there isn‚Äôt a victim. Blair White said that Jeff Soda said that he has a credible voice memo of an unnamed YouTuber saying that JC assaulted them, and that‚Äôs frankly not substantial evidence. It‚Äôs barely a claim. Voice memos are ridiculously easy to fake, and Jeff has EVERY REASON to fake dirt on James. 
He also lies. He lies about everything. He doesn‚Äôt give a single shit about the victim if they do exist."
10652,2020-06-29 06:34:23,hh8xbg,I find it to be very tastefully subtle shade!
10653,2020-06-28 22:11:33,hh8xbg,I don't believe anything Blaire does is well intentioned.

10657,2020-06-29 05:07:44,hh8xbg,The person he based Jonah on spoke out the other day too and holy shit Chris is disgusting
10658,2020-06-29 05:14:33,hh8xbg,Isn't he a fan of Pewdiepie?
10659,2020-06-29 09:52:13,hh8xbg,"I bet she felt like she got into the 'cool' club. I wonder what made her turn against James. I mean, being friends with a child was weird af, but why did she turn on him so fast and so viciously"
10660,2020-06-28 22:01:55,hh8xbg,"Untrue again. Keep trying, though."
10661,2020-06-28 20:16:03,hh8xbg,"I think we‚Äôre just on opposite ends of the argument then, because I genuinely don‚Äôt believe that if there was a credible memo, it would be staying hidden for so long with how badly JS wants to eliminate James. The community seems split so far on whether or not the memo (if it exists) is credible and some people are already calling James a monster. Again. Without evidence. I‚Äôd say that distraction is hugely beneficial to Jeffree and fully what he wanted."
10662,2020-06-29 00:44:20,hh8xbg,"It's an 18 minute long video and that sentence is supposed to prove the video was mainly about him? 

She mentions how he has recordings and has dirt on people. This is known by everyone, he's said it himself multiple times. The rest of the video is her making claims she conveniently can't prove that don't damage anyone but James. Then she tacks a section on at the end about Shane's in appropriate behavior. Completely ignoring the racism because lol it's Blair.


Also, go back to The_Donald."
10663,2020-06-29 00:04:17,hh8xbg,Except when she is casting false narratives about people who are traditionally the victims of sexual assault being possible perverts and predators just because they don't conform to her own personal experience.
10664,2020-06-28 23:51:56,hh8xbg,Lol she literally made a video about how rape culture doesn't exist
10665,2020-06-28 23:59:31,hh8xbg,"Personally I think it's reaching to say that she was trying to help J*, since it makes him look worse. Maybe Shane."
10666,2020-06-29 05:19:37,hh8xbg,I wouldn‚Äôt agree unless the commenter can actually give us examples rather then being vague
10667,2020-06-29 09:17:44,hh8xbg,Making sexual jokes isn‚Äôt ok. You downplaying sexual harassment is a problem. Don‚Äôt be dismissive; it‚Äôs a real problem in the workplace.

10674,2020-06-30 00:05:03,hh8xbg,"It's an impossible situation, it is so difficult to confirm you heard a memo that apparently sounds like credible evidence of assault. You cannot say that without basically accusing someone of being a predator or pressuring/outing a victim. I think that's why no one is willing to say they heard it - if they in fact did."

10676,2020-06-29 14:52:27,hh8xbg,"We should do a GoT who is who with Bootygurus. Tati is Lisa Arryn. Self righteousness, arrogant and not great at playing ""the game"" plus pushed JC out of the moon door. She also qualifies for Melissandre with her latest bit with crystals üîÆ.  

Samantha Ravndahl is definitely a Northerner: She is direct also her being Canadian adds to the narrative.

 James Charles is hard to place. I would normally say he is Arya because he is young and despite that he knows how to play the game but he is too flashy, Arya operates from shadows. 

Nikki is Dany, she is far away from the action yet always talked about. Also her style of videos (tutorials of glam looks) is sadly a dying breed in today's YouTube, plus she inspired thousands of people to put aftershave in their faces so there is your charisma. 

Jacylyn is def. A Tyrell but she is not as smart as Margeary. She is manipulative and beautiful tho. Also her arc is similar to the TV show: She had potential and power but she ended up being irrelevant and wasted her potential. 

Shame tried to be Varys but he was too evil and actually never cared about the ""realm"". He is also too evil to be anything close to Samwell Tarly. I would say he is Theon Greyjoy minus redemption arc. Put himself into a mess."

10681,2020-06-28 19:58:15,hh8xbg,Okay. Why is she a white supremacist? I have followed her for a long time and she would never say that about herself.

10683,2020-06-29 22:14:22,hh8xbg,People let their bias get in the way of thinking logically. The people who already want to believe that jc did something will believe the info even when it's coming from proven serial liar.

10687,2020-06-29 05:05:56,hh8xbg,"I don't think that is true. He doesn't have to read every single negative comment for his mental state to be affected. By now he knows that they are there (not to mention that this won't just go away in a few weeks) whether he reads them or not. 

I don't think any of us can imagine how it is, other than it must be extremely hard. People are really ruthless online, somehow not saying it face-to-face makes it okay to write whether you want."
10688,2020-06-29 04:42:52,hh8xbg,"I saw that, and not only is he covered with scars, but he mentioned being sexually abused by his Mom‚Äôs BF. He strikes me as a very wounded person, which his whole persona covers up."

10692,2020-06-29 04:25:23,hh8xbg,"I'm not shifting blame at all, I'm just responding to someone saying he has his family there for him with the point that even if they are they aren't necessarily good influences. At the end of the day Shane is an adult who has to live with his actions. I just think his mother is a point of discussion as well when she goes around playing the loveable, christian ""BOOBAS!"" mom while allowing her son to act like this."

10706,2020-06-29 12:53:11,hh8xbg,"I'm confused now.

I'm not referring to the video Blaire made itself as a tell-all. I'm referring to the fact she is encouraging a victim to post a public video or public tell-all about their experience as a coping mechanism and not prioritizing redirecting them to alternative sources that don't feed into social toxicity."
10707,2020-06-28 09:33:15,hh8xbg,Good. Bout time
10708,2020-06-28 11:42:38,hh8xbg,Yea I saw Miss Fame and I'm glad she spoke up. I don't feel like Tracy is gonna do anything tbh
10709,2020-06-29 12:12:14,hh8xbg,"sorry but there is a clear wrong here, if she stands with the victim she wouldn't be putting pressure the size of a boulder on them to come out with a statement, she wouldn't use their story to defend Shane of all people, she wouldn't be hyping this video up left and right yesterday. Monetized or not, it's damage control, she's reframing herself hard, I've never seen a bigger retcon tbh.

Like, for real, she inserted herself in the narrative, it's not like staying quiet wasn't an option."
10710,2020-06-29 13:09:48,hh8xbg,"yeah I did and can you tell me in what way Blaire is helping the victim? At all? 

Because the way I see it, it's just my worst nightmare. My trauma being used as currency. If someone was molested, their story isn't meant to take down James, it isn't to take down Jeffree, it isn't to help out someone that was cancelled. It's for the victim alone."
10711,2020-06-28 11:42:01,hh8xbg,"No. I absolutely do judge people by the company they keep. Slightly more distant friends, work friends, fair enough. It‚Äôs easy to conceal the worst parts of you. People who have already distanced themselves, even fairer. But your partner and closest friends, the people who see you literally every day? Yeah. They know. I‚Äôve dropped plenty of friends and family for racism, homophobia or sexism.  I will absolutely hold celebrities and YouTube personalities to the same standards."
10712,2020-06-28 11:25:12,hh8xbg,I agree. I was friends with a girl for years and didn't know about her abusive past and how awful she used to treat everyone until people told me about her and realized she was treating me the same way. Took me a while to cut her off but we got there in the end.
10713,2020-06-28 11:23:24,hh8xbg,"If they had absolutely no idea and if it came as a huge shock to them, to me that would confirm that Shane has indeed truly changed as a person."
10714,2020-06-28 12:29:25,hh8xbg,"Uhh, no, it is not only when you compile all of Shane‚Äôs mistakes that a problem emerges. Any one of these incidents would have been cause to break it off with him. Seriously, you wouldn‚Äôt have a problem if your friend or fianc√© sexualized a 6 year old or did that Millie the puppet shit?"

10730,2020-06-29 10:29:34,hh8xbg,"I see her stuff in my recommended all the time. I just don‚Äôt click on her stuff because she‚Äôs not very interesting to me.

Her poetry is mediocre and she thinks too highly of it (understandable if you create a poetry book you‚Äôre gonna think it‚Äôs awesome) and her music is blah."
10731,2020-06-29 09:56:26,hh8xbg,"She was also posting things attacking Jessi Smiles AGAIN, saying she's been leading an organised attack against Gabbie for years, tried to call her a sexual predator..."
10732,2020-06-29 09:33:50,hh8xbg,"Im telling you, I'm gonna go to sleep tonight and wake myself up giggling about those responses."
10733,2020-06-29 09:51:49,hh8xbg,"She also tweeted under that ""Its not the fans that scare me"""
10734,2020-06-29 16:06:11,hh8xbg,They collaborated with Jeffree in September last year after that text was leaked. And have liked Jeffree's tweets as late as last week. So I'm sure they're crying on their way to the bank.

10736,2020-06-29 00:33:37,hh8xbg,If I had to chose between literally dying or spending a single solitary moment of an Owens-White podcast is I would be in the fucking ground
10737,2020-06-28 10:06:15,hh8xbg,I think 4th megathread had 6k comments
10738,2020-06-28 14:56:25,hh8xbg,If u watch it tomorrow morning there will be more tea as people react and comment on it!
10739,2020-06-28 15:10:33,hh8xbg,Shame that the best tea happens while we are asleep...
10740,2020-06-28 09:32:18,hh8xbg,He was easily discredited and was called obsessed with Shane. I think people tried but since the source a pos too nobody believed him.
10741,2020-06-28 06:25:00,hh8xbg,"she said ""i stub my toe and say the N-word"" paraphrasing"
10742,2020-06-28 11:05:20,hh8xbg,She is very transphobic which is sad . She justified a lot of alt right sentiments making her the token trans woman for the alt right
10743,2020-06-28 19:00:56,hh8xbg,"You didn‚Äôt come off as argumentative at all! I would never want/expect Tati to out the victim, but (if this voice memo is real) even her tweeting something along the lines of knowing that Jeff is actually hanging onto this (or other messed up recordings) for blackmail could bring him the justice he deserves. You‚Äôre probably right though that she won‚Äôt do it if the lawyers were that heavily involved last year. Jeff gets off on this stuff and she strikes me as having more common sense and moral values (even though Bye Sister was really messed up)"
10744,2020-06-29 04:11:03,hh8xbg,"At this point i think the thing that is killing momentum is that only two people have gone on record saying they heard the memo. Jeffree and Blaire. Everyone else who is said to have heard it has not confirmed it themselves

Everyone is basically realizing this could be another move by Jeffree Star since he is a lying liar who lies."
10745,2020-06-29 04:13:49,hh8xbg,Because she was probably paid to say all of it
10746,2020-06-29 02:30:36,hh8xbg,"no not in that moment but if he wanted to perpetuate his 'james is a danger to society' narrative no one would believe him if he said it himself again so he used someone else. He maybe didn't convince her but fed her a bunch of info that made him and james both look bad, but james look worse. I hope this makes sense it's getting late here."
10747,2020-06-28 09:23:15,hh8xbg,"To me turning a blind eye to something like that counts as being complicit. It just seems, idk.. like Ryland isn't exactly strapped for cash or a nobody himself, so that says a lot about his moral compass if he's willing to ignore all J*'s problematic behaviour for free gifts and attention. I don't believe that Ryland didn't know about J's scandals either."

Luckily I only even bought 1 lip colour and brushes and no other merch"

Because he knows what happened to him and how that affected him...and he still did it...

He‚Äôs a sick fuck."
10754,2020-06-28 19:33:52,hh8xbg,Honestly same üòÇ
10755,2020-06-28 15:06:00,hh8xbg,"I think part of it might have been her friendship with Shane. At one point in the video she was saying that, you know she‚Äôs just a normal person trying her best and sometimes she just doesn‚Äôt know everything that‚Äôs going on. I wonder if it was her preemptively trying to get a head of the serious vitriol that the Internet can spew."
10756,2020-06-29 19:12:30,hh8xbg,"Yeah, that tweet really set people off on a hunt. Plus, his fans have saved content over the years just for themselves so there must be more videos sitting around in a CD-ROM somewhere haha. And people he's screwed over have kept receipts, too."
10757,2020-06-28 12:34:29,hh8xbg,Hahahaha yes someone needs to do that because I wanna know who's deleting videos now to get less heat.
10758,2020-06-29 09:33:18,hh8xbg,"You‚Äôve summed up Shane. And Alissa was like ‚Äúhe pushed me down the stairs‚Äù and shane did not react.

My guess is that he was either payed off my jake and had to make jake look good regardless of what the others said or he just doesn‚Äôt care about others"
10759,2020-06-28 12:33:13,hh8xbg,I think he got a bit of backlash but fell out of relevancy before it really start to hit hard
10760,2020-06-28 12:42:49,hh8xbg,He became irrelevant.
10761,2020-06-28 18:48:21,hh8xbg,"Oh, I totally agree. It just seems silly when people are calling her out for more recent issues and stuff she's not acknowledged, really, so I don't know why she can't just say she's tired of YT and leave it at that. The fact that she privated a lot of videos makes me think it's more complicated than that, though."
10762,2020-06-28 12:29:30,hh8xbg,They're still going but they're not as popular as they used to be. They added a bunch of new people around 5 years ago but then Anthony left so it's never felt the same. From what I see their videos are barely hitting 1M but they still have a lot of subscribers
10763,2020-06-29 04:43:38,hh8xbg,Dude that‚Äôs some bullshit. I really don‚Äôt keep up w youtubers but she made some of the funniest (and just great) videos I saw back in the day. I didn‚Äôt know that happened :(
10764,2020-06-29 23:43:50,hh8xbg,Or physically producing money like building a money machine ?
10765,2020-06-29 23:46:14,hh8xbg,"I didn‚Äôt expect to be here in this thread, of all places,  doing this either"
10766,2020-06-29 23:40:41,hh8xbg,"How is it not relevant? You cannot become rich without taking from others. That‚Äôs not being self-made as that inherently involves others in your ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù.

If it involves status, you cannot have your status be held up without others."
10767,2020-06-29 17:43:36,hh8xbg,"Agree 100%!!! To see it get to this level is sickening. And yeah, James has done dumb shit in the past blurring the lines a little bit with his fame/money (IMO) and outing people, but actually sexually assaulting someone is such a serious accusation.  
I hope to god it isn‚Äôt true."
10768,2020-06-29 18:45:20,hh8xbg,She is trans but she only cares about trans rights if people are trans in the exact same way she is.

10770,2020-06-28 20:45:12,hh8xbg,they were not participating in his content when 99% of his behavior was extremely problematic and there is little chance that either of them actually know how bad it was. They're all essentially family now and can't just leave him because they have serious emotional ties. Instead they have to help him cope and get up and be a better person tomorrow.
10771,2020-06-28 20:56:10,hh8xbg,This sub picks the weirdest stuff to get shitty about.
10772,2020-06-28 13:46:01,hh8xbg,"Yeah, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if that‚Äôs the case either"
10773,2020-06-29 00:52:11,hh8xbg,I find it hard to believe anything that guy says. It‚Äôs all manipulative bullshit.
10774,2020-06-29 00:36:10,hh8xbg,"Okay cool I've heard differing accounts each way. If it ***is*** a third party speaking on it then that adds even more doubt to the situation. jesus christ. I wish there was some way to actually verify things at this point beyond ""he said, she said"" because everything is just really mixed up and gross"
10775,2020-06-29 00:38:18,hh8xbg,COOL. Well I'll go rewatch blaires video to make sure and then change my summary
10776,2020-06-29 02:42:17,hh8xbg,"First let me say, I am not believing shit this time around so easily until I see concrete proof. 
BUT I will also not disrespect SA victims and their feelings as well.
We can agree to disagree."
10777,2020-06-29 01:22:14,hh8xbg,"Probably because they have no feelings about someone they don't know? Idk why that comment is getting so dissected lol. 
She doesn't know this Blair person so has no opinion on her. What's hard to understand about that?"
10778,2020-06-29 08:09:33,hh8xbg,"Because they don't know about them ? It's basically as neutral as you can get, you don't know enough to like/ dislike them so you can be almost completley unbiased"
10779,2020-06-29 14:35:49,hh8xbg,"Of? 

What's there to be afraid of if she had kept silent?"
10780,2020-06-29 06:23:04,hh8xbg,If it turns out that these are more than jokes and he actually consumes child porn or molests kids? Yes. If these are all just sick jokes from a sick mind he needs psychiatric help.
10781,2020-06-29 05:36:59,hh8xbg,Exactly. He has resources available to help him through it. I‚Äôm slightly sympathetic but I think he deserves this fat piece of humble pie.
10782,2020-06-29 13:54:33,hh8xbg,"the thing is, they are alleging that SA took place and that JC is the perpetrator - as damaging an accusation as it can get... if it was some other stupid guru/internet thing id concede that point"
10783,2020-06-28 12:30:06,hh8xbg,Yeah I just hate her sm lmao
10784,2020-06-29 04:03:27,hh8xbg,I can.  And people can people blaming their problems on external factors too.   I guess that‚Äôs a great way to live.
10785,2020-06-29 04:06:32,hh8xbg,Clearly it‚Äôs not just fun for everyone.
10786,2020-06-29 03:47:39,hh8xbg,I don‚Äôt know what you intended to imply here.   But if you‚Äôre saying I‚Äôm wrong then you can just keep blaming your issues on stars and see where it takes you in life.
10787,2020-06-28 09:17:29,hh8xbg,"I keep hearing about these Smiths, who are they?"

10789,2020-06-28 13:45:23,hh8xbg,Not to mention the transphobic people who seem to be dominating the LGBTIQA threads these days
10790,2020-06-28 19:35:05,hh8xbg,Thank you! Going to look at it now.
10791,2020-06-28 19:40:41,hh8xbg,Yeah I don't follow any right wing stuff at all so no wonder I'd never heard of her. Thank you for the info. Some people linked me wikis about her and she's awful.

10794,2020-06-28 22:24:38,hh8xbg,"Yeah that's the other issue, if it is true. It's just as fucked up to use that information as a weapon for what over a year now he's had this memo?? Whole situation is fucked."
10795,2020-06-29 03:27:02,hh8xbg,I think is speculation. Your comment is a bit too assertive.
10796,2020-06-28 20:04:09,hh8xbg,This is getting really messy
10797,2020-06-28 17:00:06,hh8xbg,Didn't Shane have a video where he went on omegle and asked someone to twerk?
10798,2020-06-28 17:01:03,hh8xbg,"The reason she platformed him was to get more information about his crimes against kids. Literally an HOUR after the stream w Jessica, Jessica got arrested. Imagine being mad at her for helping him get arrested"

10801,2020-06-28 21:18:06,hh8xbg,shes not even white..
10802,2020-06-28 20:12:34,hh8xbg,"Can I ask, I'm aware of her iffy views on trans identities which put me off her videos but havent ever been a real fan so dont know much about the racism/white supremacy stuff. What happened?"
10803,2020-06-28 13:49:26,hh8xbg,Thanks! I‚Äôll def check out his video.
10804,2020-06-29 02:10:10,hh8xbg,"I can't pass the racism, but the trans stuff is just your disparity in opinions with hers."
10805,2020-06-28 17:23:57,hh8xbg,Yeah I liked that she brought issues in her community as well as calling out pedos and such but I find it very hypocritical of her to even bring up issues if she‚Äôs doing racist things. Thank u for that I really don‚Äôt need racist youtubers on my feed.

10814,2020-06-28 07:07:34,hh8xbg,"""Bitch is bitter because without him we are doing better"" still applies more now than ever regarding all of Jeffree's ex friends! Crazy Manny nearly lost his career for being in that photo with that caption, and now EVERYONE sees it was so true!!"

10817,2020-06-28 19:37:48,hh8xbg,"Honestly if pretty much any of his docuseries were turned in as a school project, they would deserve at best a C-. Basically no plot, no conclusion, so much biases, not turned in on time (sPeNt aLL NiGhT eDiTiNg - editing what? disturbing stock videos with dramatic voiceovers?), derailing segments that have nothing to do with the subject (morgan's brand trip - what was the point of showing that when he made it a point to NOT bring up a theme of ""drama"" and ""toxicity""?), and essentially incomplete. I mean, are we not going to talk about the Eugenia Cooney video? That one was just straight up irresponsible on so many levels.

I don't know shit about film but c'mon people were our standards this low?"

10825,2020-06-29 14:22:34,hh8xbg,I know what you mean. I think we have to also understand that the average person doesn‚Äôt follow a YTer outside of maybe Instagram and won‚Äôt see any of the buzz and drama. Most of my friends were shocked when I brought up dramageddon and their past but they just see it as ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm not into the drama I just wanna see some makeup.‚Äù And that‚Äôs how they retain a following. That and kids (for the most part) just don‚Äôt get it.
10826,2020-06-28 14:53:05,hh8xbg,Yeah and that peice of shit tried to sue TRAYVONS FAMILY for a few million a few years back. The whole thing is so disgusting
10827,2020-06-28 16:54:27,hh8xbg,Oh it gets way worse than that. /r/rupaulsdragrace is blowing up right now because a girl came out about a horrible inappropriate friendship she had with Sharon while she was underage.
10828,2020-06-28 16:35:08,hh8xbg,That's the least of her worries after what came out in the past 24 hours.
10829,2020-06-29 05:08:50,hh8xbg,"Right?

Out of curiosity, I went and [found the video.](https://youtu.be/_fa5YN7JrHQ) (WARNING! It‚Äôs monetized.) Apparently they broke Ryland‚Äôs garden gnome and it pissed him off, so when they start asking him questions (around 13:49), he also implies that Shane didn‚Äôt help him with putting up Christmas decorations, claims he was asked to pee on Shane, and says he wants Shane to stop jacking off to porn for Christmas. What a winner of a fianc√© üò©"
10830,2020-06-29 04:51:19,hh8xbg,All the expensive designer stuff he buys can be resold.
10831,2020-06-29 05:56:45,hh8xbg,most sugar daddies aren't nice...
10832,2020-06-28 08:21:32,hh8xbg,Right?! It's so crazy how much has changed.
10833,2020-06-28 23:16:13,hh8xbg,Charlie McDonnell if you were a fan? His twitch streams are relaxing.
10834,2020-06-29 04:58:36,hh8xbg,Usually not when your ride is waiting outside the plain. Idk though.
10835,2020-06-29 00:12:32,hh8xbg,"Its okay, IM SCREAMING that she got banned"
10836,2020-06-29 12:37:12,hh8xbg,I think having to deal with Shane is childcare enough.
10837,2020-06-29 12:31:01,hh8xbg,He‚Äôd get more help having the kid on his own
10838,2020-06-29 13:16:47,hh8xbg,He already does all the work involved with the dogs
10839,2020-06-29 12:26:03,hh8xbg,Hopefully he reconsiders. Taking care of a baby baby and an adult baby sounds awful.
10840,2020-06-29 13:33:46,hh8xbg,"Especially in his videos featuring Morgan you can see his upbringing is middle class and seems like a regular person. I think he is just teasing the ""trophy boyfriend"" persona"
10841,2020-06-28 12:04:43,hh8xbg,Period.
10842,2020-06-28 12:40:02,hh8xbg,Ok my view is that Jada straight up stopped the Kardashians in their tracks while they were attempting to drag Jordyn in the press so I don‚Äôt see why they‚Äôd be all buddy buddy now.
10843,2020-06-28 12:11:04,hh8xbg,I forgot about that!!  Has shane ever made any fucked up comments about kkw that could be dug up ?
10844,2020-06-28 14:42:44,hh8xbg,Wow wow I ain't denying that. It's the wording of this comment. It sounds like he was doing something TO her.
10845,2020-06-28 16:43:14,hh8xbg,I‚Äôd also pay to see someone jeffrees own size take him on for all the violent threats he‚Äôs made against women over the last decade. That shit makes my blood boil.
10846,2020-06-29 10:03:37,hh8xbg,That humble pie is getting stuck in his throat.
10847,2020-06-29 15:32:41,hh8xbg,You‚Äôre very correct. I guess I am getting tired of seeing right through JS facade and seeing how cruel he is actually is. Never gonna support ppl like that.
10848,2020-06-28 15:16:45,hh8xbg,Oh gotcha. I was kinda wondering to be honest...

It‚Äôs a sly way for him to hop sides when convenient and try to land on his feet when the final cards are laid. He can say see I was on your side!? Really? Cuz all he has said is he‚Äôs terrible basically. If worst comes to worst he will say see I admitted to what a piece of shit JS is. Best case scenario he will tell JS I acknowledged you‚Äôre shit but I always said you are family.

10875,2020-06-29 04:26:43,hh8xbg,"TW: sexual assault.


When J* did his infamous interviews with the guys in the basement or whatever, he alluded to having evidence that James Charles is the predator he called him out on Dramageddon 2. The stuff that J* orignally said he had but then announced in his half-hearted explanation he wasn't getting involved in drama ever again. It's basically how James Charles came back on top. James doubled down and said there was no proof. J*, for whatever reason, didn't release the voice memo. Which, to me, tells me either J* doesn't have the receipts he said he had or that he's keeping the voice memo in his back pocket for times like these. He's not a good enough person to say, ""This isn't my deal. I'm not going to out someone on the internet over such a sensitive subject.""


That interview, along with the images and videos of J*, is what set all of this off. Had he kept his mouth shut and not said anything about James Charles, I highly doubt this snowball would be rolling to this extent.



Basically, Blare announced she heard the voice memo of a person saying they were assaulted by James Charles. She says J* played her the memo after implying James Charles wasn't the good person she thought he was. She also said in her video she believes the voice memo is credible and is now in a bad position of not wanting to out the person who was assaulted but also wanting to prove what a shit-show and bad friend J* really is. I mean, can you imagine explaining your sexual assault to a ""friend"" and learning he played it for numerous people?



But J* could conceivably come back and say he was just warning people away from JC and was trying to show he really did have proof. The going theory is Blane did this for two reasons. One, to deflect any attention away from Shane. And two, to put more attention back on James Charles, which was what J* wanted in the first place. The fact she's ""calling out"" J* really doesn't matter to her as he's a crafty bitch and can contort this narrative into being concerned for his friends and ""outing"" James Charles at least behind the scenes."
10876,2020-06-29 12:24:14,hh8xbg,"Yeah, J* and Shane are slowly bleeding subs. Trisha is on the decline as of yesterday. Blaire White has added a couple thousand but nothing like an enormous jump in subs.



I honestly think J* has a PR team and is using his ""knowledge"" to ""help"" his friends. Which is really him trying to use them to do his dirty work. He's probably thinking all the focus is on Shane and now James Charles and he's in the clear.



I honestly don't understand how ANYONE is defending any of them. One, J* and Shane are awful people. Period. Two, Trisha, if she's doing the deflection game, is so misguided she's taking on some heat. And three, Blare White is a racist so I'm kind of on the fence about her. Obviously, her judge of character and morals are skewed in my opinion so I don't know how much I believe she's doing this with no ulterior motive."
10877,2020-06-29 03:55:29,hh8xbg,He‚Äôs following tens of thousands of people on Twitter so he probably doesn‚Äôt even know he‚Äôs following him. Grayson has said multiple times he isn‚Äôt gay.
10878,2020-06-28 07:47:56,hh8xbg,"Ohhhh! Gotcha! Yeah that makes sense for sure. Garett is such a sweet lil cinnamon bun it‚Äôs hard to picture him being shady. But if Shane said and did all this horrible shit in the public eye, it‚Äôs scary to think about what he said in private with his close friends. He deserves all the shade, and more. I never thought it was a coincidence Garett abruptly and quietly life Shane‚Äôs friends group. I imagine at some point Shane‚Äôs inappropriate behavior just becomes too much for even the kindest and most understanding of people."
10879,2020-06-28 16:55:00,hh8xbg,Maybe he had a falling out with Shane first and now doesn't feel obliged to support J*.

10888,2020-06-28 14:34:51,hh8xbg,"Yeah, I'm tired of old joke being excused as being made for ""shock value"" at the time.

The Internet is just now more intolerant of this bullshit."

10894,2020-06-28 23:31:29,hh8xbg,"I mean I think it's interesting that tati moved to part ways with both Shane and Jeffree after bye sister. Of course it made sense in that it seems as though they both dropped her once she wasn't useful anymore. And they used a very painful moment in her (and James Charles') life to promote their dumb make up palette.  


But with James Charles being so... carefree??? With his tweets right now while even J\* is hiding under a rock.. It's so sus. Like. IF ANY OF THIS WAS TRUE Tati could come out of the wood work and verify it if she wanted (not that it would be smart) and I think that would scare the crap outta james given what happened last year. But I just wonder what the hell happened. What the heck did Tati find out or hear before which caused her to just pick up and run?  


Anyway, this is all conjecture. The smartest move for tati right now is still to remain quiet unless she has some compelling evidence and a lot of lawyers and a PR team guiding her.  


LMAO now I'm just imagining some epic live stream with tati throwing evidence on the screen and she ends it just like ""And don't worry Jeffre. I'm Coming for you"" AND THEN WE GET A LIVE STREAM OF HER LAWYER HANDING JEFFREE A SUBPOENA OR THE COPS ARRESTING HIM. Tati becomes the new chris hansen. That's her next career move."

- going on about taxes

- hung out with Shane/ryland last week, they are nice

- she says she told shane that if social media effects you badly, then take a break for a while

- so many people want her to expose J*

- whatever is ‚Äòher truth‚Äô is ‚Äòher truth‚Äô (what is true to her is not the same as other people?)

- standing by jeffree gets her more cancelled than anything

- her perception is her reality ; she doesn‚Äôt kiss ass

- they don‚Äôt help each other financially content wise ; they are just friends. People say she is on the payroll but she can afford anything jeffree gifts to her anyway

- make your coin but stop begging her to expose him 

- David dobrik makes jokes against her but she thought it was funny ; it was how the friendship worked

- you can‚Äôt judge a relationship from the outside because you don‚Äôt know how they work

- jeffrees always been nice to her

- she‚Äôll be the first to announce if he says something nasty

- even if someone did body shame her, she‚Äôs not arsed

- there‚Äôs nothing to talk about, nothing to expose

- if someone messes up, you don‚Äôt immediately jump ship

Then she goes on about tiktok"

10918,2020-06-28 15:51:58,hh8xbg,I honestly haven‚Äôt watched her since her wedding videos tbh. I stopped watching in part because of the repetitiveness but maybe after quarantine she‚Äôll have some new energy.

10925,2020-06-28 19:57:21,hh8xbg,"What better cover, though? You see this sort of thing in documented government disinformation campaigns all the time.

10926,2020-06-28 20:00:11,hh8xbg,"No because everyone hates Jeffree right now so no one would watch it or believe her. She pretends like she‚Äôs going to drag Jeffree, so we were all ready to click at 1 Pm."

10941,2020-06-28 22:09:27,hh8xbg,Yeah I wasn't saying it was criminal. I just am not going to support her anymore. Wasn't he working for her for free or really low pay too? It seems super exploitative.
10942,2020-06-30 02:27:53,hh8xbg,"Soooooo much. Too much. The people still defending him need help. While I wish no harm on anyone, Shane needs to leave the internet for good. Enjoy his millions and fuck off (same with Jeffrey Lynn) He's put out way too much harmful and offensive content for the world to see. Racism can be unlearned (and I'm biracial and have family members who have changed their racist views) but pedophilia can't. Sexualizing children is NEVER okay. I watched that ""music video"" with the dick cookies and omg, how ANYONE thought that was funny is horrifying."
10943,2020-06-28 21:10:56,hh8xbg,"I‚Äôve never heard about that Trayvon Martin comment and haven‚Äôt seen it mentioned anywhere? 

Regardless, my point isn‚Äôt that any of these things were ever okay. It‚Äôs that some of these things were in keeping with the kind of things that were produced in mass media.  Again, not okay, but most of us weren‚Äôt educated enough to understand the kind of abuse other people may go through. 

And I don‚Äôt think saying things judging someone else‚Äôs identity are okay if it‚Äôs ‚Äòamong family‚Äô and ‚Äòthat‚Äôs just our humour‚Äô. That‚Äôs what Shane is saying about his videos with his cousin. If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs that it‚Äôs not up to people who are not part of a marginalized group to decide whether things said about them are okay or not."
10944,2020-06-28 21:23:45,hh8xbg,"The jokes I remember specifically from that episode weren't made by any of those characters...

I don't trust Jeffree either but I just don't like how a lot of people are assuming it's fake right off the bat.

If it's true or if it's false, James is likely fully aware of the recording and will most likely be able to easily rebutt it if it comes out. If I were the victim, I'd be terrified to come forward."

When she first started on YouTube, she was just a straight up anti SJW channel. The 3 year old ""rape culture"" video was her critiquing a video of Kat Blaque, and Blaire talks about her own experience with being raped in that very video and does not downplay the seriousness of rape at all. She criticizes Kat for lumping street harassment in together with rape and for saying people don't take rape seriously. Do I agree with that video? Not at all, but I also don't think it's a good example of Blaire not taking sexual violence seriously."

Tweeting 'I have that voice memo' in context which clearly expands to the meaning 'I have a voice memo in which a person accuses JC of molesting them' is defamation per se as it implies criminality and no attempt is made to convey that the allegation is inaccurate or disbelieved.."

If someone heard it-- and if AS MANY PEOPLE heard it as Blaire is implying, I'm sure one of the ten thousand drama channels would have said ""I know for a fact that a specific trust worthy source said they heard it""

I honestly think it's just the fact that he's young and successful and Ben isn't. 

I think Cristine criticized that James disregarded formal education and that started everything. I get why that's a bad message to send to young viewers but whenever the issue popped up, Ben kept throwing shade at him, while there are plenty of other youtubers that do the same. Same thing with retouching photos and unattainable beauty standards, which make things even weirder when you take into account they are (were?) BFFs with Tati ""I lose my nose in filters"" Westbrook. 

He also kept throwing shade at him on Twitter, but I barely use that so. 

There are are things to criticize JC for, but given that Ben goes harder for him than anyone else (more so when taking Cristine's own behaviour into account) I think he's just bitter."

No. It's not okay. You all suck for doing exactly what J\* wanted. You all suck for jumping to ""Well someone else who isn't related to this situation at all said it was real so it must be real!!!"". And you all suck for being dumb enough to not examine your own bias.

10980,2020-06-29 12:42:49,hh8xbg,"She did not defend Shane. She denounces Shane at the end of the video, in a pinned comment, and on her instagram. You can dislike more than one person at the same time."

That's exactly what Blaire was upset with Jeffree about. But Blaire's whole thing is 'exposing' predators, and if Jeffree gave her credible evidence of assault and then she just sat on that information and did nothing, she would be complicit, which is why she publicly came out about it."

I don't see Shane as a purely evil guy. The guys racist, not a mass murderer. You might think otherwise but this is just my opinion an interpretation.

Shane has more subs than js btw. So I don't see the power correlation.  Money, perhaps but he was already well off. Shane from my perspective is just going through the lannister motions til he realises it's wrong."
10988,2020-06-30 02:48:12,hh8xbg,"exactly. This is all so shady. It's irresponsible to run around saying that this is CONFIRMED. ""I heard some people heard it"" Is not enough to prove anything.

&#x200B;

I don't want to out the alleged victim or force people to come forward with their story of how Jeffree shared it with them. It's just like... If this is  really happening I want them to at least go find some trusted source of info to say ""I Heard it myself. I can verify it exists"" so a commentary channel or drama channel or an influencer can say ""I know XX amount of people have come and told me they heard this themselves. They don't want to be named, but I trust their info""

&#x200B;

THATS IT. THATS WHAT I WANT. I'm so tired of the ""Well she SAID that jeffree has been giving it to people"" or ""Well this person said that they heard other influencers heard it"". Like. That's your proof it exists??????? A fourth party account with out any sources???"

10994,2020-06-28 19:17:39,hh8xbg,"Remember a few megathreads ago people were speculating that Tati and JC may have made up? If that did happen *and* these allegations are true, that puts a whole new perspective on all of this. Even if they didn‚Äôt, I think people would start going after her for being complicit and knowing about it but not reporting it if she confirmed she knew (also, I have lots of issues with people just saying GO TO THE POLICE! as if that was so easy). And if the victim wants to forget about this, if I were here I would hesitate before I came out with it so as not to possibly traumatize the alleged victim again. Similarly, if she doesn‚Äôt confirm anything, people will also call her complicit for not coming out with it directly, though I still stand behind saying that her Bye Sister video was her coming out with it. So, she‚Äôs kinda damned if she does and damned if she doesn‚Äôt I think. If it is true, I would like to see key figures in this accusation come forward, but...I understand why they wouldn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know man, this is just nothing but awful all around."
10995,2020-06-29 04:15:12,hh8xbg,But Blaire said she reached out to the victim? So there is someone out there claiming they were assaulted by james. Whether it's true or not is a different story
10996,2020-06-29 03:56:50,hh8xbg,Yeah I agree he was trying to tell as many people as possible to try to get someone to talk about it to make JC look bad and I think he knew Blair would be the one.
10997,2020-06-28 08:25:44,hh8xbg,"Yeah, but Shane's past doing offensive skits was not a secret or particularly unknown. He apologized and moved onto food videos, but people still remembered and talked about it. He continued to sell merch with Shanaynay on it until very recently.

11045,2020-06-28 12:13:33,hh8xbg,i'm not sure to be honest but his skits calling kris jenner names and the kardashians is enough to dig his grave deeper. i think to the kardashian this might just seem like an opportunity to take down someone who is associated with jeffree so that jeffree also goes down by default.

11048,2020-06-28 17:19:59,hh8xbg,He did make a video with the physic twins yes. He included them in a conspiracy video about whether they were together. I don‚Äôt think he ever said they were queerbaiting though. Dan did unfollow Shane.
11049,2020-06-29 17:53:24,hh8xbg,"It‚Äôs messed up how many channels I‚Äôm seeing run with the narrative that the voice note is confirmed. I‚Äôm not a drama channel. I‚Äôm an artist who takes care of a couple of cats who was laid off and I have free time and animal crossing on my hands. If I was able to put this together and start to understand that this isn‚Äôt adding up‚Äî people who do this as their job need to step the fuck up. 

Like. The only advantage I could possibly have (given that I have zero connections or resources) is that I love Batman to a possibly unhealthy degree and I‚Äôve got adhd. Which means I go randomly into super hyper focused detective mode because that‚Äôs how my Brain functions."
11050,2020-06-29 17:30:42,hh8xbg,Yeah I think jeffree is banking on that concern since many of us in the make up community are very concerned with believing victims. But as of now there is no victim. There is only jeffree Star. And I refuse to spread anything he claims as proof.

It‚Äôs definitely the Wild West still. They have conventions and merch, but the regulation isn‚Äôt there. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think it‚Äôs cool so many talented young people can upload for free. But when they get to the levels of Shane or whatever, there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any recourse or complaint process. Onision still makes money off his terribly inappropriate sexual content.

11079,2020-06-28 15:43:49,hh8xbg,That‚Äôs my confusion! Really let down with no further explanation. But I guess the quality of her content comes with all the time and energy she spends researching and editing her videos.

This post was filled with complaints about how J* was going to get away with it yesterday, but you guys think that he was sweating and felt the need to get her to release this video smearing him?

You don't have to buy that the memo is real or even exists to simply agree that he's shitty for trying to use it to his own benefit."

It sucks she‚Äôs said hurtful things, but she‚Äôs not nearly as abhorrent as a pedophile and white supremacist, and I would die on that hill.  That was the only point I was trying to make.  :)"
11095,2020-06-28 19:35:11,hh8xbg,"There isn't a solution here that doesn't involve the victim speaking out. If James is forced to address this, then it will probably involve the victim's name. At that point, the victim will probably have to speak up."
11096,2020-06-29 14:54:56,hh8xbg,"Okay, I just hear it mentioned around here like she is the new kvd (although tati is in favor of vaccinations) which I find kind of irritating. 

 I can totally see her being a bit too trusting (and would explain why she was cool being friends with j* with ""I haven't seen any of the woman hate or racism and we bond over makeup"" line in addition to his killer manipulation skills we are seeing more and more of). 

I can also see her using goop cuz she does have that money to burn, but it could easily be a ""pamper yourself"" kind of thing and less ""I think this will actually do X"". With such a large audience even that is worrisome to share at times, but I'm glad she is smart enough not to outright come out in support of any of these things."
11097,2020-06-29 03:11:38,hh8xbg,"But with the accusations against Jeff and Shane, they are actually visible. We have seen the actual accusations. All we have here is the word from a known liar that someone accused James. We don‚Äôt even know for a fact that someone has indeed made an accusation"

11102,2020-06-29 10:30:33,hh8xbg,He has power and a fan base that's as toxic as he is.

And oh god, I don‚Äôt even want to think about how much more complicated things could really be behind the scenes. This whole ass mess has me watching a lot more of the smaller beautubers because I just don‚Äôt trust what my views and support are funding at this point. üò©"

11106,2020-06-29 00:08:12,hh8xbg,"Yeah, but it comes across as an afterthought at the end of the video, which is why I'd get why someone would think she's trying to deflect attention away from him."

It's hard to tell someone to just ignore all the hate to getting now. It really is a Maelstrom or a tsunami of negativity that no one is really prepared for. His family, his Friends, everyone who's ever known him is probably getting contacted and threatened. I bet he's getting a lot of death threats and threats against all of his family and friends. That's really scary."

11112,2020-06-29 13:24:40,hh8xbg,"Agree to disagree then. I don't think she should have even entertained the idea that she suggested and peddled for that in a video. Sure, it may have tied up loose ends. However, a public SA experience video that contains a significant degree of sensitive information to tie up loose ends of some fucked up situation overall to satisfy audience curiosity makes me feel icky? Displaying an immense amount of vulnerability knowing that I'm satisfying someone's agenda like J\*'s in taking down someone else? Opening myself up to a wave of criticism by the internet?"
11113,2020-06-29 13:11:07,hh8xbg,"she did defend Shane, she just didn't defend his comments. She called him her friend multiple times the last few days, as a matter of fact."
11114,2020-06-29 14:03:22,hh8xbg,"but in doing so, she did the same thing. You see what I mean? She *should* do nothing. Doing things isn't helping anyone. If she thinks someone is a danger to society, there are other ways."

11117,2020-06-30 02:58:47,hh8xbg,"YES! Or I'd like James' attorney to get involved and force this bullshit narrative to stop. If the victim comes forward on their own terms I will absolutely keep up the energy and cancel James, but right now we've got nothing."
11118,2020-06-29 16:55:57,hh8xbg,">	he's essentially just there for the money

That's literally him supporting the bullshit tho. He's actively profiting off of Shane's shit so I don't see how he's somehow immune to being called out. Same goes with Ryland. If people are going to go after people that haven't spoken out against them fast enough then people like Morgan, Andrew and Ryland are just as bad. Tolerating it for money is to me a lot worse."
11119,2020-06-29 16:12:48,hh8xbg,"Yeah, their name shouldn't have been in this drama in the first place."
11120,2020-06-29 04:25:05,hh8xbg,"She said she reached out to the victim but she never stated what their reaction was. And her saying she reached out doesn‚Äôt mean that she couldn‚Äôt be lying or that the voice note that she heard wasn‚Äôt inauthentic in some way. 

My point is that only two people have claimed to have heard this memo. Two people who have shaky track records and one who has been proven time and time again to lie when it suits him. 

If there is a victim, they deserve empathy and justice. And it‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm ruling out there being a victim, I‚Äôm just pointing out that this whole thing is shady and sus."
11121,2020-06-29 04:32:17,hh8xbg,"Yes but she never says there was any sort of conversation or dialogue between them. I could send a text to a friend, not hear anything back. However, I have technically ‚Äú reached out to them‚Äù 

No new fresh information was in her video regarding James that wasn‚Äôt already in the public domain üôÑüôÑüôÑ she only made the video because she was angry that ‚≠êÔ∏è didn‚Äôt back Shane publicly about him not orchestrating  dramageddon 2.

11150,2020-06-29 15:02:23,hh8xbg,which video are you referring to btw?
11151,2020-06-29 21:34:49,hh8xbg,yeah someone commented on here with a spreadsheet of them!
11152,2020-06-29 17:28:13,hh8xbg,Absolutely
11153,2020-06-28 08:22:17,hh8xbg,"If I‚Äôm remembering correctly they met via tinder? Grindr? One of those, and Garett didn‚Äôt know who Shane was but they clicked immediately as friends. If I had to guess I would imagine there would be no way of him knowing just how dark and horrendous Shane‚Äôs past was unless he went back and looked at all the stuff starting around 2005. There is honestly so much horrible shit that idek if it‚Äôs possible for us to even know it all. I have a feeling Garett saw Shane starting to slip into Jafars world and was just too uncomfortable with it. He looked really really uncomfortable in the videos he was in with Jafar *. I‚Äôm not sure we will ever know the reason why Garett and Shane stopped being friends but either way, good riddance. Garett deserves better. He and Morgan seem like they may still talk and be friendly. Morgan and Garett were always my favorite of that whole group."
11154,2020-06-28 17:38:04,hh8xbg,"Well that sucks for the victim. This is just gross all around. I like fun petty drama, this is just sickening."
11155,2020-06-28 07:43:19,hh8xbg,"Not really. She's definitely called him out a bunch especially in the last like, six months."
11156,2020-06-28 12:47:19,hh8xbg,"What i meant was, that while it may not be run by shane, the content on the channel was still released by Shane. The shananay channel is kinda like a museum of fucked up shit shane has done. Sorry if i worded it wrong"
11157,2020-06-28 16:12:10,hh8xbg,"I think you hit the nail on the head there ‚Äî everyone can upload for free. All this is proof that maybe, platforms should be held accountable for what their top tier stars do. Specially the ones partnered to the point they‚Äôre having lunch with the CEO to discuss career moves...

YouTube and Twitch both have harbored people who use their fame and power in the community for unsavory stuff, and nothing is done about it because the companies say ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt control who uploads!‚Äù"

11159,2020-06-29 15:07:42,hh8xbg,Yeah. I don‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs much risk of him having CP or something. Although typing this I almost understand their logic. Like it seems dramatic but can you imagine if they found something?
11160,2020-06-29 16:23:50,hh8xbg,"Exactly. He was trying to make her cringe by being as sick as possible but he absolutely did not say he masturbated, tf? Like the clip is available do people not even bother listening.."
11161,2020-06-29 18:09:10,hh8xbg,"Sorry, deleted. You are absolutely right I got confused with something else"
11162,2020-06-29 14:58:37,hh8xbg,That‚Äôs such a bs excuse. Like it was literally max 10 years ago. My dad grew up like 50 years ago and managed not to be a fucking racist.
11163,2020-06-29 11:28:03,hh8xbg,"Honestly the way she talks is very mesmerising, if she didn‚Äôt go on about sex so much I‚Äôd probably listen to her podcast regularly"
11164,2020-06-28 17:47:39,hh8xbg,"I‚Äôm not gonna say that the Dolan‚Äôs don‚Äôt have their own reasons for unfollowing James, but I‚Äôm not gonna also try and speculate over who it was if they‚Äôve stated that they don‚Äôt want to come forward."
11165,2020-06-29 03:57:49,hh8xbg,"Hi, please do not misrepresent what I said. I did not say what she did OFF CAMERA to save her friend was selfish. I supported her through all of that, I was a patreon for years. When she made her video immediately following Shane's the *language* she used were very selfish. She did not explain her positions well because she was being reactionary and mad, yes at the portrayal and dismissal of her mom, but she was mad because Eugenia called her a hater and Shane was getting credit for helping her. It was selfish, down votes be damned. Just because you're more invested on typing shit up and I cba because JG is a POS who isn't worth the effort doesn't mean you get to misrepresent me like that."
11166,2020-06-28 16:21:24,hh8xbg,You‚Äôre right! I completely forgot that she used to have people who helped her and Tyler with editing and other things.
11167,2020-06-28 15:47:09,hh8xbg,"It‚Äôs not like these creators are making 3 hour Scorsese level movies. They‚Äôre making 17 minutes videos about jeans with clear patches. How much planning has to go into; buy ugly clothes, talk about how much they are, then wear them around the mall in LA then go home and don‚Äôt recommend them? Boom üí• video planned."
11168,2020-06-28 20:02:36,hh8xbg,"With the increasing attention on what happened in previous Dramageddons, he needed to deflect back to the idea that the Cancelling of James Charles was legit."
11169,2020-06-28 20:03:31,hh8xbg,He‚Äôs definitely shitty but we already knew he was running around telling people this information. Her video didn‚Äôt make him look better or worse because we already knew. It makes JC look absolutely horrible.
11170,2020-06-28 20:39:20,hh8xbg,We don't know that to be true at all.
11171,2020-06-29 21:56:14,hh8xbg,Picked it up from BGCJ last week lmao. It was too good.
11172,2020-06-29 01:56:27,hh8xbg,That's great. People are too invasive

11175,2020-06-28 22:39:35,hh8xbg,"I don‚Äôt think anyone involved will be able to come out of this smelling like roses. They‚Äôre all getting their names dragged... J*, SD, JC, Tati... who knows what other names are gonna come out. 

Same here... I‚Äôm twice shy about supporting large influencers after this. I‚Äôm ashamed that I followed Janky Slurs and bought a product from him. I can‚Äôt even look at it anymore ‚òπÔ∏è I guess I‚Äôve eaten my slice of humble pie as well ü§°"

11177,2020-06-29 13:45:24,hh8xbg,"That was a terrible analogy on my part. But someone is lying in this situation. Either J* is threatening and slandering JC to an unforgivable life ruining degree, or JC is an actual predator and there is an actual victim out there rehashing a lot of traumatizing things. Every element of this situation should of been handled privately, yes, but unfortunately now it‚Äôs all public knowledge. Also encouraging a victim to come forward doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean make a TY video or make a public statement. It could just mean tell the appropriate authorities."
11178,2020-06-29 13:21:56,hh8xbg,"She called him a friend, in past tense."
11179,2020-06-29 14:03:34,hh8xbg,"I dunno, she seemed pretty bummed to find out this info. She was stronger with her language in her Instagram stories, alluded to her friendship with him being over. She definitely didn‚Äôt defend Shane in the video. 

Jeffree is getting lost in all of this."

But it's so ridiculous. The waters are so muddied by last year and James being able to so soundly debunk all the sudden accounts coming from random boys of him pushing boundaries. It's like- if there is an actual victim, Jeffree star has screwed them over in his lust to take down James. Like jesus christ jeffree."
11182,2020-06-29 16:28:38,hh8xbg,Jeffree brought their name into it cause he‚Äôs a pos that involves people almost half his age.
11183,2020-06-29 04:47:57,hh8xbg,"Ashley Kyle also alluded to have heard the memo. 

also if you look back at the texts that JC showed that J\* sent him during Dramagadon 2.... let's just say that its not the first time these molestation claims have been made by j\*."
11184,2020-06-30 02:01:24,hh8xbg,"If you bought it and the money is J*‚Äôs already I don‚Äôt think anyone will judge you for using up what you have, if you really love it I think it‚Äôs ok to keep and pan. Just don‚Äôt buy any new things from him."
11185,2020-06-30 02:17:28,hh8xbg,"look into indie brands as well, they usually have more fun color stories. Like Menagerie Cosmetics, Copacetic, Coloured Raine etc"
11186,2020-06-30 02:11:44,hh8xbg,"nothing wrong with loving them,  you already own them,  I've seen some ppl say they want to de-pot, others try to associate it with like how their mom got it for them etc.  idk what colors it would dupe from cremated, but JD Glow Cosmetics have my fav cool toned grey/beige mattes (also crazy gorgeous multichromes and glittery shades )"
11187,2020-06-29 23:57:14,hh8xbg,So what exactly is the issue?
11188,2020-06-30 00:08:03,hh8xbg,"Just think about it. Nobody can start a business without at least some money. So when their business eventually makes money, its an increase from what they started out with. Which part of this is hard to understand?"
11189,2020-06-30 00:06:49,hh8xbg,"I mean, I don't disagree on the wealth disparity, we been knew sis, but that's STILL got nothing to do with the definition of what is or isn't ""self-made"". 

The term refers to wealth acquired (through various means, shady or not), and not inherited. The ethics of capitalism are, of course, lacking, but you seem to be taking the term ""self-made"" extremely literally, which is absurd. It's a hyperbole. No one expects a person to LITERALLY live alone in a shed in the woods and somehow make lots of money off his own back alone."
11190,2020-06-29 17:55:21,hh8xbg,"I just hope he gets his comeuppance, it‚Äôs not happening fast enough for him"

11199,2020-06-28 22:10:44,hh8xbg,She supported Jeffree and Shane by deflecting blame. Support isn‚Äôt always straight up saying ‚ÄúI support ____‚Äù
11200,2020-06-29 17:12:17,hh8xbg,"Yeah, after sleeping on it a bit, I feel like I was being rude replying to you yesterday. But I still think that J* and his crew are biased sources at best, and believing their narrative without question would make the truth harder to find."
11201,2020-06-28 21:52:28,hh8xbg,"Nope, pretty sure she has said ‚Äúim white‚Äù."
11202,2020-06-28 17:44:03,hh8xbg,How can she be a white supremacist if she isn‚Äôt even white
11203,2020-06-28 08:11:11,hh8xbg,"Ok... still confused about the relevance in this comment thread regarding Shane‚Äôs previous docuseries on people like Grav3yard girl, and selling out with a palette?"
11204,2020-06-28 14:59:05,hh8xbg,">	several earlier comments saying that we should probably refer to Jeffree Star by name 

You didn‚Äôt make those comment in this chain. It‚Äôs confusing. Without going through your post history to find the comments you only referenced now, your comments in this chain seem combative and don‚Äôt make sense. 

I get the point you‚Äôre trying to make about his name but you should probably fully state that before getting upset people don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about."
11205,2020-06-29 17:47:34,hh8xbg,"Yeah this is why I wanted to kinda crowd source the info. Because I feel like if there‚Äôs just a huge solid list of people we can say haven‚Äôt heard the note, it‚Äôs easier to see how shaky this piece of so-called evidence is."
11206,2020-06-29 18:52:06,hh8xbg,"either way. It is not our place to theorize and speculate and attack people based off of half truths and a lack of information. No one has come forward to say anything about this in either direction, anyone who claimed that james charles victimized them was proven to be lying or exagerating. If all we have is that one text from jeffree? That isn't anything to go on. Jeffree star is a proven liar and as of right now there is no victim who has come forward. period."
11207,2020-06-28 16:16:40,hh8xbg,"I can understand YT wanting to be purposeful with restrictions. But their implementation doesn‚Äôt add up.  I think especially if your content is directed toward youths, and they are a massive creator, they absolutely deserve more scrutiny. If your making all of this money off kids, we gotta know what your about. 

That said, I don‚Äôt think they will be able to keep getting away with not addressing these creators and massive floods of complaints. Like....it‚Äôs not just a couple people with a grudge here. This is serious."

11211,2020-06-28 17:01:47,hh8xbg,"I opened her About on YouTube where she lists Team Saf and it's 7 people including her and Tyler. I wouldn't have guessed! I think she's used to making videos with a crew like on Buzzfeed. Her videos are quite well-made. Shane would benefit from having a team, but unfortunately, he's a terrible director."
11212,2020-06-28 16:07:53,hh8xbg,She does a lot of talking in her videos and almost the entire time she‚Äôs showing pictures of what she‚Äôs talking about and explaining the history of the fashion trends. I get what you‚Äôre saying but she definitely puts in some research.
11213,2020-06-28 20:29:41,hh8xbg,"But no one cares about Dramageddon anymore, their little scheming is almost laughable compared to the REAL info that's been coming out about Shane, which is absolutely horrible. Jaffar isn't the one in everyone's mouth, he isn't the one who had to make an apology video, and people are barely even mentioning him. He was sliming his way out of this, yet again. He knows how to do it.

Purposefully inserting himself into drama, and in an unflattering position, doesn't make much sense. Like, he's in a bad position here - why does he have these recordings? Who made them? Why didn't he talk sooner? Why didn't he go to the police? Why not let the victim decide what they want to do? 

I'm not saying he's NOT behind this, I just don't think it's a smart move, and he's not dumb at all, that's why Shane is currently going down and he isn't. Shane is a stupid fuck, Jaffar is way more cunning."
11214,2020-06-28 20:37:25,hh8xbg,"You already knew, but who is us? Nobody outside the sub keeps tabs with the whole story."

11217,2020-06-29 04:51:18,hh8xbg,"Ashlye Kyle said she didn't hear the voice memo. She said jeffree told her he had one. In fact, I literally asked her on twitter if J\* and Blaire were the only ones who have heard it. She said she could only speak for herself, but the only two people she currently knows of who heard the voice memos is jeffree and blaire.  


And those were just the texts J\* sent during Dramageddon 2. They're talking about the same situation because this *is* the voice memo in question.  


This is exactly what J\* wanted. Instead of focusing on him and all the crap he's pulling, he fed this info to blaire. She made this video. And now everyone wants to now say ""THE VOICE MEMO EXISTS AND ITS TRUE!!!""  


Except only TWO PEOPLE have heard it. And again. Both of them have shaky track records and one is a huge proven liar. Like. He literally lied about the same exact thing with Dahvie."
11218,2020-06-30 00:27:30,hh8xbg,"No need to be patronising. Sometimes people find it harder to grasp certain concepts. I like to try to and understand them though but not with people trying to make me out to be d*mb. 

And I get all that but then it gets to the point where are they actually truly earning it? I mean, that‚Äôs the point in profit, right? Is profit truly earned? I didn‚Äôt meant to go down this rabbit hole at half 1 in the morning but here I am lmao"
11219,2020-06-30 00:20:42,hh8xbg,"I mean, maybe it‚Äôs my ADD (I do take some phrases literally and it takes me time to fully understand them). I just find the term seems to forget about those around the person that help acquire said wealth for the person in question maybe a bit too conveniently, if you understand where I‚Äôm coming from, E.g. the people who the person is directly acquiring the wealth from. I hope that makes a bit more sense."
11220,2020-06-29 20:26:59,hh8xbg,Indeed!
11221,2020-06-29 01:16:28,hh8xbg,"J\*'s account is more damning for him tho. Essentially saying he doesn't have a first hard account of what happened.  


That said, it doesn't change the fact that I don't trust any info that anyone says they got from J\* at this point. Not because the person relaying it is untrustworthy, but because Jeffree star is a lying liar who lies"
11222,2020-06-29 01:20:00,hh8xbg,"i'm with you there. The fact that the facts don't match up is weird. And i don't believe anyone has come out and stated that they have heard the voice memo themselves beyond J\* and Blaire. I'm not sure if shane said he heard it and it's theorized that Tati probably heard it. But even Ashlye who spoke on the voice memo said she never heard it herself. Which... it's weird. I feel like Jeffree would send that shit to drama channels immediately if he did have it and it was damning. Not even the channels ""in his pocket"" (Previously or currently) have said they heard it.  


I mean idk. is there a more comprehensive list out there of who has actually heard this shit?"

11237,2020-06-29 18:02:12,hh8xbg,Very true. I commented in another part of this thread that a voice memo as evidence is very shaky anyway. I can trick my brother into thinking I‚Äôm our mom on the phone and ... people can do impressions. It‚Äôs very hard to get any real confirmation from a voice message alone.

And yet no one else has claimed to have heard it. And, again, Like... four of the drama channels I know of (Who are part of the main group) have said they have not heard the audio clip...  


If there really is no clip or J\* Faked it somehow he is making an insane gamble"
11240,2020-06-29 01:50:02,hh8xbg,It truly is an insane gamble. He really thought he had leverage but I hope he has tangled himself up in some legal mess that leaves him bankrupt.

At the very least it seems like a lot of people are questioning blaire's motivations but I unironically had someone call me a James Charles stan on twitter for saying that Jeffree star was the true predator here... and then I went to their page to block them and they were literally talking about how Jeffree is a genius who did that on purpose because he knew Blaire would talk about it and this would bring JUSTICE to the victim or some nonsense and i'm like

EDIT: Has J* even said anything in Shane‚Äôs defense?? So much for them being attached at the hip, huh"

While Shane is now being held accountable (rightfully) for lots of bad behaviour this all originated with him being called out for his part of dramagedon. 

J* is sitting back hoping this will all blow over."
11262,2020-06-28 03:18:52,hh6cwi,Right! Shane did so much for his image and now he is silent af
11263,2020-06-28 02:21:56,hh6cwi,The twitter thread has people I wouldn‚Äôt have thought caring now commenting that he should lose his channel. There‚Äôs also an article as well in the megathread.

11265,2020-06-28 03:06:06,hh6cwi,Someone posted on Twitter he said he is going on a trip with his grandmother but  used an old picture. His nails don't match a story he posted recently
11266,2020-06-28 02:27:31,hh6cwi,"I think most people, such as myself, just didn‚Äôt know. That video was on his side channel which I didn‚Äôt even know existed. The only videos of his that I ever thought were worth watching was his conspiracy stuff, his vlogs and whatever else just never interested me. Had I known about that stuff, I would have never given him views."
11267,2020-06-28 02:35:20,hh6cwi,"The video of him is from years ago. Back when Willow was famous for her song ""Whip My Hair"" making her like 11/12?ish when Sh-ne did this. Somebody correct me if I'm wrong, please!"
11268,2020-06-28 02:28:44,hh6cwi,"A video from years ago resurfaced of Shane miming masturbating to a poster of a very young Willow Smith. Willow started trending because of it and now, well, clearly her family has seen it. 

One of the most powerful families in Hollywood just put Shane on their shit list."

it‚Äôll be interesting to see how this plays out, morgan unfollowed jefree on instagram so i guess the dynamic is getting tested"
11271,2020-06-28 02:34:41,hh6cwi,"yea honestly. as someone that was a fan of his when i was younger (middle school) i found the content funny and stupid, now as a 21 year old i‚Äôm realizing he should have been finished a long time ago. 

he never showed growth based on who he‚Äôs become in the beauty world and who he associates himself with. everything has just been bullshit excuses"
11272,2020-06-28 02:24:13,hh6cwi,"Honestly though. It baffled my mind that he said that. Who is he to decide who deserve a slice of ‚Äúhumble pie?‚Äù

Plus who isn‚Äôt self-absorbed and in their own messes at 19?? Every 19 year-old has tons of growing to do, no exceptions. It‚Äôs so immature  and gross that James‚Äô near career downfall was waved off by Shane as ‚Äúwell, J* was just excited to see a competitor fail‚Äîthat‚Äôs all.‚Äù"

It‚Äôs weird to say you wouldn‚Äôt do something that you then go on to explain why you did but to continue to say it‚Äôs not real, but you did it and have excuses for why.."

Dawson instead claimed he would ‚Äúnever talk about a child in any way that is inappropriate.‚Äù In the video, Dawson continued, ‚ÄúThat is disgusting, that is gross, it is not something I would ever do. It is something I did for shock value or because I thought it was funny  

Love how he contradicts himself here. Says he would never do that, but then says he did, but for shock value & that it's funny.  What a creep."

11293,2020-06-28 15:52:07,hh5z3u,"He has sex offender vibes. Something about him is seriously creepy/unsettling.

I don‚Äôt watch youtubers out of habit, especially not the beauty guru/toxicity whores, but every now and then Facebook algorithms would throw a strong left turn and I‚Äôd find myself compelled to watch him the way one ends up watching a car crash. 

It makes me uncomfortable, whatever it is."

11306,2020-06-28 12:47:51,hh5z3u,"Well, what kind of narcissistic psycho family lets their 11-year-old daughter become a celebrity and pose for poster sessions? As far as I‚Äôm concerned, that‚Äôs the real child abuse. What do you expect when you put your innocent virgin child on a platform for the world to look at? 

Getting a lot of negative feedback from being misunderstood. My point is that creeps exist in this world, and it‚Äôs naive and foolish to think that creeps are not going to do what creeps do. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre creeps. 

Therefore, if you‚Äôre going to allow your 11-year-old child to be in the public spotlight, EXPECT the creeps to be creeps. I‚Äôm not blaming the victim, I‚Äôm simply saying ‚Äúwelcome to the sick world we live in, and if you want to protect your children from it, DONT put them in the public spotlight!‚Äù 

And that goes for all social media! Don‚Äôt post pictures of your naked babies or 4-year old children in two piece bathing suits from your beach vacation to your social media accounts. Why? Because there are CREEPS out there!!"

Imma keep it that way, thanks."
11311,2020-06-28 11:10:42,hh5z3u,TLDR: Shane Dawson is a old YouTube who got famous for doing videos in black face making fun of what he thought a black girl acted like.
11312,2020-06-28 14:50:30,hh5z3u,"I don‚Äôt know who he is, but it‚Äôs safe to say most of us are familiar with  that Smith Family."

11328,2020-06-28 15:25:40,hh5z3u,"....Willow was 13 at the time that photo came out and was fully clothed while the 20 year old was a shirtless male friend. It sounds more scandalous than it really was and you can restrict your family however you want but, many people have family friends or cousins that they‚Äôre very close to in a platonic way. You don‚Äôt know the relationship beyond that 1 picture and don‚Äôt know who else was there or if anyone was monitoring the situation.

Shane has a sketchy past, you gotta admit that. Even factoring in Will and Jada‚Äôs alternative parenting approaches, Shane making sexually charged comments about Willow who was 11 at the time is not excused."
11329,2020-06-28 15:54:25,hh5z3u,"Jada and Will are far from model people or parents. I never know why they are referred to as #goals, but same with the Kardashians, money affords you a status with some people, regardless of how crappy they are."
11330,2020-06-28 12:05:17,hh5z3u,It‚Äôs crazy. To think that three people in the entertainment industry would be news worthy in a sub about the entertainment industry.

11337,2020-06-28 13:13:21,hh5z3u,The past scandal before this one was where he admitted on a radio interview that he used to hump his cat...............some people claimed it was fake. He said it was ‚Äúshock value jokes‚Äù like he did with this scandal. He also claimed it was a joke taken out of context. But yea I think someone even petitioned to take his pets away from him (don‚Äôt know about the last bit so don‚Äôt quote me on that)

11340,2020-06-28 16:04:59,hh5z3u,She put out a video bringing up several videos that have been brought back up on Twitter that have been privated for a while. Then she talked about several videos that make her uncomfortable now because they can be offensive and how she has privated them too. She obviously is super embarrassed and upset about what she‚Äôs done in the past and is still considering if she will ever make content for that channel(her main channel) again.
11341,2020-07-02 15:02:39,hh5z3u,I think you're referring to her blackface video which was removed and an apology video posted

Fame and fortune are the two most destructive things you can give a child. And to think that people in the world aren‚Äôt scum enough to do stuff like this, it‚Äôs absolutely foolish.

I don‚Äôt even post pictures of my kids on social media because I don‚Äôt want fuckin creeps creeping on them like this Dawson guy did to exactly prove my point. Who is at fault in this situation? The creep for being a creep because he *is* a creep, or the parents who put their child up on a public pedestal for the world to gaze at?"

11358,2020-06-28 19:44:58,hh5z3u,"Mm, his conspiracy videos were fun. But I never watched his older stuff (where he did all this disgusting jokes & stuff)

I find it hypocritical that the fans who want the ‚Äúold Shane‚Äù and who ‚Äúused to be fans‚Äù and ‚Äúgrew up with him‚Äù are now cancelling him because the shit they liked back then is what‚Äôs getting him in hot water now. Like... I don‚Äôt get it. He hasn‚Äôt done shocking jokes or blackface in years, so the ‚Äúold Shane‚Äù they liked has to be the racist Shane... So they enjoyed it then and he blew up big on the platform because of those nasty videos/podcast but now that he‚Äôs moved on to makeup & documentaries,NOW they have a problem?

I get that the catalyst is his possible involvement with the James Charles fiasco (last year a few YTers said that 19yr old James Charles was a predator to straight men.

It s only here cause they are some kind of celebrities it does not reflect the industry how do you not understand that ?
11377,2020-06-28 13:00:23,hh5z3u,I feel I ve been dragged away from my original comment discussing weather these guys work in the entertainment industry when I was pointing out that what is going on in there has nothing to do with the entertainment industry
11378,2020-06-28 16:20:08,hh5z3u,"Okay, I can respect that. Well said. I guess I‚Äôm just pointing out that it‚Äôs a sick world, and I as a parent, understanding that it can be a sick world, choose to take precautions and would never allow my 11-year-old to be in the same public spotlight as myself in the first place. As a parent, it‚Äôs hard not to blame yourself when stuff like this happens and child celebrities have to go through this shit on a daily basis."

11387,2020-06-28 14:01:03,hh5z3u,That would be something I would happily discuss. I don‚Äôt think an industry revolves largely about the personal life of its active members. Most the posts on this subs are about new movies or new filming techniques and such. I m guessing from your name your work or are involved with graphics and visual effects and to me your contribution to the industry would be greater than the personal life of celebrities
11388,2020-06-28 13:24:54,hh5z3u,But when and where did I argue with that? A lot of platforms or even social medias belong to that industry of course I agree with you I m just pointing this article is about child abuse it s a lot bigger than just these guys‚Äô jobs and therefore has little to do with this sub
11389,2020-06-28 22:42:51,hh5z3u,"O.... K... You realize just saying absurd things isn't humor. Creating a joke is a building of tension and then popping that tension with the punchline. Saying absurdities isn't humor, it's just saying absurd things that may get a laugh but not like a joke would.

Behold a master! Like Dave Chappelle does a great bit how he comes up with a punch line and then creates a joke around it. ""[Kick her in the pussy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHkHw-NQ5Wk)"" is an absurd statement but only funny within the context of what he is discussing. He just doesn't get on stage and say ""Kick her in the pussy"" and expect a laugh. There is a setup and pay off, saying ""Humping my cat"" is just an absurd statement, not a joke. NO different than the stupid ""Scary Movies"" spoofy movies just spit firing shit like ""Lawl so random!""

Wish people would stop using ""jokes""as an adamantium shield against being unfunny edgelords."
11390,2020-06-28 22:46:41,hh5z3u,"I never said it was funny, or that it was a successful joke. Have you listened to the podcast? It was clear he was trying to be humorous, and he wasn‚Äôt successful.

I don‚Äôt claim to be an expert on joke structure but I can recognize when someone is trying to make a joke. He was clearly trying to be edgy, and I don‚Äôt believe for a second that he actually jerked off onto his cat. If you do then you‚Äôre a moron."
11391,2020-06-28 22:51:42,hh5z3u,">I never said it was funny, or that it was a successful joke

That much is clear. I asked you what made it a joke, you said it's absurdity. I responded that just saying absurdities isn't humor, it's not a joke. It's an absurd statement, like you and him admitted, meant to be edgey, not a joke."
11392,2020-06-28 22:55:21,hh5z3u,Okay so you‚Äôre going to be that pedantic? An absurd statement said for intended humorous effect doesn‚Äôt count as a joke? Fuck off.

11396,2020-06-28 02:05:41,hh5kfc,"Answer: 1.) In one of his podcasts he talks about humping his cat's belly.

2.) He has done numerous videos with blackface on portraying a black woman stereotype. Dark-toned foundation, black curly hair wigs, bright colored makeup, and a heavy ebonics accent. He has also done a latino woman stereotype where she had a lot of kids, always yelled at them and never cared for them, and did heavy makeup with a dark-toned foundation on.

3.) He filmed a video where he's standing next to a billboard/ad with Willow Smith on it when she was a little child, pretending to masturbate to it and turning around to look at the camera and ""get caught.""

4.) He's friends with Jeffree Star, whom he recently collaborated with for a makeup line. Star has a known racist past."

Shane Dawson has made a lot of ‚Äúshock videos‚Äù on his time on the internet including talking about sexual topics to young girls (including willow smith), describing a rather violent daydream about harming someone That had criticized him, joking about coming on his cat, & blackface. He‚Äôs also friends with Jeffree Star (who is quite controversial) and other people deemed ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù. Two years ago he made a docuseries about Jeffree Star. This then led to a makeup collaboration last year with Jeffree Star and another series about making a eyeshadow palette/ merchandise/ lipstick/etc.  he recently posted a goodbye message on Twitter about leaving the beauty community and in the process called everyone dramatic and also said James Charles (a make up youtuber that was in drama last year) needed a slice of humble pie. This ‚Äúgoodbye‚Äù to a community he was never really apart of has led to his past actions being brought into the limelight.

11400,2020-06-28 03:30:10,hh5kfc,"Answer: Shane Dawson got famous for making dark shock humor sketch videos and parodies from 2008 to like 2015, on his ShaneDawsonTV channel (that were pushing the envelope at the time and definitely would not be something a Youtuber could make money on today) and then started only posting vlogs on his ""iphone channel"" called ""shane"", which is where a lot of normies who watch him today discovered him, not knowing he got famous for making actual content and just thinking he was some random gay person who makes vlogs about makeup and conspiracy theories.

The reason he did humor about black people a lot was because he grew up in a black neighborhood and had a lot of black friends.

Normies find out about his actual videos which were always offensive and have a hissy fit because he isn't who they thought he was.

Basically the equivalent of screaming at any other form of offensive comedy like South Park.

EDIT: Don't know why I'm getting downvoted. Because I used the word ""normies""? There really isn't another word to describe them."
11401,2020-06-28 04:59:22,hh5kfc,"Maybe I'm just not into YouTube anymore but I remember watching Shane Dawson when I was in middle/high school. So I'm sure his content had changed but...

A beauty guru? Who would even believe that...? 

I remember him talking about a meet up with fans and the recording of one of his fans chewing a piece of gum, then he chewed that piece of gum and then gave it back. 14 year old me found it funny, 23 year old me cringes hard. Its painfully obvious he just knows how to play the game, I dont see how he would be invested in anything like that."
11402,2020-06-28 03:34:32,hh5kfc,"To add on, he has apologized for some of this stuff before. But the internet keeps dredging it up every now and then, like him humping his cat. 

It's definitely one of those things he will have to deal with for the rest of his life."
11403,2020-06-28 02:09:55,hh5kfc,"Follow-up questions: 

a) How long ago did these incidents take place? 

b) I've seen talk on Twitter that he's also engaged in sexual harassment. However, I am unsure if this is true or not (haven't seen any direct accusations, etc). Can you speak as to whether or not this is true?"
11404,2020-06-28 05:56:30,hh5kfc,"There's no way the cat thing was serious, if he actually did that he'd keep it secret and not openly joke about it. I don't think it's funny at all and there's probably a grain of truth greatly exaggerated for comedic effect but no way is that story close to something he actually did.

Keep in mind i'm not a fan of his so it's not like I have reason to come up with excuses to defend him, it's just that's a terrible thing to accuse him of and clearly not true."
11405,2020-06-28 06:18:29,hh5kfc,Why was this person ever popular??? I just don‚Äôt see the appeal.
11406,2020-06-28 03:25:53,hh5kfc,The cat thing keeps coming up for some reason. It's been dealt with multiple times but people keep bringing it back up. People don't like him and they try and get him canceled like once a year.
11407,2020-06-28 05:48:06,hh5kfc,But what caused people to start caring about this now? Was it because other youtubers started apologizing? Did one of those other videos recently go viral again?
11408,2020-06-28 04:04:39,hh5kfc,"Answer: It's because the literal first rule for the sub is ""be unbiased"" and your comment is dripping with bias"
11409,2020-06-28 06:07:34,hh5kfc,"I think people are mislead with the ""cat"" and ""baby"" controversies to cover up the vile videos he has actually done - especially sexualizing minors like his 12 yr old cousin and Willow Smith."
11410,2020-06-28 06:40:18,hh5kfc,... but do they call me Shane Dawson the bridge builder?  No!
11411,2020-06-28 02:13:47,hh5kfc,"Most of the blackface videos took place around 2010-2011, and I *think* the podcast with the cat incident was four years ago but don't quote me. I know most of these things from being subscribed to another subreddit that talked about him a lot due to his collab with Star but I had to dig to find out the dates. I can't confirm now because he deleted every single video on his main YouTube channel. 

I haven't seen or heard of any sexual allegations so that may or may not be true.

Edit: I did go on twitter and find a tweet showing a podcast where he tries to ""justify pedophilia.""

https://twitter.com/venus_aus/status/1274864806990761985?s=19"
11412,2020-06-28 04:06:36,hh5kfc,"Uh no, I'm just talking from experience. I was a fan of ShaneDawsonTV when I was like 12 years old in 2011."
11413,2020-06-28 02:23:46,hh5kfc,"It sounds like rn there‚Äôs a major cancel wave going through YouTube. Jenna Marbles just quit and honestly her content has been totally chill for like 7-8 years. I know she did some racist stuff but I have to say I believed her when she said she changed.

I know next to nothing about Dawson, but unless he has done more recent shitty stuff, I‚Äôm thinking being canceled is over the top. But, I do know he only recently tried to cut ties with Starr who is utter garbage so I‚Äôm thinking he probs was trying to dodge the coming cancel wave."
11414,2020-06-28 02:28:01,hh5kfc,"If you have a Twitter you should check out some of the tweets about him. He's being cancelled because of his unapologetic friendship with Jeffree Star, who is known to be a bad person in almost every aspect you can think of. He's a whole other mess of research to read about.

Also, Jenna Marbles apologized for her offensive videos without being asked to because she genuinely feels bad about them. She has also talked about not feeling YouTube as much as she used to in her podcasts with her boyfriend so it could have also been a way for her to quit."
11415,2020-06-28 02:59:48,hh5kfc,"There has been more recent shitty stuff, a lot of which has to do with a potential part he and Jeffree Star played in the whole ""Bye Sisters"" scandal (or Dramageddon, whichever you prefer). It seems like a lot of people are starting to put patterns together of his behavior that has very much been overlooked. He has a multi year history of problematic content on youtube, much of which has been recently purged, and a lot of people came (or still come) to his defense based on his newer ""persona"" being a completely different person. However, this recent tweet where he constantly defends Jeffree for the exact same things he says James Charles needed to grow out of (this was one of the main points of the ""Bye Sisters"" scandal, at the time Jeffree and Shane were both and their 30s and James was 19. There is a lot to unpack there, especially since they are asking for a pass for things they said when they were young and stupid but will not give the same concessions to James) seems to be the straw that broke the camel's back for many, myself included. He consistently surrounds himself with deeply problematic people and chooses to use his platform to help them clear up their image publicly (see his Tana and Jake Paul series). He puts on this persona of being poor and relatable while living in a huge mansion in Calabasas and it comes off as disingenuous. So there wasn't really one very problematic thing recently but more of a revealing of lots of problematic things that people have given him a pass for. He has apologized for parts of these things but his image in the youtube community is definitely shifting."
11416,2020-06-28 03:09:31,hh5kfc,"I know very little about both Dawson and Jenna, but my ex watched videos of both for years so I saw/heard a fair bit. Jenna was fine, but Shane always rubbed me the wrong way. It sucks that Jenna had to end things this way, she didn't even monetize her channel. She just kept doing it because she enjoyed it."
11417,2020-06-28 06:20:29,hh5kfc,This reads like the script for a TV show about high school drama that is targeted at elementary school kids.
11418,2020-06-28 04:05:20,hh5kfc,"My thoughts exactly! She and her boyfriend clearly are in love, adore their dogs, and love making silly and cute videos with the dogs. It felt super inoffensive. It‚Äôs hard to not see that she actually changed her content a lot to be very inclusive and wholesome"
11419,2020-06-28 05:00:59,hh5kfc,"Honestly, Jenna's recent content felt to me like her heart wasn't in the channel anymore. I think she already wanted to step back."
11420,2020-06-28 06:32:35,hh5kfc,"Honestly, I'm not sure how many people were even trying to call her out before her decision to step back from YouTube. It seemed to me more like she felt genuinely uncomfortable about her early work, and just wasn't having as much fun making YouTube content anymore."
11421,2020-06-28 06:28:23,hh5kfc,"Yeah, I really didn't see much 'cancel' type pressure on her leading up to the video where she stepped back from YouTube. It seemed more like she was genuinely uncomfortable about some of her early content, and just wasn't having fun making videos anymore."
11422,2020-06-28 06:29:24,hh5kfc,"I couldn't agree more tbh. I think she was tired and cancelled herself, and I don't blame her. Some of her old videos were not great, and that level of fame on Youtube for that many years has to be draining. She has her money, her dogs, and her boyfriend - she doesn't need to keep doing something that she doesn't feel good about."
11423,2020-06-27 22:36:24,hh30p6,Shane is absolutely disgusting.  Each day I learn something even more revolting that he did than the day before.  When can we all agree to fully cancel him and move on so we don‚Äôt have to hear about him anymore?
11424,2020-06-27 22:43:10,hh30p6,"i was such a fan (for years) and all of this is just so upsetting to realize. like after seeing the videos and past tweets and past behavior and how some of it would either go over my head (too young to realize), i didn't remember/see them, or i believed the apologies. i just feel like a part of my childhood is now more sinister than i realized.

And seeing his name trending for the past week, and it gets darker and darker, and i feel so...idk if i can pinpoint the exact emotion i feel."

11435,2020-06-27 22:12:11,hh1ytp,"All this happening only a week after he said James deserved a slice of humble pie might make me a believer in karma. 

I have a ton of empathy for most people that get the internet mob going after them for something they did in the past. But I have zero empathy for Shane. He's shown time and time again who he is. It is not his past, it is *him*. This is who he is. I don't even like James Charles but for Shane to first be complicit in the shitshow last year and defend it only a week ago saying James deserved it, makes me kinda happy that Shane will experience it as well. Pedo ""jokes"" are a million times worse than James not supporting hair supplements or whatever the fuck. And he deserves a million times more backlash than James got.

11440,2020-06-28 01:18:14,hh1ytp,"Also, Cupcakke  tweeted about not supporting Shane anymore. They were friends and they did a video together. Shane is a deep hole career wise and I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll be able to dig himself out of."
11441,2020-06-28 00:29:59,hh1ytp,Oooooooh shit. He is FUCKED. RIP. üíÄ
11442,2020-06-28 05:16:21,hh1ytp,"Over the past few years, Shane and Ryland have been talking about wanting to adopt a child and if this is who Shane really is that does NOT need to happen."

11445,2020-06-28 03:06:02,hh1ytp,Man I‚Äôd love to be a fly on the wall in the Smith household.  I have a feeling Will is going to personally end his career.
11446,2020-06-27 22:17:57,hh1ytp,"Oh wow. It was only a matter of time I feel. That twitter notes app rant may end up being one of the biggest regrets of his life, I wonder if any of this would‚Äôve happened without that (which is another discussion tbh)."
11447,2020-06-28 05:13:40,hh1ytp,"Even if what he did can't be punishable by law, it will certainly affect him and Ryland if they were ever to consider adopting a child in the future."

11454,2020-06-27 23:21:19,hh1ytp,Good. It's extremely messed up and Jaden has every right to call him out.
11455,2020-06-27 23:10:15,hh1ytp,Ooof... this is gonna be bigger than we thought
11456,2020-06-27 22:58:51,hh1ytp,"I'm super out of the loop, what did he say about Willow?"
11457,2020-06-27 21:38:57,hh1ytp,as he should
11458,2020-06-27 23:03:23,hh1ytp,He‚Äôs done hopefully. I hope Will and Jada destroy him
11459,2020-06-27 22:57:17,hh1ytp,Can someone catch me up? I've been at work/without a phone this whole time and have no idea what these tweets are about??
11460,2020-06-27 23:52:47,hh1ytp,"i feel like this drags attention away from how jeffree is also a pedophile and rapist . sort of a conspiracy but i feel like jeffree might have paid someone to start ‚Äúthe shane is a pedo‚Äù wave to take backlash from him, because honestly this could have been jeffree if it wasnt for the videos coming up

edit: check out liam mccoy‚Äôs video. one of jeffrees old friends wrote a book which included an experience of jeffree attempting to rape him with a butcher knife. of course, the book is taken of all digital and physical shelves. also jeffree never talked about any claims of him being a pedo and attempting to rape someone. plus with his old friends being a pedo and now possibly shane, remember‚Äúbirds of a feather, flock together‚Äù"
11461,2020-06-28 02:54:32,hh1ytp,"I‚Äôm not defending Shane, he fully deserves the shit storm that is falling upon him.

However, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs racist. He‚Äôs just incredibly fucking stupid and did ANYTHING to get views and grow his channel. Now it‚Äôs all coming back to bit him in the ass. Good riddance."

11464,2020-06-27 22:58:45,hh1ytp,The thought of Shane at home bawling his eyes out as his world crumbles is satisfying.

11466,2020-06-27 22:14:20,hh1ytp,Welp.

11472,2020-06-28 05:32:52,hh1ytp,Damn... I had no idea about him jackin off to a poster of her...
11473,2020-06-28 00:19:23,hh1ytp,SOMEONE FILL ME IN WHAT HAPPENED
11474,2020-06-28 01:40:32,hh1ytp,Oof
11475,2020-06-28 04:52:19,hh1ytp,The first time i see that video all i can think was how their family would feel. It‚Äôs disgusting and i see many comments supporting Shane under her Jada‚Äôs tweet.
11476,2020-06-28 08:27:55,hh1ytp,I'm out of the loop. Can anyone tell me what actually happened?
11477,2020-06-28 13:13:38,hh1ytp,Its nearly at 1m likes...
11478,2020-06-28 14:24:55,hh1ytp,what the hell happened
11479,2020-06-28 20:33:04,hh1ytp,I am confused can someone explain this to me please
11480,2020-06-30 20:02:12,hh1ytp,"I used to love Shane‚Äôs videos, especially his old edgy ones which I watched when I was in middle school. Looking back though... man he went to far a lot. Do I think they were just jokes? Yes. But he should have never done this stuff. I cant believe I didnt notice anything wrong with that Willow ‚Äújoke‚Äù originally, but I guess it was because I was so young."
11481,2020-07-07 00:27:51,hh1ytp,I wish he could write a bit better though.
11482,2020-07-23 02:51:13,hh1ytp,Jaden Smith looks like he was put in a microwave.
11483,2020-06-28 07:38:06,hh1ytp,I think shane needs to open his purse
11484,2020-06-28 09:13:09,hh1ytp,Ok i thought he should be forgiven when he apologised but HELL NO. This shit is unforgivable...
11485,2020-06-28 04:35:38,hh1ytp,"I just dont get why they waited 10years to address it, like if they were so disgusted why wait until the cancel campaign had already started on Shane? lol like they have enough clout they could have started this along time ago. Just seems sketchy to me to jump on the bandwagon when they coulda started it long agooo."

11489,2020-06-28 07:14:05,hh1ytp,"yeah like 10 years ago.
Jeez. prisoners are earlier free from their crimes."
11490,2020-06-28 02:22:09,hh1ytp,Shane also said Willow is a robot and Jada plugs her in at night...I agree with Shane.
11491,2020-06-28 03:14:44,hh1ytp,Untalented Jaden Smith who should have never been let on the Coachella stage.
11492,2020-06-27 22:43:54,hh1ytp,"Oh he is. His movie is fucked, his youtube is fucked, his fiance is fucked. His past self has fucked him over"
11493,2020-06-28 02:12:20,hh1ytp,I'm just disappointed that jeffree is not getting more heat from his own pedophila support (shane and dahvie something) as well as his other actions
11494,2020-06-27 23:38:58,hh1ytp,"When I was young, I used to watch the Shanaynay videos. While I didn‚Äôt understand it at the time, and he didn‚Äôt do something as awful as blackface I know feel like they‚Äôre problematic.

11496,2020-06-28 02:07:55,hh1ytp,Jeffree needs to go down with him and then I'll believe karma exists. He's been hella predatory as well.
11497,2020-06-28 03:01:03,hh1ytp,"As someone who stopped being a fan of Shane a while ago I gotta say seeing him get this is a bit funny as well as vindictating

Granted if I'm honest I think in a months time this will be forgotten most of his fans I feel don't care and if there are worse people om youtube who can survive this so can shane

Honestly I'm not even sure what the correct consequences for all of his behaviour since he clearly hasn't changed much over the years"

11502,2020-06-28 02:20:12,hh1ytp,tbf I was confused too and had to read a bit on Twitter
11503,2020-06-27 23:19:46,hh1ytp,Jaden also tweeted about Shane Dawson doing blackface on the regular. I wonder how he would feel about Shane Dawson doing black face as Will Smith.
11504,2020-06-27 22:35:03,hh1ytp,What video?
11505,2020-06-28 11:57:35,hh1ytp,Link?
11506,2020-06-30 20:09:39,hh1ytp,"It‚Äôs funny how I never knew Shane was *this* bad. Like I always knew he was problematic, but after searching his name on Twitter and watching all the videos, like this one, pop up.... yikes.

11510,2020-06-28 10:12:03,hh1ytp,Weren't they going to use Morgan as a surrogate? It kind of disgusted me how they acted entitled to her body
11511,2020-06-28 13:12:15,hh1ytp,He is not fit to take care of a child.
11512,2020-06-27 23:04:44,hh1ytp,He will blame it on his childhood once again or maybe he‚Äôll add some spice and say it was his anxiety

11516,2020-06-28 08:17:40,hh1ytp,"I just wonder how Ryland feels about all this in general? Allegedly, his sister is upset with Jeffree so that doesn‚Äôt bode well already, so the concept that Shane just destroyed any chance at them adopting kids probably doesn‚Äôt make things easier"

11518,2020-06-28 01:14:40,hh1ytp,I‚Äôm pretty sure Jaden is very active on Twitter so eventually the tweets got to him and then Jada. I wouldn‚Äôt put it past J* though....hope he goes down this sinking ship as well!

11521,2020-06-28 07:27:27,hh1ytp,I only knew about Shanaynay which is why I followed him anyway for a while. Noooo clue about blackface and pedophilia jokes etc until this past week.
11522,2020-06-28 07:35:39,hh1ytp,"He‚Äôs been getting exposed for his past videos every few months for the last couple years. I watched him as a teen and that‚Äôs how YouTube content used to be. Not really defending him, but he just did what was popular and added layers of edgyness"
11523,2020-06-27 23:00:59,hh1ytp,he pretended to jerk off to a poster of her when she was 11 i believe

11527,2020-06-28 03:05:02,hh1ytp,Anyone sorta wish Jeff was also getting this level of backlash how does he keep avoiding all the hate
11528,2020-06-28 00:00:46,hh1ytp,I feel like Shane started the ‚Äúshane is a pedo‚Äù wave all by himself
11529,2020-06-28 07:01:43,hh1ytp,"How is Jeffrey a pedo and a rapist?

Edit: K just downvote me then. I'm just asking cause ive never heard of Jeffrey being a pedo or a rapist."
11530,2020-06-28 05:10:08,hh1ytp,One argument I hate that‚Äôs used to defend Shane is the ‚ÄúHe was young and it was a long time ago.‚Äù Dude was in his 20s. He was an adult. I never would have even thought to do something like blackface even when I was an edgy teen.
11531,2020-06-28 03:06:04,hh1ytp,"He might not be racist but he sure is OK doing racist things multiple times and hanging out with racists

That aside I don't think this is about his racism"
11532,2020-06-28 07:01:01,hh1ytp,Yeah he's not racist.
11533,2020-06-28 05:38:13,hh1ytp,"Doing black face makes you racist. There‚Äôs no ifs ands or buts about that. I don‚Äôt think Shane hates black people, but that isn‚Äôt the only thing that makes someone racist. Anyone who does black face is a racist."
11534,2020-06-28 01:39:44,hh1ytp,There‚Äôs a video of him pretending to jerk off to a poster of Willow Smith when she was 11

Specifically, the blatant pedophilia and bestiality jokes. Person went to twitter and did a thread on all the things he's said and done concerning those jokes, along with how serious they were. One of the videos that surface was him fake-jerking himself PUBLICLY to a poster of Willow Smith. It became viral and it got to the Smiths, which have every right to be fucking pissed, so they addressed him publicly about it. Calling him out and rightfully not accepting his apology."
11539,2020-06-28 06:41:11,hh1ytp,They didn‚Äôt know. I have watched shane since his food videos and had never seen any of his pedophilic videos
11540,2020-06-28 07:26:01,hh1ytp,Shane is *YouTube* famous. 90% of the people I know in real life don‚Äôt even know who he is and you expect Hollywood to know?
11541,2020-06-28 06:42:34,hh1ytp,What does that have to do with pedophilia?

I‚Äôm now wondering if Jada will do a table talk about this..."
11549,2020-06-28 01:10:01,hh1ytp,"Shane Dawson really murdered his own career, yikes. I think it‚Äôs for sure warranted BUT I really hope Jafar goes down with him. That man is a plague who should‚Äôve stayed in the MySpace era."
11550,2020-06-28 01:31:38,hh1ytp,Good thing he‚Äôs got a few mil he can happily retire on.
11551,2020-06-28 09:32:55,hh1ytp,"If this is true, how is he going to be fucked? Will people stop watching? Because this stuff isn‚Äôt new. Clips of shane coming out and saying, let‚Äôs say stuff on the podcast about finding kids ‚Äúsexy‚Äù and then he came out and apologised. 

I mean, I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of him but part of me has a hard time believing he‚Äôs ‚Äúover‚Äù because we‚Äôve seen backlash against him, and then he‚Äôs fine."
11552,2020-06-27 23:22:43,hh1ytp,what sort of movie was he doing?
11553,2020-06-30 20:04:00,hh1ytp,"I feel like this is only affecting him this bad because he has dissavowed this stuff and moved to a more mainstream audience. Like if he was still an over the top edgy commedian and rolled with that, he probably would be ok. I mean people like iDubzz get away with this type of stuff everyday."
11554,2020-07-09 18:02:26,hh1ytp,wait he's gay right?
11555,2020-06-28 06:02:01,hh1ytp,"It really isn't that major honestly, people are blowing this out of proportion."
11556,2020-06-28 07:22:09,hh1ytp,"Oh don‚Äôt worry, there‚Äôs a highly anticipated Blair white video coming tomorrow. Hold your beer!"
11557,2020-06-28 05:06:12,hh1ytp,"I think that a lot of us who watched him when we were younger didn't realize it was wrong because well.. we were children and as a child, you don't always know what is right and what is wrong so you just accept what you are shown."
11558,2020-06-28 02:12:55,hh1ytp,He is the worst. That haircut he had was awful too
11559,2020-06-28 05:16:38,hh1ytp,"Just rewatched this particular video. While some of the videos he made in the past aged very poorly (blackface, racial slurs, etc.), I don‚Äôt think this is one of them. I‚Äôm curious what you find problematic about this one."
11560,2020-06-28 01:34:02,hh1ytp,"Nah, I think he‚Äôll stay, they‚Äôll get married. He‚Äôll realise he deserves better, take half the money and sail off, also that way people won‚Äôt be like ‚ÄúsEe I kNeW hE wAs A gOlDdIgGeR‚Äù"
11561,2020-06-28 01:03:37,hh1ytp,"Shitty opinion but I always saw him as a gold digger(just watch his light up when Jeff got him stuff) and with Shane‚Äôs income only gonna be his  pallet, I see him leaving"

11564,2020-06-28 04:16:34,hh1ytp,"Yep, the only thing more satisfying than Shane being destroyed by one of Hollywood‚Äôs most powerful families..... is if something similar were to occur to Jeffree. It would be the ultimate *chefs kiss*. I would never chefs kiss again after that."
11565,2020-06-27 22:05:23,hh1ytp,Shane Dawson said he got his cousins mother's consent for those creepy videos but he sure as hell didn't get Willow's mothers consent to make creepy remarks about HER child
11566,2020-06-28 02:04:16,hh1ytp,"Yeah this is bad. Very, very, un-fixable level of bad."
11567,2020-06-28 00:16:10,hh1ytp,"Basically, he said there‚Äôs a video of him fake mastrubating to Willow Smith and he thinks it‚Äôs super funny"

11569,2020-06-28 09:52:27,hh1ytp,Is he dark humor type youtuber?
11570,2020-06-28 04:52:34,hh1ytp,Wow this is an actual video
11571,2020-06-27 22:45:27,hh1ytp,The one where Shane sings the Fresh Prince theme song with a brown face üíÄ
11572,2020-06-27 23:23:10,hh1ytp,https://youtu.be/OS2PzF7CDRE
11573,2020-06-28 05:45:42,hh1ytp,That list just means that he was in his contact list. It does not confirm any act of pedophilia.
11574,2020-06-28 02:05:10,hh1ytp,damn. I almost forgot he did that
11575,2020-06-28 10:42:18,hh1ytp,"I'm pretty sure that was all just jokes. Most doctors want a surrogate who's given  birth already, so they know what they're getting into and so if anything goes wrong they dont get deprived of having their own kids. Morgans not an option cause of that, plus like pretty sure she just wouldnt want to."
11576,2020-06-27 23:50:37,hh1ytp,That‚Äôs exactlyyy what he did in his ‚Äúapology‚Äù video
11577,2020-06-28 06:05:24,hh1ytp,"No its not. He has no business adopting children if he has a history of sexualizing them.

Adoption should always be about what is best for the child. Children deserve what is best for them, and what's best for a child is never to be placed with someone known for sexualizing kids.

I say this as a birthmother.

Edit: I just watched more of the videos. He's a pedophile. He needs to be far away from ALL children."
11578,2020-06-28 08:47:51,hh1ytp,"Yeah. I don't think that people understand that culture changes and back then, edgy ruled. What was okay then does not mean it's okay now but people should not be cancelled over old videos like that. Now, this video is much worse as it's not even much of a joke really. It's just kinda gross."
11579,2020-06-27 23:01:45,hh1ytp,Big yikes
11580,2020-06-28 03:04:26,hh1ytp,"And people really be out here saying its no big deal its just a joke get over it

Children should not be sexualised this shouldn't be up for debate"
11581,2020-06-27 23:23:56,hh1ytp,"Jesus I leave the internet for five minutes and more happens,  just gonna sit here and wait to see what he says"
11582,2020-06-28 05:46:46,hh1ytp,"Oh 100%. Like, Shane definitely deserves the level of backlash he‚Äôs getting, but Jeffree deserves even more after everything he‚Äôs done."
11583,2020-06-28 00:13:06,hh1ytp,I feel like Shane is a pedo
11584,2020-06-28 15:36:17,hh1ytp,"Idk about the rapist shit but he is best friends with 3 known pedos including Shane, and I think it was a few months ago it was revealed he knowingly introduced young girls to a pedo who ended up violating them, then turned around and lied about ""never knowing he was a pedo"" when he was obviously a pedo. I don't have links but I'm sure googling will turn up answers. I'd do it myself but I got an iPhone for the first time and I don't know how this thing works yet lol"
11585,2020-06-28 06:54:59,hh1ytp,I was just going to type that! Even when I was a dumb teen I never even thought to do that type of shit. And the pedophilia jokes? No. Fuck no. He's a sick fuck.
11586,2020-06-28 06:03:50,hh1ytp,"I did some unbelievably retarded shit in my twenties that I‚Äôm grateful I didn‚Äôt upload to the internets, but nothing involved pedophilia or blackface. Shane doesn‚Äôt deserve a platform and should just fuck off and enjoy his early retirement."
11587,2020-06-28 03:14:07,hh1ytp,"It is when you talk about his blackface character ‚ÄúShanaynay‚Äù and the Hispanic one ‚ÄúGuadalupe‚Äù.

You can get some cheap laughs and profit from stereotypes of marginalized groups of people and that‚Äôs exactly what he did. I personally, as an Afro-Latina, don‚Äôt think he hates blacks or Hispanics. He‚Äôs just dumb as fuck and uploaded to YouTube the cringiest, most inappropriate things he ever thought of. 

I‚Äôm not a fan of his content (conspiracy, the secret life of ‚Äúinsert turd‚Äù, etc) or his god awful makeup line with Jafar Starshit.

Hell, I‚Äôd go as far I‚Äôm saying this scandal is god sent as it‚Äôll hopefully make him delete his channels and fuck off from YouTube."
11588,2020-06-28 01:41:00,hh1ytp,What the fuck? I‚Äôve been supporting someone who did THAT!? Well not anymore at least...
11589,2020-06-28 02:09:25,hh1ytp,Cancel culture doesn't apply to people who do genuinely f*cked things in their 20s. It called not supporting a gross human being.
11590,2020-06-28 00:30:34,hh1ytp,"Nah. Fucking making pedophilic comments, even joking about it and jerking off to a child's poster is even more toxic. Stopped trying to defend the undefendable."
11591,2020-06-28 00:51:53,hh1ytp,It‚Äôs not cancel culture. It‚Äôs holding people accountable for the pain they‚Äôve caused others.
11592,2020-06-28 00:54:11,hh1ytp,"So we shouldn't call out pedophile behavior? This isn't some ""haha black people love watermelons"" tweet resurfacing 10 years later, this is him pretending to jack off to an ELEVEN YEAR OLD girl. There's nothing toxic going on here."
11593,2020-06-28 01:15:31,hh1ytp,Complete schadenfreude.
11594,2020-06-28 03:44:35,hh1ytp,There's a distinction between cancel culture and consequences.  I think we can all agree that this level of documented despicable behavior (for profit) has serious consequences and he deserves to face them.
11595,2020-06-28 04:37:46,hh1ytp,Not when it comes to pedophiles and racist. Specially an adult who stated that babies are sexy.
11596,2020-06-28 00:38:08,hh1ytp,Do you have a link to the twitter thread?
11597,2020-06-28 09:44:46,hh1ytp,"What does Shane making a joke (a non funny one) has to do with pedophilia ..

If y‚Äôall really are so anti pedo.. go protest against 69 or Nicki minaj... but nope Jayden doesn‚Äôt really care about any of that because double standard"
11598,2020-06-28 12:32:24,hh1ytp,"I'm not defending his actions. Oh no.
however I do have to take into context that this was very long ago that Shane used to portray a character that was overexcessive and 'said everything for shock value' and he apoligized for that longggg ago.
over and over again.

Why is this being brought up now again? Wasnt the point back then that context was very important?

However thats separate from other things that are going on especially since last years 'dramageddon'"
11599,2020-06-28 06:49:33,hh1ytp,[removed]
11600,2020-06-27 22:53:06,hh1ytp,Shane will be lucky if that‚Äôs all that happens. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this ends up in court
11601,2020-06-29 07:14:35,hh1ytp,"That honestly may be the only way he can redeem even part of his audience, if Jada allows him the opportunity to be on red table talk and absolutely grills him"
11602,2020-06-28 03:53:11,hh1ytp,Im sure she will.
11603,2020-06-28 09:39:22,hh1ytp,"It‚Äôs different this time, we‚Äôre in uncharted territory. Never before has something like this gone as mainstream as it has."
11604,2020-07-09 18:02:47,hh1ytp,It's too big. You see it now. Too big.
11605,2020-06-27 23:24:48,hh1ytp,"Basically a horror, but the only horror movie Shane knows of is Scream, so he was doing scream."
11606,2020-06-28 18:44:37,hh1ytp,"Just saw her video. Honestly, I don‚Äôt know which side she is on because the video is more of outing JC..."
11607,2020-06-30 20:06:28,hh1ytp,"I still dissavow the idea that Shane is actually a racist or a predator. He just has horrific judgement, and that continues to this day. Obviously not an excuse though."
11608,2020-06-29 03:01:43,hh1ytp,"there's no such thing as ""wrong"" jokes. that's what makes them jokes"
11609,2020-06-28 06:24:32,hh1ytp,uhhhhhhhhhhhh
11610,2020-06-28 12:00:52,hh1ytp,Same.
11611,2020-06-28 05:37:44,hh1ytp,"I don""t believe Shane will ever marry Ryland. As to Shane wondering why it was a crime to look at child porn, who the hell even asks that? Dawson is messed up. Nobody sane gets turned on by kids. Period.

Ryland is disciplined and talented doing the interior design. He can be forgiven for liking luxury. Dawson claims to be poor and that the deal with J* wasn't a cash grab but he drooled over the luxury pig logo stuff. Dawson pees on the beauty community and on his fans and calls it rain. Finally he gets called on it.
What has Dawson ever done to benefit people with mental illness or people struggling with weight disorders or anxiety and depression specifically? He has a weight coach he has a home gym Ryland could teach him yoga. He's lazy and blames it on his anxiety and treats the drugs he takes like a joke. With his hygiene alone I never understood how he made that into nothing.  He wants to help people without helping himself.
I recall that therapist who accompanied him to see Jake Paul. No licensed therapist would ever agree to observe a person without telling them. She could ruin her career that way. 
And no drama Dawson did that 'documentary' for drama because it sells. He benefited only himself.
He'll get out of this, sadly. That's the reality of it. And then he'll repeat his behavior and have to apologize again.
Dawson is very. very messed up. He's just making the apologies to save his career and his cash. Why do you think he deleted all the videos? 
Guilty as hell and J* owns him now."
11612,2020-06-29 09:13:38,hh1ytp,"I would like to think he leaves because he's doing the decent thing and not because the cupboard is empty. He isn't going empty handed if he does go. I think he's Shane's common law husband and he did look after him for a long time. It might even be possible to sue Shane for depriving him of his yt career. I'd get the best damn lawyer and claim half of what they owned.
But then again, Ryland could be as bad and be an enabler for Dawson's behavior. I hope this isn't what happens. I like Ryland and Morgan. Just for the record if Morgan was my daughter and people tried to force plastic surgery on her, those people would need emergency surgery after I got through with them. She's funny and pretty and I'd forgive her her failures in remaining upright. üòÄ  She seems to have survived her cat if not her roller skates üòÉ
The lie detector makes me not believe that he's a gold digger. He takes everything a lot more seriously. Than Shane.does.

[Gold digger?](https://youtu.be/JW5J4Dph1go)"
11613,2020-06-27 22:21:50,hh1ytp,"Regardless if he got his aunt‚Äôs consent to exploit her daughter, he still exploited a kid and shame on her mother honestly for allowing that behavior to take place."
11614,2020-06-28 01:12:45,hh1ytp,"I also saw a screenshot of a video from Shane giving a young boy a penis shaped cookie....probably got his mom‚Äôs permission but still very inappropriate. Tbh, dark humor shouldn‚Äôt include things with children ever."
11615,2020-06-28 03:37:37,hh1ytp,I wanna see those videos. What happened in them?
11616,2020-06-28 07:22:44,hh1ytp,Remarks? I'd say that video was more than remarks
11617,2020-06-28 11:30:54,hh1ytp,I don't know if it's really possible to describe twomad. You really just have to see for yourself.
11618,2020-06-27 22:47:31,hh1ytp,"Oh noooooooo

Edit: fuck that guyyyyyyy ugh"
11619,2020-06-28 04:11:53,hh1ytp,Don‚Äôt forget the multiple videos that exist of him using the N word.
11620,2020-06-28 06:15:48,hh1ytp,...I can't believe this exists.

11623,2020-06-28 00:30:01,hh1ytp,He made a video kinda addressing everything
11624,2020-06-28 17:46:43,hh1ytp,Nope I've tried to find anything about Jeffrey being a rapist or a pedo and I've found nothing. I get that he has associated with Dahvie Vanity in the past but that doesn't mean Jeffrey himself is a sexual predator. And its fucked up for people to throw out accusations like that like its nothing.
11625,2020-06-28 03:19:06,hh1ytp,"I mean this scandal involving lots of instances of sexualising children like the tweet inquestion it feels like you are avoiding it

Personally as a black man I don't think he hates Poc either even if he is friends with people that certainly do hate black people or at least are racist in some capacity e.g Jaffar which sorta means by extension he is OK being around racist ill let you decide what that makes him I know what I think

I don't doubt you can get cheap laughs and profit from stereotyping Im not sure anyone is doubting that but plenty of us just think it's shitty"
11626,2020-06-28 04:17:10,hh1ytp,"Yeah it's inexcusable. My name is Shane adjacent and plenty of people called me Shanaynay, Shaquanda, etc. There's no excuse to ""lean in"" to a ""joke"" like that. He needs to fuck off. I didn't know about his history until recently but his foray into the beauty world flagged him as a scammer for me. He had no business selling make-up. I'm glad his exploitative nature has caught up with him."
11627,2020-06-28 01:44:12,hh1ytp,"I‚Äôve been watching him since I was like 14, I‚Äôm 23 now and that video was basically the last straw, he doesn‚Äôt deserve the support or money he gets at this point. The way he behaves and tries to be relatable when he‚Äôs a millionaire makes me slightly mad too."

You‚Äôre so weird. Jayden has every right to be mad at a grown adult for pretending to madturbate to his 11 year old sister"
11631,2020-06-28 12:35:52,hh1ytp,"no one has to accept his apology, especially when he still associates with very bad people. willows family especially don‚Äôt need to accept his apology"
11632,2020-06-28 13:17:16,hh1ytp,"He's STILL overexcessive and says everything for shock value, he just shifted the focus from blackface/pedophilia jokes to jokes about weight issues, anxiety, pills, etc. He literally hasn't changed in a decade. Jokes like that prevent people from seeking help for their mental illnesses because of people like him making fun of the whole thing."
11633,2020-06-27 23:01:10,hh1ytp,Serious question - is what he did illegal?
11634,2020-06-28 03:38:04,hh1ytp,"In court for what?

Not defending him or what he did, but I'm not sure any part of it was really illegal."
11635,2020-06-28 19:34:51,hh1ytp,"Agreed. She has a shady past and is a great friend of Shane (which puts her in ‚Äòcamp‚Äô Shane&Jeffree) and since Dramageddon 2, I don‚Äôt believe anything without proof."
11636,2020-06-29 20:27:54,hh1ytp,"Joking about things that are damaging to children or minority groups is wrong.. Also a joke making light or condoning the abuse of children is, wrong.."
11637,2020-06-28 11:52:07,hh1ytp,What drugs does he take?
11638,2020-06-27 22:24:07,hh1ytp,"Yeah parental consent doesn‚Äôt really matter in cases like this, it only means the parents are awful too."
11639,2020-06-28 07:03:53,hh1ytp,"As a mother myself, there‚Äôs no chance on earth, in heaven or hell that I would consent such thing. What the hell is wrong with people?!

11642,2020-06-28 06:04:57,hh1ytp,"His phone? Ok I did some light Googling and I see one credible source where he was investigated by child protective services. So ok. Noted. But the link between him and Epstein isn't strong enough. Claiming that it is, is spreading misinformation.

Epstein was a powerful man that knew powerful people. Lots of famous people went to his island. But not all of them are pedophiles or even close. There's random ass people on that list too, like Naomi Campbell are you gonna tell me she's a pedophile too?"
11643,2020-06-28 06:40:01,hh1ytp,He didn‚Äôt address the videos. He addressed the jokes on the podcast https://twitter.com/sanderskennedy_/status/1276659872109678592?s=21
11644,2020-06-28 03:27:10,hh1ytp,"man I only watched a couple of his videos but I completely agree with you. stereotyping and all of those sexualizing kids thing is just so fucked up. I have a very hispanic name and I‚Äôve always hated it because it‚Äôs used in stereotype jokes and just makes me so insecure whenever I tell someone what my name is. I hope Shane‚Äôs career never recovers. imo he‚Äôs definitely an in closet racist white man, by publishing those videos, no matter how long ago he showed his true colors. he should‚Äôve never posted any of that, yet he did."
11645,2020-06-28 03:55:14,hh1ytp,"The video involving Willow Smith is nauseating. Like I said, fuck Shane Dawson and I hope he drops off the face of the earth. He‚Äôs aggressively unfunny and a terrible person. I really could not give a fuck about him."
11646,2020-06-28 03:03:24,hh1ytp,"I mean but some of the stuff isnt even a decade ago there is so much shitty things he ahs repeatedly done over years

I would agree with you if they were one or two time incidents he did as a kid and he had clearly changed as a person but that's the problem he hasn't changed as a person

I mean look at any of his most recent issues and tell me he is different"
11647,2020-06-28 01:19:32,hh1ytp,"I'm glad that we can both agreed on it. I apologize for thinking that you were actually giving him a pass on this issue. Many are using the whole 'cancel culture=toxic' narrative to deviate attention from this behavior. 

Do I agree with you on that observation? I definitely do. I think that if you're willing to weaponize your platforms for good (or bad), you have to uphold yourself to the same bar you uphold others. 

I could literally spent hours talking about online shaming and the effects of cancel culture - why to a degree it's necessary but also harmful. 

In the end, this all becomes an outlet for various groups to expel their frustrations, but does it work? That's gonna be something we'll have to see."
11648,2020-06-28 02:02:53,hh1ytp,I saw that and couldn‚Äôt sit through it all. I was like oh this is the worse it could get and it kept getting worse and worse. Argh disgusting

Plus there is audio evidence of him claiming to google ‚Äúnaked baby pics‚Äù. Combine it with the video itself and BOOM , unleash your inner lawsuit.

Maybe the smiths will sue him for defamation, like they could claim that since willow was a child, she was not sexually active and therefore shane defamed her for framing that she was?

Like idk, but it FEELS like what he did was illegal on some level"

11655,2020-06-28 12:58:47,hh1ytp,I believe Zanax which is for anxiety disorders. In some of his videos he mentions his pills. Zanax has a high probability of addiction. I don't know if that's what he still takes.
11656,2020-06-27 22:47:38,hh1ytp,"Now that I‚Äôm thinking about it, what he did is something that people typically do to groom a child and he could have groomed her mom I guess. It‚Äôs so disgusting. And that [twitter thread ](https://twitter.com/misshemlock/status/1276465876607229952)  showing all of the clips of him with young kids and how he‚Äôd speak to them just further supports the idea that he was grooming them."

11664,2020-06-28 13:18:19,hh1ytp,Does he seem like opiates?
11665,2020-06-27 23:27:40,hh1ytp,That thread is INSANE. What is even crazier is that he has gone this long and this hasnt hurt his career until now. There has literally never been a time in entertainment history where it has been funny to joke about pedophilia in the sense of calling babies sexy and googling naked babies. that is insane and I have no idea how with audio evidence he isnt in legal trouble.
11666,2020-06-28 12:36:18,hh1ytp,Epstein was apparently extremely into science and making friends with scientists IIRC. He would host these dinners and invite bunches of scientists and thinkers and have these intellectual discussions (I remember reading he didn‚Äôt contribute too much value to the conversation). So it totally tracks for someone like Hawking to come visit

Unless shane was claiming that lies were true, in a completely serious context, then it's not illegal. When we say it's free speech, we really mean that you can say pretty much whatever you want without going to jail or being fined. 

I dont see why you're taking my explanation of the 1st amendment in application as a nationalistic defence. It's literally how it works. I'm happy to talk about how evil american healthcare is. But that has nothing to do with you not understanding basic american legal concepts"

11677,2020-06-28 04:12:32,hh1ytp,I was talking to my sister today about how Shane TOTALLY deserves Onision treatment- he deserves to be obliterated off the face of YouTube to the shameful corners where only 10k losers still follow him. He does not deserve the level of progressive fame he has gotten. I hope this is truly his comeuppance- it‚Äôs everything he deserves. He and Onision are honestly one and same in my eyes

11680,2020-06-27 23:29:43,hh1ytp,"I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs legal ramifications as in being sued by the Smith family, or a jail type thing"
11681,2020-06-28 17:07:07,hh1ytp,"Yes, I know a person on yt that had to go to a clinic and be sedated to detox off of it.

I was on vicodin for about 4 years to treat pain, had to be monitored carefully had to do pee test any day I picked it up, had to be treated like I already was an addict. I hated it and one day asked my insignificant other üòÅ could I just quit, go cold turkey. She supported my decision. So the two of us went to a site where people were addicted and had been, and read what I would go through. I went through it for about a week but it took longer to feel like myself.
(and was bitched at for not going to a clinic but screw them for disbelieving me and humiliating me and tossing me into the group that abuses the drug)

Now I'm on tylenol with codeine for pain as needed. My shrink advised it. I'm just not an addictive type, and I never felt high on anything. I've seen far too much to want drugs but the pain to quote my shrink was affecting my quality of life.   

I don't know if Dawson is still taking. Zanax as needed but imo he jokes about his pills like it's a game to him. Anxiety is nothing to laugh about. People suffer so badly with it. In my case it comes out of nowhere.

I still feel as if Dawson is just angry that he had to apologize again. Sorry but if you admit you said and did racist shit and exhibited interest in pedophilia, you don't preface the apology with crap about your pain, and I was trying to be funny and edgy and woe is me. You admit it, say it was wrong and maybe give money to BLM and a children's charity. Donate masks and equipment for medical personnel. Something. All the people saying you fucked up MEANS you fucked up.
What's worse is all this emerges now, when we're making a bit of headway with educating people on racism and he could be a influencer that teaches teens about racism but he thinks it's edgy.
my wife just said that's YOU, not that cuckoo. Yeah.
The pandemic and the orange idiot has made everyone raw so it seems worse."

11688,2020-06-28 00:06:53,hh1ytp,"Shit that‚Äôs a good question, truth is it‚Äôs hard to pinpoint what he did when he did it and if it was illegal, most damning thing is the vids with his cousin and calling children sexy but at that idk if he can be charged for that. But I can tell you this he will lose everything if he says anything else or if more stuff comes out, and he will definitely have a target on his back"
11689,2020-06-29 07:25:59,hh1ytp,I'd be seriously surprised if he gets jail time. Hopefully something will happen but I don't see anything outside of him being sued coming of this.
11690,2020-06-29 07:32:47,hh1ytp,"Not original commenter but I remember in one video when he was on the plane it seemed like he was popping a few and mixing it with alcohol. I was at the peak of my addiction at that point and I thought it was the funniest shit ever but *now* I see it for how it is and that's incredibly dangerous and disgusting. His fans are so young and impressionable. You're the only two people I've ever seen address this before. 

I also remember him mentioning he's also on Adderall. I can't say for sure but I know what an addict looks like, especially when they're using the same drugs as I did and if he's not addicted he's at least using it recreationally which is not a good look. Not when you're in the public eye like he is."

I was treated like an addict when I went to the ER so I know what it‚Äôs like. We‚Äôre just people trying to get through life and had a couple bumps along the way, just like everyone else.

Mental illness has the stigma so bad. You say I am ocd (formally diagnosed) and have ptsd (formerly diagnosed) and people expect your head to go 360 on your neck and you'll spit at them any second now. Yet statesmen had it astronauts had it, etc etc. You don't lose your intellect.
My wife knew a bipolar person in group therapy and befriended her, and the shrink said there wasn't any hope for her. She and my wife had seriously deep conversations but no, he diagnosed her and that was that. A person is already suffering and they suffocate with all the labels.  
It's a mess.I identify it as alphabet soup üòÅ
I didn't want the stuff a MFC threw at me so I started digging and now I take suntheanine (my brand is doctor's best) for anxiety and to help me relax so the pain med works faster. It's an amino acid, and you don't space out, you just feel calm. Look into it if it interests you.
I was in a barnes and noble bookstore with my wife and out of nowhere I told her frantically I need to get out of here please get me out of here, and she helped me. We sat on a bench and I denied it ever happened. (I really sort of it did üòÅ)
To this day I don't know what triggered it and THAT freaked me out. Almost a psychologist heal thyself üòÅ
But nobody is as crazy as my current psychologist. We have phone and text sessions. Definitely a weirdo though. Chuckle. Actually he's amazing with both of us. Helps me keep her from self harm when she is most fragile. Insults me at least once a week and my wife giggles. I'm grateful I found him. He's trying to talk me into yoga. I saw a couple of  photos of advance poses and immediately had fibro pain level 10 grin (I have arthritis and fibromyalgia )
Ryland is amazing with his yoga btw

You hang in there. Just not literally üòØ
And for many of these suffering people all they need is help with believing in themselves and genuine kindness. Some hope."

Then we proceed to draft Tre Jones at 36??? What the fuck? Why? If you already gave us a facilitating PG that shoots a shitty clip from 3 in Nico, why give us another mediocre shooter in Tre instead of a Desmond Bane or Tyrell Terry?

Fuck this draft for the Sixers. I‚Äôm not even knocking the Oturu pick either, but I‚Äôd be heated if our best pick in the draft was a fucking center."

11858,2020-08-19 09:58:15,ic7opn,"wow this is bad ... so bad

first of all ESPN somehow still thinks Wiseman is a top pick but thats debatable at least 

Pistons picking a small ball big lmao this gotta be a joke the only two building blocks they have are a PF and C, they will absolutely pick a guard
(same should apply for the Hornets)

Mavs picking Maledon??? the Mavs have Luka, Brunson as ball handlers and even Curry can do that there is no chance on earth they are picking Maledon, they need off ball players and defenders (3&D)

Sixers picking Mannion, i think even the Sixers management realized by now they desperately need shot creators but this one is at least also debatable but not in combination with picking Tre Jones at 36 that really makes no sense thats the worst pick I have ever seen in a mock draft 

there are other very questionable picks but these ones really stand out since they are just mind boogling dumb"

11870,2020-08-18 21:34:48,ic7opn,This draft is so bad
11871,2020-08-18 20:41:55,ic7opn,"Idk what scouts are saying about him but I think he‚Äôs undervalued on this sub. He can feasibly play all 3 frontcourt positions in time, you can‚Äôt question his motor or physicality, and he can potentially be a scheme changer at the 5 if he can get his jumper right. Reminds me of a Jerami Grant that‚Äôs a little bigger and more rugged on the interior. 

Has the length, bounce and strength to protect the rim, but is mobile enough to guard the perimeter. Can hold it down on the boards, and also push in transition (tho he certainly needs to work on his passing). 

I don‚Äôt really like the fit with the Hornets but I‚Äôm fine with saying he‚Äôs a top ten or so talent"
11872,2020-08-18 20:08:31,ic7opn,"I like Achiuwa, he's got the makings for a solid role player that compliments pretty much any style if he cleans up the rougher areas of his game, but that's it, I don't think Top 10 makes much sense at all."
11873,2020-08-18 19:46:54,ic7opn,"That and the Cassius pick were definitely the most weird for me. I really don‚Äôt know about Precious I guess there is a lot of defensive upside, but him next to bridges is a really weird fit and it‚Äôs hard for me to see him being successful without having a really small offensive role. I think it‚Äôs a lot of projection and considering the recent overdrafting of guys who have projected defensive upside like, Jaxson Hayes, Zhaire Smith, Bamba and more. I definitely don‚Äôt get it and  was so turned off by his terrible offense that I don‚Äôt even have a first round grade on him."
11874,2020-08-19 03:44:53,ic7opn,With the dearth of talent on the Knicks the FO can‚Äôt afford to pick on fit or need they need to go BPA. That being said I‚Äôm not high on Toppin in general.
11875,2020-08-19 21:49:21,ic7opn,Don‚Äôt see how a proven scorer is a bad pick. Yes we need a PG badly but there‚Äôs only a couple in this draft worth taking. We need everything. Especially shooting obi at least gives us better spacing
11876,2020-08-18 19:54:51,ic7opn,"The fit is weird there next to Mitch, but Toppin is not a terrible shooter and will probably shoot threes pretty soon. I agree, but there‚Äôs a lot of rumors on the Knicks wanting to wait for Cade and next years class. Even then I wouldn‚Äôt take Toppin, but that‚Äôs some rationale. The defense would be so bad in the short term though"
11877,2020-08-18 22:34:31,ic7opn,"I say this to anyone, especially the bad teams, you guys need BPA. Doesn‚Äôt matter position or skill set. Whoever is the best player is the best thing for the Knicks going forward. Their below average talent should not determine who their next pick is."
11878,2020-08-18 23:43:01,ic7opn,"Really really doubt that we will draft him. However it's possible that the FO jwill ust go BPA with our first pick and then nabs Kira/Nico/Maledon/some other pg with the Clippers pic. Im pretty high on Kira, so if he slips until our second pick i wouldn't mind drafting Toppin"
11879,2020-08-18 20:48:44,ic7opn,Killian Hayes being available seems like a better fit imo
11880,2020-08-18 19:52:50,ic7opn,If the Celtics take Dok over Tillman I will be like very mad. I like dok just Tillman is a lot better
11881,2020-08-18 21:01:40,ic7opn,That fit next to booker would be so nice especially with Rubio starting until Hayes can get better at on ball D and be more consistent love that pick for the suns
11882,2020-08-18 20:59:49,ic7opn,"I definitely like Maxey over Rj, but RJ is a really good athlete and definitely has a lot of upside that wasn‚Äôt used much in the NBL. Celtics fit would be good for both, but I would definitely rather have Maxey and him Cole is a toss up for me"
11883,2020-08-18 23:51:12,ic7opn,"Sorta how I feel about my Bulls at 7. I want Deni, but if we get our pick of Haliburton, Hayes, Okoro, and Vassell I'll be pretty happy."
11884,2020-08-19 18:05:38,ic7opn,"and vassell still on the board. the 8-12 range of this draft actually seems pretty strong, glad we ended up in that position."
11885,2020-08-19 09:59:59,ic7opn,yeah this makes no sense for the Sixers this is really as worse as it gets really nothing makes sense i dont wanna insult somebody but the dude that made the Sixers pick really is an idiot
11886,2020-08-18 23:25:15,ic7opn,"I'd be happy with any of those three wings.  I don't think the fit with Maxey makes much sense--I haven't seen any Spurs fans clamor for him until now.  But, ultimately, I want best player available or to trade back.  I would love to focus on frontcourt players."
11887,2020-08-18 19:52:05,ic7opn,"Poku on the Nuggets is so funny imagine a lineup of Bol, Jokic, Poku, MPJ, and Like Murray or someone. God that‚Äôs such a long lineup. As a Celtics fan I don‚Äôt love it and obviously there were no trades, but I think we will trade a lot of these picks. I guess Madar is fine for a stash just worried about actual upside with him"
11888,2020-08-19 04:21:29,ic7opn,Deni good for them
11889,2020-08-19 00:49:04,ic7opn,You mfers are way too gassed up on him lmao
11890,2020-08-19 11:22:01,ic7opn,And Terry in the second round
11891,2020-08-19 04:20:41,ic7opn,They did also draft a power forward three straight years. Maxey would be good pick for them or Cole Anthony. If want more solid bet haliburton or Haynes could develop to help Gram.
11892,2020-08-19 04:17:15,ic7opn,"Why would we take Ball, we had a passer in Rubio who also played defense and we traded him. If we can resign him Malik Beasley, I love our backcourt. Get a shooter or a defender."
11893,2020-08-19 06:02:06,ic7opn,Got me wondering as well...
11894,2020-08-18 20:44:38,ic7opn,I really don't get why Nico Mannion is still in the first round. Is there a successful guard in the NBA with his lack of size and complete inability to score (or even get attempts) in the paint? He's not even compensating with elite shooting or defensive skills.
11895,2020-08-18 23:22:59,ic7opn,I've never seen Bey go higher than 13 in any mock.  He seems to be in that 14-24 range in a lot of people's eyes.
11896,2020-08-19 13:50:44,ic7opn,"Mavs need shot creators lol Seth doesn‚Äôt do shit on-ball in high leverage situations and really neither do Wright/Brunson/THJ(well he does but he‚Äôs inefficient).

There‚Äôs also the fact that Theo has actual footspeed on the perimeter + length unlike Wright/Seth/THJ/Doncic/basically their whole roster except MKG and DFS. 

Maledon would be a great pick as long as Carlisle uses him. Who says he can‚Äôt be offball either? Dude played offball for ASVEL this year"
11897,2020-08-19 12:28:22,ic7opn,Wish they would've done that for Kira to fall to my Sixers.
11898,2020-08-18 19:48:30,ic7opn,It was such a weird pick for me. I feel like the Raps are such a good development team that they should always just take guys who have athletic tools and high upside. Even if you were to take a FVV replacement Riller is so much better and would be cool to watch next to Lowry.
11899,2020-08-18 20:33:13,ic7opn,"If they lose FVV, Cassius Winston isn't the worst guy they could replace him with. I'm assuming that's the thinking with that pick."
11900,2020-08-18 20:27:05,ic7opn,Nothing shameful with picking Maledon over Green?
11901,2020-08-19 10:03:07,ic7opn,"why is he being downvoted, he is right

the only thing the Mavs dont need is p&r ball handlers"
11902,2020-08-18 23:14:42,ic7opn,"Don't like the fit?  By what you're describing, he should fit well anywhere."
11903,2020-08-18 19:54:56,ic7opn,"I think it was on the Game Theory podcast a few months back where Hollinger (??) brought up that he didn't see much difference between Achiuwa and Paul Reed, which I think is a really fair question. 

Achiuwa is only like 8 months younger, wasn't as productive, and has similar strengths and weaknesses. Yet we see one in the top 10 and one in the bottom 10. That just seems like a massive gap."
11904,2020-08-20 01:06:57,ic7opn,Toppin at 6 is certainly not BPA especially if Hayes and Hal are available.
11905,2020-08-18 23:18:11,ic7opn,He definitely shot better from 3 than other guys in this draft who are supposedly elite shooters.
11906,2020-08-19 04:14:23,ic7opn,Toppin is a safe pick but not the 4th best player in the draft.
11907,2020-08-19 01:04:45,ic7opn,Congratulations on the wonderful news Bulls fans received last Friday (?) about Boylen. Happy days hopefully ahead for your team. Go on AK lad.
11908,2020-08-19 04:57:41,ic7opn,If you'd be happy with any of those 5 then I'm sure you'll end up happy lol. At least 2 will probably be there for you guya
11909,2020-08-18 23:31:35,ic7opn,"I just think the value of Maxey at 11 (particularly compared to Nesmith) is excellent. He wouldn‚Äôt be my choice, but taking a guy like Nesmith who hasn‚Äôt shown really any creation ability (for himself or others) and wasn‚Äôt a strong defender in college would be a huge bummer for the highest spurs draft pick in 20+ years 

And for what it‚Äôs worth Maxey kinda seems like a Patty replacement with real defensive upside and it would be cool to see what he‚Äôd learn from him"
11910,2020-08-18 20:06:49,ic7opn,"Lol that's exactly what I thought. They are building such a tall roster that Poku seems such a natural fit with them. They will also have the time to develop him without putting on him too much pressure.Yam is a steal at #47, remember my words.I've watched him in the playoff series against Deni and a very strong Maccabi Tel Aviv team, he looked really good there. Flashy, bouncy, handle the ball well with both hands, great on-ball defender, can finish in different ways, reserve lay ups, step backs, side steps etc. Has a large offensive package. Spencer Perlman has twitted about him just few days ago, claimed he worth even a first round pick.

Check some of his latest highlights on this channel:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z\_B7NC5C4Hw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_B7NC5C4Hw)"
11911,2020-08-19 04:22:21,ic7opn,"Yeah, let them have Deni."
11912,2020-08-19 15:27:52,ic7opn,I will gladly accept this lol
11913,2020-08-19 15:27:39,ic7opn,"Oh man didn‚Äôt even see that, that‚Äôs devastating"
11914,2020-08-19 04:23:01,ic7opn,"I would hate if the Hornets drafted Cole Anthony or Maxey considering the way to improve our back court would be to add size, not add more short guards"
11915,2020-08-19 11:52:29,ic7opn,"Thibs wanted his guy and it was a major mistake to replace Rubio with Teague. And we didn‚Äôt get run of Rubio cause he was too good of a passer.

If melo can become a 6‚Äô7‚Äù Rubio that is a willing shooter and better scorer all around, then we have an all star."
11916,2020-08-18 21:02:33,ic7opn,"The only thing I can think of is that people cant let go of the player they saw in the Nike Hoop Summit. I know it creeps into my head when I think about him, but its hard to ignore what I saw out of him in the half court at Arizona. In the open court hes deadly and has a great feel on when to kick ahead and slice."
11917,2020-08-19 00:42:29,ic7opn,I don't know why honestly.. 6'8 switchable forward shooting 45% from three. Good role player is his floor
11918,2020-08-19 15:12:01,ic7opn,"Maledon only takes 2 3s per game and his defense isnt good, yes he has length and could be a decent defender in the future but thats a stretch 

the Mavs lacks some specialist alongside Luka and Porzingis, especially on the wing positions or at SG - Maledon is none of that and even if he reached most of his potential he would be very similiar to what Delon Wright is right now

just makes no sense to draft him"
11919,2020-08-19 12:54:07,ic7opn,Hahhahaha on a second thought I think we need Kira more since Dragic is aging and Nunn is inconsistent. Also Herro is more of a 2 anyways. üòÇ
11920,2020-08-18 19:55:47,ic7opn,"For sure , I‚Äôd rather try and take guys with more potential or at least fit better with our core going forward. Even in terms of PGs I‚Äôd rather have Riller, Tre or Dotson or bigs like Nnaji Tillman or Reed 

Draft night is gonna be controversial I can see it"
11921,2020-08-18 20:51:55,ic7opn,I guess but there‚Äôs other PGs I like better
11922,2020-08-18 21:10:10,ic7opn,"It's a stupid pick. The last thing the Mavs need is an unathletic low-ceiling PG next to Luka -- they already got Delon Wright for that, and he's been a horrible fit."
11923,2020-08-18 23:21:24,ic7opn,"I‚Äôm talking in terms of him carving out his role, or unlocking his highest upside. With them I don‚Äôt think he gets either, they have Bridges as a combo forward and PJ Washington as a 4/5 so between them he‚Äôs sorta redundant (and they‚Äôre both more skilled). And they‚Äôre also pretty anemic offensively so I don‚Äôt see him finding his niche quite well. 

Phoenix would be a pretty good fit, maybe the Kings. SA obviously"
11924,2020-08-18 23:56:22,ic7opn,Hornets are filled with guys who‚Äôd fit anywhere but probably don‚Äôt have a top 100 player in the league. They need a guy who‚Äôs for higher end upside IMO
11925,2020-08-20 02:41:04,ic7opn,Oh yeah I agree with you that Toppin is not BPA at 6. It‚Äôs just that if the Knicks do think he is BPA they should take Toppin disregarding whether or not he‚Äôll fit.
11926,2020-08-18 23:40:05,ic7opn,"What if Okoro, Toppin, or Okongwu were to fall to 11th?  Are you high on Vassell?"
11927,2020-08-19 04:25:32,ic7opn,I thought Anthony was a taller. Who do you want?
11928,2020-08-18 23:40:14,ic7opn,"He played with two bigs in the half court and like one real shooter. Not even taking to account the farther NBA line, he‚Äôs not ever gonna play in that scheme again. I think ppl are overreacting to how he looked in Arizona‚Äôs offense. 

He also won‚Äôt need to score as much as he was pressured into in college. He‚Äôs just a set up man who can hit the 3 a bit and get to the rim in transition"
11929,2020-08-19 01:01:22,ic7opn,I've seen a lot of debate over how good he actually is defensively.  Lotta people seem to think his defensive prowess is a bit overstated and question his lateral quickness.  I don't know enough to have any opinions on the matter.
11930,2020-08-18 21:18:00,ic7opn,Sure but also Winston probably has a similar scouting report to FVV out of college except the production was much higher
11931,2020-08-18 20:56:47,ic7opn,Cassius has the IQ of all those guys you like put together.
11932,2020-08-18 21:15:15,ic7opn,Imagine calling Theo unathletic or low ceiling
11933,2020-08-18 21:25:07,ic7opn,">unathletic

Maledon has a solid first step and great size at his position. He's not a jump out of the gym athlete, but that isn't really a weakness in his game. Compared to someone like Winston or even Killian Hayes, I'm not particularly worried about his physical ability.

>low-ceiling 

I disagree. He's one of the youngest players in the draft, is a versatile shooter, has a great finishing touch, strives as a PnR operator. If all of these skills translate long-term, that's a very good offensive player to have."
11934,2020-08-18 23:31:13,ic7opn,"How about a small ball lineup of Graham, Rozier, Bridges, Washington, and Achiuwa?"
11935,2020-08-19 00:46:24,ic7opn,I want him on the Mavs too replace Dwight Powell as our rim runner and actually provide rebounding and versatile defense.
11936,2020-08-19 02:05:16,ic7opn,"I think Devonte‚Äô and Cody are top 100 but overall agree.

Though Monk probably has more realistic star potential than people realise; even he is probably more an offball guard in his prime, a 2nd/3rd option type."
11937,2020-08-18 23:50:26,ic7opn,"I like all of them over Nesmith. I‚Äôd probably go Okoro-Pat Williams-Vassell-Okongwu-Maxey-Toppin-Nesmith. I really like Okoro, Williams and Vassell. I‚Äôd have Vassell over Williams in a vacuum, but I like Williams in SA with the existing young core a ton"
11938,2020-08-19 04:33:02,ic7opn,"Well I‚Äôd want Wiseman, Ball, Edwards, Okongwu, Avdija, Hayes, Haliburton, and Vassell in that order. Edwards and below is just going with BPA but also the better fit for the team."
11939,2020-08-19 02:17:39,ic7opn,So exactly the opposite of what the Sixers need
11940,2020-08-18 23:22:43,ic7opn,"Don't take it from me, here's an in-depth scouting report:

https://www.thestepien.com/2020/02/07/theo-maledon-scouting-report/

Now let's hear yours, genius."
11941,2020-08-18 23:06:27,ic7opn,"I look at Maledon, I see another Delon Wright in the making, more or less. Size, ""solid"", versatile combo guard, etc. Seriously, tell me how do you see this guy a level better.

Finally, the point is that this kind of player is not a fit for the Mavs next to Luka.  We need elite defense, more athleticism, off-ball offense, not another PG there -- his skills would be wasted.  

I mean, if he was a clear BPA, a star in the making, you can go for it and worry about the fit later. But this is clearly not the case, there other players that fit the Mavs better, and this guy would make much more sense for a team without a Doncic on it."
11942,2020-08-18 23:34:22,ic7opn,Not enough shooting and he also gets relegated to mostly rim running in that group. My thinking with them is that PJ is lowkey a small-ball 5 and Miles a 4. If they‚Äôre playing with a big it should be a Wiseman type
11943,2020-08-19 00:51:34,ic7opn,"Yeah if he ‚Äúfalls‚Äù to Dallas that‚Äôs the perfect fit. Was just giving teams in the similar range as in this mock. But yeah Porzingis stretching the floor and Luka getting him easy baskets. Spread offense to allow him to terrorize the paint. Great coaching

That‚Äôs actually the kinda situation I could see him hitting his ceiling in"
11944,2020-08-18 23:55:22,ic7opn,"I'm honestly really looking forward to this draft, and even the unveiling of the lottery order on Thursday.  I know, though, come draft day, the Spurs are gonna leave us extremely puzzled and disappointed with some left field selection that strikes us as the total opposite of what we ourselves woulda done and their refusal to engage in any trades."
11945,2020-08-19 02:21:02,ic7opn,"Well they def need a backup pg in general. His (theoretical) shooting should help, and they have enough weapons that he wouldn‚Äôt need to score and would be looking to get the right guys shots. He"
11946,2020-08-18 23:42:10,ic7opn,"Yeah, I was basically laughing when I wrote it.  I'm rooting for you guys.  Would love to see the Hornets pull themselves out of this eternal obscurity."
11947,2020-08-19 14:24:54,ic7opn,"Yeah, definitely feel like the Hornets could prioritize a rim defender.  They were a bottom 5 rebounding and shot blocking team and could easily upgrade over Zeller/Biyombo."
11948,2020-08-19 16:41:31,ic7opn,"not enough shooting?! That's a killer shooting lineup. PJ would play the 5 and just sit in the corner. Rozier on catch and shoot was incredible this year, devonte' is in the 99% tile of 3 pt shooters. Miles is average and has gotten better at 3s every year, and PJ is PJ."
11949,2020-08-19 00:27:00,ic7opn,"I I mean I‚Äôm so jacked for the lottery even if it is a weak class and it‚Äôs a 10% chance we move up. ‚Äôm *cautiously* optimistic about the draft. The Luka pick was definitely not my favorite, but Keldon and DWhite were good value picks that turned out great and Dejounte and Lonnie were upside swings we really never never take and I was pumped at the time. Hoping this year is more of the same, I feel like Brian Wright has really emphasized athleticism and I‚Äôm all for it"
11950,2020-08-19 02:48:42,ic7opn,We need good shooting and shot creators. No secondary playmaking guard is one of our biggest weaknesses
11951,2020-08-18 23:49:10,ic7opn,Not a hornets fan lol but yeah me too I‚Äôd like to see them become relevant. Kinda crazy they‚Äôve been trash for years while NC is called ‚ÄúHoop state‚Äù lol
11952,2020-08-19 17:19:16,ic7opn,"Ball in Graham‚Äôs hands, he‚Äôs got Precious who is a non shooter (which forces him to be the rim runner and goes to my point about the fit not being great for his development) and Bridges who is well below league average."
11953,2020-08-19 18:29:36,ic7opn,"We were middle of the pack in terms of attempts and average.  We‚Äôre already a solid shooting team, but you can never have too many shooters!"
11954,2020-08-19 02:51:27,ic7opn,He pretty much fills those holes
11955,2020-08-19 17:26:15,ic7opn,"regardless whoever they put on the floor with those 4 guys is gonna be the defacto cody zeller type. i'd much rather have a dude who is athletic and can move his feet defensively than wiseman who looks like he has KAT feet on that end. ultimately to get the most out of that team they are gonna have to hope PJ can bulk up and play the 5 like Bam, I don't really see a point in grabbing a slow center and trying to make him fit."
11956,2020-08-19 19:03:42,ic7opn,"for sure. i would want killian before precious, but also just anxious to see if we move up."
11957,2020-08-19 17:31:52,ic7opn,"Well again goes to my point, if I‚Äôm Precious‚Äô agent I don‚Äôt want him going there. And idk you probably just have a different opinion of him but I think a Wiseman dominating the paint is what they need (from this draft). Or around the league, a Mitchell Robinson. 7fter that will run, rebound and defend the paint, someone else pointed out they‚Äôre a bottom 5 rebounding and shot locking team"
11958,2020-08-19 17:36:03,ic7opn,"Maybe in this small ball lineup Achiuwa is the 5 and not PJ. Precious could maybe have some hidden Bam Adebayo type of potential if used properly.

 He's got similar measurables and has the defensive potential to be a small ball 5 in that way. His playmaking would definitely need work, be he's also a guy who was a wing in high school, so he could be able to handle the ball a lot better than we got to see at Memphis, we didn't see it from Bam either in college."
11959,2020-08-19 18:11:40,ic7opn,"I mean ideally the appeal would be him or PJ could cover 5-2. PJ has a 9foot standing reach and has plenty of size, just needs a couple of years of nba weights. The hornets just need someone with length and lateral foot speed. If a Rudy Gobert existed this draft, then sure go for it, I just don't think Wiseman has anywhere near that defensive potential and having a slow 5 is a death sentence defensively."
11960,2020-08-18 18:28:31,ic6b7n,Vampire?
11961,2020-08-18 18:29:07,ic6b7n,I always considered them to be more of a zombie myself but in the book it refers to them as vampires.

I did just try downloading Spotify now. If I turn the explicit filter off and try to play the album, it says that the album is explicit - no option for a clean one. Although, I think I remember seeing the clean version of the album on Spotify. Of course, only available on the US version."

11991,2020-08-16 01:13:00,iaj7vo,We are all generating the simulation by interacting with it
11992,2020-08-16 21:29:43,iaj7vo,"I bounced this off an anthropologist friend. She's heard of several versions but not Bostrom's work. The biggest thing many people do is try the problem from an anthropomorphic viewpoint. Like assuming a simulation is run for the benefit of humanity; Or, assuming humanity can guess accurately at the purpose.  


To me, it is enough that I can see many reasons to conduct a simulation. The medium it exists in need not be a traditional computer. The operator or designer need not be human.  


  
As for life in a simulated universe:  
I have long thought that being an atheist does not mean denying the existence of God to ""a bunch of dummies"". An intelligent and empathetic person should see that many people get a lot from religion (a US Senator recently claimed he'd be raping and killing if not for religion). As an atheist is not accountable to a higher being, living a morally upright life may mean little more than leaving the world better than you found it and trying to be good to people. As it is a self-imposed ideal, I think it is a more mature ideology. But, it's not for everyone.  


That said, I'm sure someone has put together a formula to show how distant habitable planets are from each other and how rare and relatively short-lived civilizations are likely to be. We are alone in the universe even if there is life out there (we will never meet it as it's too far away).  BUT, if we are in a simulation, we are not necessarily alone.  


This has good and bad. If our universe is a contagion that has arisen in the energy storage of a starship's engine, we are screwed; The same if we are playthings or test subjects. But, maybe there is a benevolence or intention behind the simulation. Maybe it is made by humans. AND, maybe the humans are kind and/or moral. Maybe every living thing in the simulation is stored prior to it's death (or maybe the simulation is searchable, time is funny like that). Perhaps they consider the simulation cruel but necessary and have a plan to ""make it up to us"" or ""give us another, better chance at life"". It's only about 600 billion people or so.   


The point is that in the worst case, a simulation is no worse than a cold, meaningless universe. In the best case, there are many, unknown challenges and opportunities waiting for us."

I've seen a number of compelling phenomenon in Quantum Physics. Most recently, the fact that multiple observers (detection devices) can detect a particle differently. I think it's called ""non-observer-independent"". This i s already on top of spooky action, dual slit insanity, self-checking shannon code, and much more.  


So, I'm adding to this post: If these are hints or proofs or proto-proofs, what does it mean? The creators of the simulation know physics and math will eventually be able to spot the non-smooth nature of time and space, etc. They know it's proof and are either OK with it or INTEND it.   


So, my next thoughts, if we are intended to discover this is a simulation (if the reverse were true this post wouldn't exist) then what purpose is served by discovering it?"

Because it shares the name with the BLM hashtag (which they started) they have an unprecedented amount of influence on politics, culture, social media, and corporations. The difficulty in explaining the difference between the civil rights movement and the organization that directs and profits off of it means most support for civil rights is conflated with the BLM organization, and being against the BLM organization implies that you hate black people. I wish the BLM movement was able to realize it before the Twitter movement began but it's far too late now.

The BLM organization is single handedly responsible for the failure of police reform over the past seven years. They have a substantial influence in the election of Donald Trump. And they have done nothing but increase polarization between the parties and non politically involved persons alike.

Except those who think only some black lives matter) under which they can do important work to fundamentally transform America, and get loads of money because OF COURSE black lives matter, let me write you a check. 

Their website is at least honest; end the nuclear family (because fatherlessness has worked out so well), and end anti-black racism (not end racism). So supporters are either good with Marx, or oblivious to what they are supporting. 

The rising violent crime rates going on in the most vulnerable neighborhoods as police are taken out **OUGHT** to shine light on the twisted logic that suggests the problem is over-policing, but I suspect the loss of lives and livelihoods will be ignored as they don't support the proper narrative,"
12042,2020-08-14 18:48:43,i9r7js,"Their [public support has steadily increased over the years](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2020/06/12/amid-protests-majorities-across-racial-and-ethnic-groups-express-support-for-the-black-lives-matter-movement/) so I don‚Äôt think you can argue that they haven‚Äôt changed minds.

They‚Äôre concerned mainly with structural racism in the criminal justice system ‚Äî the main problem isn‚Äôt white police officers killing blacks, but with the over policing of minority neighborhoods. 

We spend a lot of money putting police into black neighborhoods, but not a lot of money making the schools better, creating employment opportunities through commercial development, creating parks and places where young people can have healthy outlets for recreation ‚Äî all of these things have been shown to lower crime rates, and would lower homicide rates, because that is of course a concern in black communities.

Their argument is that the current strategy of mass incarceration creates a vicious cycle ‚Äî the more black men are removed from the community (especially on non-violent drug charges), the more black children will grow up fatherless, the less earning power black families will have, and when those black men are released back into the communities they will be unemployable, so the crime rate doesn‚Äôt go down.

Certainly the crime rate in black neighborhoods is a problem. We‚Äôve been using the same tactics for decades, and it doesn‚Äôt help the problem. If a strategy isn‚Äôt working, I think it‚Äôs a good idea to consider changing the strategy."

BLM USA needs to Divest themselves of Antifa and other Riotous/Insurrectionist/Domestic Terrorism actions. If they don't they will continue to bleed support from most people in all income brackets other than large corporations that are pandering to twitter and Far Leftist Progressives(Regressives) who do want to see a racialized society. The Portland Riots going on has activists and Rioters who are indistinguishable from each other when it comes to Antifa vs BLM.

There have also been rumors wherein a lot of the donations to BLM are being funneled to Democrat Politicians or the DNC directly. If these rumors are even partly true then it is my opinion that the BLM movement as a whole in America has strayed so far from its original purpose that the people that actually care about the original purpose of BLM should start a new organization.  However, [politifact](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jun/12/ryan-fournier/conservative-pundits-share-false-claim-about-black/) claims to have totally debunked this rumor though trust in politifact and actblue is very low among conservatives and moderates that are not sympathetic to far left causes.

For most people, when they say they support BLM, they really mean that they acknowledge the core principle of police inequality -- not the actions or message of any single organization.

It's like how you can support the concept of the 2nd amendment but not the NRA. 

In this case there's an organization that happens to have the name ""Black Lives Matter"", but it's wrong to think that they own BLM."
12046,2020-08-14 20:06:53,i9r7js,"I don't think of BLM as an organization. I think of it as a rallying cry. 

There *is* an organization with that name, but they aren't running all the protests. They did some early messaging that captured people's feelings on how America seems to not be living up to its stated principles, and a lot of people were inspired by that and are doing their own things.

edit: Also, you make it seem like the statement ""Black lives matter"" is intended to insult and condescend. But if someone says ""Save the rainforest,"" that doesn't elicit the same level of outrage that I see some people respond with when they hear ""Black lives matter."" If someone thinks that saying BLM is insulting them, maybe they should do a bit of self reflection and consider why they feel attacked by an affirmation that black people matter, but not attacked by an affirmation that trees matter."

Its core belief is the notion that race matters and is important and that your race determines your identity (aka racism).  Ironically, they share that fundamental epistemology with the KKK.  Also, it advocates the notion that (call it) a ""vast white racist conspiracy"" has been responsible for many black people's poor economic status instead of bad cultural values and bad life choices (out-of-wedlock birth, teenage pregnancy, bad parentage - not raising kids to have discipline, work ethic, and to value education, drug and alcohol abuse, and black on black crime).  

For example, SJW [Robin DiAngelo wrote a popular book and has made videos](https://youtu.be/gA5uBXaJ_Ec?t=580) that basically say that all white people are inherently racists, like a white version of original sin.  The intelligentsia that manage the Smithsonian African American museum were so ignorant and so steeped in racism that they [published a placard of ""white culture""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Vhv_1E-uFk) which basically said that having a nuclear family, rational thinking, working hard, and valuing education were ""white culture"" - as though people of other races have no business doing that or are incapable of it.  They did not think they were doing anything wrong or controversial and only took it down after they received an avalanche of criticism and became the laughing stock of satirists.  Then there's the Racist 1619 Project which is trying to paint a narrative that the United State's defining feature is slavery and racism, using unfounded historical claims (the Revolutionary War was fought to preserve slavery) while presumably ignoring the fact that Africans fought tribal wars and enslaved each other themselves and that slavery was prevalent in Africa.

In all likelihood, white people, Asians, and Hispanics are going to be fine.  I think the real damage is being done to poor black people by being told that their choices do not matter and that they are just victims of evil white racism.  I shudder to think of how horribly young black children must be getting indoctrinated with all of this.  I can imagine that they are being taught and brainwashed to believe that white people are all racist and that they have a black identity and should feel like freed slaves and victims as opposed to developing an individual identity.  It's so cruel.  BLM is probably going to end up holding the black community back for decades.  This is a greater victory for racism and black suppression than white supremacists and the KKK could have ever imagined, and they are doing it to themselves."
12053,2020-08-14 21:17:10,i9r7js,"BLM's founders admitted to be Marxists. Unless of course, you are talking about the movement in 2020. Then, I agree. 

But BLM was always pushing for some radical nonsense. The reason why a lot of people support it is because of its name. They think if they don't support it, then they are saying that black lives don't matter. Even after showing people the demands of BLM Seattle, BLM UK, BLM Canada, some people just can't say no to BLM. Because they think that if they don't support Black Lives Matter, then they must be racist. And they don't want to be racist."
12054,2020-08-15 00:42:35,i9r7js,A lot of BLM leaders are black supremacists. Some want a segregated blacks only state or country. Many of them are marxists as well.

But if someone says ""Save the rainforest,"" that doesn't elicit the same level of outrage that I see some people respond with when they hear ""Black lives matter.""

Oh my God I can't believe how many times I've seen this kind of comparison. It makes me die on the inside everytime I see it. 

""Kick it Out"" which is a campaign to kick out racism from football also didn't generate outrage. Even though, both BLM and Kick it Out campaign to fight racism. 

""Save the rainforest"" doesn't generate outrage because all it wants is to decrease deforestation. Kick it out didn't generate outrage because it combats racism regardless of the race of the victims. Black Lives Matter generates outrage because 1. it pushes for very radical reforms like decreasing funding for police, 2. It holds a negative attitude (ACAB) towards people who keep others safe. 3. BLM protestors are often engaged in violent protests. I never saw ""Save the rainforest"" protestors burn down a building. 4. BLM believes black victims of police brutality must be given more light than non-black victims of policy brutality. 5. BLM cares more about the race of the perpetrator than black lives being taken (I have never seen outrage when a black officer was the perpetrator)."

12066,2020-08-14 20:49:45,i9r7js,"The BLM movement created the All Lives Matter movement and the Blue Lives Matter movement, which combated or downplayed most efforts for change. I don't think it's controversial to state that the BLM organization and M4BL are pushing fare more extremist views than the public who are marching for equal treatment or holding protests in the streets. By attaching the BLM movement to the BLM organization through naming and influence, criticism against the organization's leaders became a hindrance to the entire movement.

Instead of creating a banner to rally behind BLM organization created a target to attack."
12067,2020-08-16 11:08:54,i9r7js,"By asking for communities and extended families to be more involved in helping to raise children, some of whom are fatherless? How is that a bad thing?"
12068,2020-08-15 20:45:10,i9r7js,I'm not sure people are generally afraid of Antifa.  I think for the most part they are disgusted by it.
12069,2020-08-15 00:36:53,i9r7js,"I know BLM have been in the mainstream consciousness since about 2016, but 'defund the police' and ACAB only became a part of mainstream debate about three months ago.

People were hostile to the *words* ""Black Lives Matter"" before any burning or violence happened at protests. There certainly has been some environmentalist violence. It doesn't get much media attention because it's not a wedge political issue, and because there simply hasn't been the same number of people out protesting for the environment as there has been for criminal justice reform. More people leads to more chance that a small number will be violent.

As for giving more light to black victims, yes, if a group has been mistreated in the past, you have to first provide restorative justice to get them up to the same level as everyone else. This is only a temporary demand, and will not be necessary once past grievances have been addressed.

I think you are cherry-picking bad things about the overall movement that has coalesced around the rallying cry that ""Black Live Matter."""
12070,2020-08-14 19:18:09,i9r7js,"We'll know more when they do their disclosure for 2020. Although I think it is done through another non-profit because they haven't been approved yet. I remember their 2019 numbers looking sketchy. All in all, the organization is scam. There are better organizations to donate to and be involved with. BLM reminds me of Wounded Warriors. Started out noble and turned into a corrupted organization that should be shut down.

Edit: Here is a discussion on this subject from a couple months ago in this subreddit.

https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatepolitics/comments/gzsz78/blm_and_actblue_where_is_the_money_going/

Edit2: And you can say it is debunked, but since we don't have their 2020 disclosure how do we know?"
12071,2020-08-14 21:01:03,i9r7js,"MLK frequently preached for nonviolence and was a figurehead for the movement. AFAIK he never demonized cops or tried to remove them, he just wanted police brutality to end. The BLM organization hasn't condemned violence happening at their protests this year, and they actively are trying to abolish the police.

> I really don't remember mainstream discussions of police and criminal justice reform at the level we are seeing now prior to the emergence of the BLM movement.

That's because Twitter wasn't a big thing before 2013. Twitter was at 100 million monthly users in 2011 and hit 200 million monthly users in 2012, to give you an idea of how fast this happened. The rise of BLM started with the rise of social media. The frustrations didn't get bigger in reaction to Trayvon Martin, they got louder. *Then* when BLM was picked up by more people it was able to get bigger."
12072,2020-08-14 21:22:57,i9r7js,"What you're seeing is a smokescreen. A lot of counties and states are doing that due to political pressure. But it doesn't mean that it will translate to actual changes in law/policy. Also, the general public is going to forget about this eventually. But the police won't. They will use the violence as justification for their own reform (greater pay, more powers, more recruitment, better training (more funding). And they're more likely to get what they want, as police unions have better and more centralized leadership than BLM."
12073,2020-08-14 22:38:37,i9r7js,"United Providence supported BLMT (BlackLivesMatterToo) from 2014 onward due to the reactionism to BLM and due to disagreements with the BLM leadership.

12076,2020-08-15 00:34:52,i9r7js,">  They nominally are just going to be redistributing it to local groups anyways. If you really want to make a difference why not find an organization in your area and donate to them or better yet reach out and see what they need most to be successful which may be money or could be something else.

You might not know any good local organizations. Or you may want to have your money go to wherever it can be most useful (maybe local organizations in your city are funded but Cleveland's aren't) and believe that BLM can do that efficiently (I don't know if they can but someone may believe that)"

Tbh I reckon this is just a way for Spotify to leech off of people's rap/underground rap knowledge so they can put shit on rap caviar. 

They know certain people have a trend of listening to rappers before they blow up so now they're tryna monitor and use those people to push their overrated playlist"

12267,2020-08-10 00:46:05,i6uk27,"I'm not sure I've ever even heard of a trans person who *didn't* struggle with doubt at some point in their transition. It is so, so, *so* common to have the fears you're having. After all, what you're going through is objectively big and important and understandably scary, and the consequences feel really heavy.

I didn't 100% believe that I was ""actually transgender"" until *years* after I started testosterone. There was even a point in time when I felt *certain* that I must have been wrong and that I was ultimately going to detransition. (I also started T just before turning 16.)

I don't know what ever made those fears go away in the end. I think I just kept moving forward, kept living my life -- as a trans person -- and ultimately was able to realize that, hey, I really do feel right this way, I like the direction I'm moving in, and I think this is always going to feel right for me.

Keep listening to yourself and paying attention to what you're feeling, of course, but it sounds like you're going through a very normal process of apprehension. I think just about every trans guy goes through the same thing at some point, *especially* directly before starting T."
12268,2020-08-10 00:52:52,i6uk27,"oh man i was super nervous. even though i knew it‚Äôs what i wanted it was still something that was pretty big and daunting just because i knew it would cause changes and even though they were changes i WANTED, im the kinda guy who does Not Like Change.

that was 11 months ago.
i have never been happier.
i looked in the mirror today and while i‚Äôm a short chubby dude who‚Äôs not like conventionally attractive i literally thought aloud ‚Äúdamn i‚Äôm handsome what the fuck?‚Äù

i never thought i‚Äôd get there.

i was asked a lot ‚Äúwhat if you change your mind?!?!‚Äù and all i could say was ‚Äúi won‚Äôt.‚Äù because. like. god why would i?? 
people who have detransitioned are super valid, because yknow. gender is complicated. but for the most part i can‚Äôt say i know anyone who‚Äôs transitioning and regrets it, it really is quite rare. i think you‚Äôll be alright, friend."
12269,2020-08-10 00:42:19,i6uk27,"Hello :)
From what I‚Äôve read there‚Äôs very few people who transition who later regret it! But also it makes sense that when making a big decision you‚Äôd be anxious about it. I suggest talking with people who support you and your transition and maybe they can help you understand where the anxiety about starting T is coming from. Even though it sounds like it‚Äôs been something you‚Äôve been looking forward to for a while, it‚Äôs perfectly normal to feel scared of the unknown or changes that will happen as well. 
I‚Äôm no expert on starting T or transitioning (I haven‚Äôt gone on T yet) but I certainly think I‚Äôll be nervous to start as well."
12270,2020-08-10 01:02:31,i6uk27,I can help you cause I haven‚Äôt started hormones but if you ever need to talk I‚Äôm also 15 so I can help with being in school transitioning

12300,2020-08-09 13:04:36,i6fe05,"Never been in the trade CJ camp. But I agree that Gary‚Äôs play means you have to start to consider it. However I‚Äôm yet to see a realistic trade idea for a player that improves this team (open to ideas).

Gary is only in his second year. If it takes a max extension, so be it. You keep him at all costs. He‚Äôs 22. His timeline still lines up perfectly to take over as starter in a couple of years as cj slows down. He‚Äôd still only be 24-25.

Off season

Let hassan walk (unless there‚Äôs a good sign and trade offer).

Guarantee Ariza.

Offer Melo the max vet min or our smallest exception for a championship run as a 20mpg backup PF. 

Resign wenyen on a year or two min deal.

Ideally Mario doesn‚Äôt opt in and comes to Europe. 

Use our pick on the best available player (I trust olsheys pick record). 

Offer Tristan Thompson our biggest exception (approx $8-9m). One or two years plus a player option. We‚Äôve no idea what the free angency values or Cap are going to look like yet. But I think TT will be around this price. If not there‚Äôs a few other veteran back up centres available (plumblee?).

Pick up a veteran PG on a minimum contract. Shabazz? (I‚Äôm pro-Anfernee, I think he‚Äôll still be backup behind dame. This signing is deep bench/injury insurance). 

Our line up looks like...

Dame/CJ/Hood/Zach/Nurk

Anf/ScaryGary/Ariza/Melo/Tristan Thompson

Vet PG/1st Round Pick/Nas/Mario (if he opts in)/Wenyen


We‚Äôd be over cap but could probably keep out of any heavy taxes. No massive money commitments except a tradable centre and we have a few tradable expirings for any in season action that may arise."
12301,2020-08-09 11:19:45,i6fe05,Fuck that we got 3 games left to make the playoffs let's kick Denver or PGs ass again

You got Demar, Harrell, Draymond, Otto Porter, and Gordon Hayward which I can think off the top of my head. We only have a MLE so we prob can‚Äôt get any of them put it‚Äôs fun to think about"
12303,2020-08-09 17:41:32,i6fe05,Only semi-realistic player I'd really be interested in trading CJ for is Ben Simmons.  Only happens if the 76ers give up on pairing him with Embiid and decide to just surround Embiid with shooters though.

12372,2020-09-05 00:42:08,imqnl4,I used to think that it was all tricks or arranged stunts until I listened to him on Joe Rogan. Now im convinced hes just a very passionate dude that do extreme stuff that requires secret techniques and the mental of a god.
12373,2020-09-05 00:18:59,imqnl4,Real
12374,2020-09-05 16:58:58,imqnl4,On the first bullet point.  I agree that that seemed fake when he guessed Jaden's temperature.  And kinda unnecessary.  But what if it was just a lucky guess and a directorial / editing decision to keep it in?  Maybe they had an hour of footage and he guessed a couple other things incorrectly but they just kept that one part.
12375,2020-09-10 14:25:11,imqnl4,"Personally I don't believe he fakes any of his stunts but let me just say a couple of things about what you wrote:

1. When he guessed Jaden's temperature correctly, its possible that he has shown the cryochamber thing to other celebs and has seen what the average temperature is after they leave. Another idea I have is that it was just a lucky guess (ie when he went on Joe Rogan he guessed Joe's number when he rolled a dice twice). Or, as someone mentioned down below, he could have just had a couple of other things incorrectly but they kept this one because it was correct.
2. From his interview on Joe Rogan, I can tell he wants to show people that what he is doing is legit. Again, with the dice example, he asked Joe to check if the dice is weighted. And he probably just checked the temperature twice to show people that it was legit and not just a mistake.
3. I think the fog appears to behave weirdly because of the extremely low temperatures (its supposed to be less than -100 degrees Celsius). Obviously cold air is supposed to sink, so it makes sense that air that is literally below -100 degrees would sink quite a lot."
12376,2020-09-05 00:42:23,imqnl4,"Hi on Joe Rogan, I'm Dadüë®"
12377,2020-09-14 22:28:59,imqnl4,"On your first point, I definitely agree that it could‚Äôve just been a lucky guess with other guesses edited out to make it look more impressive. But I would still classify that as ‚Äúmagic‚Äù, in the sense that what appears to be happening isn‚Äôt really the full story and has a reasonable explanation.

However, the ‚Äúdice‚Äù part of your argument only works if you assume what I think you‚Äôre implying, which is that you think David guessing the number on Joe‚Äôs dice was real? As in he has some sort of supernatural power to do that? To me, this is *clearly* a magic trick. Something like [Mental Dice](https://youtu.be/yo3RvpGg300). Sorry to burst your bubble on that one :/"
12378,2020-09-15 18:07:41,imqnl4,i dont think he has some supernatural power to do that lol. my point was that he asked Joe to check if the dice is weighted. thats just a super unnecessary thing to say and therefore it shows that he likes showing people that he's legit (which would explain why he checked his temperature twice)

12380,2020-09-03 17:20:33,ilxboo,"Not sure to what degree he's taking fit into account, but this is a solid mock imo. For example, idk why the Sixers would take Srubb after grabbing Hampton/Terry/Flynn/Joe (I like those first 4 picks though).

Agreed on LaMelo at 1 I don't think Edwards is as seamless of a fit as people are portraying it.

Also love seeing Jessup in the top 60. He's an interesting ""pre-stash"" guy and one of the best shooters in the class."
12381,2020-09-03 18:35:07,ilxboo,"Loving that this projection has The Spurs 2nd pick at #41 as  Udoka Azubuike.    Been hyped on this possibility for some time now.    If it happens, imagine Udoka being mentored by Timmy."
12382,2020-09-03 18:47:02,ilxboo,"For the Knicks, I love this.. I‚Äôm a huge believer in Hayes‚Äô super high ceiling. Huge Cuse fan, so Elijah Hughes I‚Äôm in on (even though I don‚Äôt realistically see him being anything more than a end of the bench guy) and Nico Mannion in the 2nd would be a nice lottery ticket."
12383,2020-09-03 18:49:11,ilxboo,"I'd love the Spurs to grab Patrick Williams at #11, but I'm not so sure about Udoka Azubuike at #41 when guys with greater skill like Grant Riller, Killian Tillie, Isaiah Joe, and Paul Reed are all still there.  I like the idea of Azubuike, though, if he can shape up to be the next Clint Capela.  I mean, the kid is definitely a monster."
12384,2020-09-03 23:46:31,ilxboo,"Is this a mock draft done by a 76ers fan? Too perfect for them to end up with Hampton, Terry, Flynn and Joe."
12385,2020-09-03 18:56:07,ilxboo,"Love this draft for the Wolves, Warriors, Hornets, Mavs, Blazers, and Celtics.  I think they all make great selections and get great value here."

12388,2020-09-03 20:56:18,ilxboo,">There is more smoke coming out of the Warriors front office right now than anywhere else in the league. One week they like Tyrese Haliburton. Another week it‚Äôs Anthony Edwards. One week they like James Wiseman. Another week they like Onyeka Okongwu more than Wiseman. I think there is some truth to some of the stuff being thrown out there, but that front office does tend to be very talkative, and the Warriors know what they are doing when they talk to reporters. The front office started the smoke screen process earlier than anyone else this year, using its willingness to engage with reporters to its advantage.

This has been my thought from the start. The warriors had zero incentive to tip off reporters about what direction they are leaning, but people were taking these rumors as gospel. 

Trading back and getting Okongwu, Deni, Okoro, Vassell...etc always made the most sense to me. Ball and Edwards have a lot of upside, but Curry is in his prime and they dont have a lot of time to waste by waiting around for kids to develop."

12402,2020-09-03 20:47:16,ilxboo,The Pistons passed up on Hayes (need a PG and have French connection with Sekou) for Okoro (a guy that will remind them of Stanley Johnson)?
12403,2020-09-03 19:07:20,ilxboo,"Celtics looking to stash  Pokusevski  and Bolmaro?  Then adding wings? If Wanamaker (the back-up/3rd PG) and/or Kanter  (back-up C) leave, I'd think the draft is the more cost-effective way to find replacements. 

But the Celtics have so many things to be settled before the draft (I assume they will have a very good idea on opt-ins even if that deadline remains a day after the draft), and flexibility with three picks, that it is tough to project. If draft and stash is a big part of their strategy, seems like using the second-rounder on Yam Madar or Filip Petrusev might be a better fit."

Totally down for the Riller pick though."
12411,2020-09-04 19:32:16,ilxboo,Why is Tyler Bey ans Paul Reed are so low. I tought Sam was a Paul Reed guy.

12413,2020-09-03 18:58:06,ilxboo,STOP PUTTING OBI ON THE CAVS IN THESE MOCKS HE IS AN AWFUL FIT AND THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT WE NEED AND HE DOESNT HAVE THE SAME CEILING SOMEONE LIKE OKORO HAS THERE JEEZ
12414,2020-09-04 08:25:25,ilxboo,"Can somebody explain to me why mock drafts keep assigning Maxey to the Mavs at 18?

I don't get the fit next to Luka -- he'll kill the spacing (unless that 3PT% stats dont tell the whole story), he doesn't seem to have the size/athleticism to be an elite defender, his passing is nothing to write home about... so why?? Relatively small dudes who can get some buckets are a dime a dozen...

How's he a better fit than let's say Trey Burke -- especially now that Burke is working hard to defense...?"
12415,2020-09-03 17:32:23,ilxboo,"Agree about Edwards, I'd rather explore trade down options before taking him at 1 if I'm Rosas. Would rather have a wing/forward that will compliment Towns and Russell better, plus additional bench depth/a pick next year."
12416,2020-09-03 17:52:10,ilxboo,Terry at 34 is a fleece for us
12417,2020-09-03 21:46:20,ilxboo,"> Agreed on LaMelo at 1 I don't think Edwards is as seamless of a fit as people are portraying it.

He really isn't. I think most people are just assuming that he's a better fit than Ball (a PG when the Wolves already have DLo) or Wiseman (a C when the Wolves already have KAT) because he's a SG. 

However, even ignoring the issues with defense and motor, Edwards did the majority of his scoring out of pure iso plays, he didn't do much as a scorer or passer out of the pick-and-roll, and he was a bad spot-up shooter (only 28.9% shooting on catch on shoot jumpers). The lack of P&R ability makes him a poor fit with KAT, and the lack of catch and shoot ability makes him a poor fit with DLo."
12418,2020-09-03 20:46:08,ilxboo,"Probably just BPA with regard to Scrubb. It‚Äôs the late second round so just a crapshoot at that point, no need to worry about fit."
12419,2020-09-03 21:17:44,ilxboo,Same. I've been watching him since he was a freshman at Kansas and said he'd be really good in a Spurs uniform one day. Not to mention Timmy mentoring him would be a plus.
12420,2020-09-03 19:28:00,ilxboo,"Same, i would maybe prefer Woodard or Bane with the Clippers pick, but im good with Hughes too"
12421,2020-09-03 20:25:24,ilxboo,I'd probably prefer Terry with the clippers pick but I do love Hughes for the skills and his intangibles. Idk about Nico Mannion tho
12422,2020-09-05 02:40:05,ilxboo,"According to this we‚Äôd have the opportunity to walk away with Hayes, Bane, Nico/Riller.  Yes please"
12423,2020-09-03 19:27:43,ilxboo,Man Williams at 11 and Riller at 41 would be incredible. Two guys who could (hopefully) fill the spots of Rudy and Patty over the next few years.
12424,2020-09-04 01:55:13,ilxboo,Ive been watching tillie since last year and hope we can get him. I think we need more skill in a back up center if Jakob is going to be our starter
12425,2020-09-03 21:19:42,ilxboo,"I honestly feel he could be more than Clint Capela. He is a beast though, which I agree."
12426,2020-09-05 11:29:52,ilxboo,Honestly I rather just trade up and get Tyler Bey.
12427,2020-09-04 05:32:38,ilxboo,I was a little confused too that Terry just miraculously fell to 34 for us here
12428,2020-09-03 18:32:23,ilxboo,"He says they prioritize him and Deni and if Avdija isn't available, they're going for him. Also points out that it will make their league-worse defense even more terrible, apparently they don't care."
12429,2020-09-03 20:36:52,ilxboo,okoro is the perfect guy
12430,2020-09-04 03:59:50,ilxboo,I think Sexton and Okoro are friends so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he‚Äôs there the Cavs take him. Fits exactly what they‚Äôre looking for defensively as well.
12431,2020-09-04 01:50:49,ilxboo,"Just curious, what‚Äôs the knock on him? Everything I‚Äôve heard seems to indicate he‚Äôll be great offensively, and sure his defense isn‚Äôt great but that matters less and less it seems"
12432,2020-09-03 20:47:31,ilxboo,Why not? He projects as the best overall offensive prospect in the draft.
12433,2020-09-04 20:51:39,ilxboo,"Having Bridges, Cam Johnson, and Vassell locked in for a long time would be awesome. All those guys do is make positive contributions.

I have a dream of watching those three in a lineup with ayton and Booker playing point for stretches"
12434,2020-09-03 22:07:15,ilxboo,"Passing on Edwards for Okongwu and Okoro for the sake of short-term investment doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. All of them are equally risky, being extremely young and underdeveloped in certain important areas of their game"
12435,2020-09-03 20:45:10,ilxboo,Let's get weird with it.
12436,2020-09-04 01:33:07,ilxboo,"I loooove Terry/Malachi/Joe in the 2nd, I‚Äôd rate all those guys as late first prospects.

I don‚Äôt know enough about RJ Hampton to really have thoughts on him, but I‚Äôd rather Desmond Bane there, or trade up to 18 or 19 for Maxey or Cole. If either of those guys or Kira drops close to our pick, I think it‚Äôs worth a trade up provided we give up one early 2nd.

Also wish we would‚Äôve nabbed Riller at one of those 2nd round picks, but Vecenie is clearly much lower on him than I am."
12437,2020-09-04 01:29:58,ilxboo,"Makes no sense to me. I get him not being a lottery pick or anything, but he‚Äôs perfect in the 20‚Äôs as instant bench offense for a contender. If he drops out of the 1st, I‚Äôd be shocked to see him get passed the Sixers couple picks in the early 2nd."
12438,2020-09-03 23:13:25,ilxboo,Do you like picking Udoka there even with some of the other guys who are still on the board in this scenario?
12439,2020-09-03 22:55:41,ilxboo,"What does Tillman do for the Cs that they don't have enough of? I would think (but obviously not sure) that if they pick up a big in the draft it's either someone who can shoot from the outside, not being completely sold on Grant there, or someone who can bang with 7 footers in the post when necessary, as Kanter has one more year on his"
12440,2020-09-03 19:21:41,ilxboo,"Logic dictates PG or C, but maybe it's that Okoro has the most upside from who's left. Maybe they move up, where there are higher upside players who fit their needs, or move down the pick to get 2 or more (like suggested on this sub a few weeks ago, possibly with BOS) where they can fit more needs

Edit: revisited the article to see the explanation, basically he pins it to the new GM who was in OKC prior, where they valued athletic, hard working wings, regardless of their shooting ability. He's assuming it will carry on to DET."
12441,2020-09-04 00:49:13,ilxboo,"I think the idea is that because OKC always seemed to draft the most  athletic wing available, Troy Weaver will do it in Detroit too."
12442,2020-09-03 20:19:34,ilxboo,"I'm not high on Delon, plus he has 2 years/$17.5M remaining, compared to any PG you'd take at #15, on a 4-year/$15.765M deal (based on original predictions, will probably be lower) with 2 team options. I guess if they like Wright and want maybe Jalen Smith they can go for it, but that means you have 48 minutes of non-shooting PG. Dallas would probably take it, as Wright was completely out of rotation in the playoffs, plus at #15 they can get a quality wing (probably)."
12443,2020-09-03 22:56:44,ilxboo,"Doesn't Kanter have another year on his deal? He signed a 2 year contract. Wanamaker is on the minimum now and should make more elsewhere so I don't expect him to be back, but there are candidates to take his minutes on the roster now. None of them have looked very good at PG this season, but Carsen, Tremont Edwards, and Romeo might all get a shot at some 3rd string PG minutes if only to see what the team has there. If the team takes Poku / Bolmaro, I'm not 100% that the strategy is draft and stash - Poku could use professional NBA strength training for one - but instead to take big risks in hopes of hitting on a star because the roster is so well filled out otherwise."
12444,2020-09-03 23:10:47,ilxboo,He already agreed to an unpaid internship with the Spurs.
12445,2020-09-03 20:51:46,ilxboo,Stop yelling
12446,2020-09-05 13:57:49,ilxboo,"What?

Burke isn‚Äôt a good defender. Maxey is a very good one. Saying Maxey doesn‚Äôt have the athleticism to be a good defender makes me think, or makes me know that you‚Äôve never watched Maxey tape. He‚Äôs a very good athlete.

He was considered one of the best shooters in the class before the cal system hurt him.

Lots of Kentucky players go to the pros and become very good at things where they either limited by system or just weren‚Äôt allowed to at all.

Bam wasn‚Äôt handling at Kentucky 
Booker was mainly considered a spot up shooter
KAT didn‚Äôt shoot at all and now he‚Äôs the best stretch big in the league, could be all time level in that regard.

And theoretically the fit next to luka would be great. His great POA defense would be a major help next to luka. He would be a secondary playmaker, able to create for others & himself. If there‚Äôs the change from the flashes he‚Äôs shown that he becomes a pretty good shooter then the Mavericks no doubt got a steal at 18"
12447,2020-09-03 22:14:23,ilxboo,Edwards still has the most likelihood of becoming a superstar out of anyone in this draft imo. I think the fit might not be perfect but it might actually be better than people think. I see a real possibility that LaMelo simply struggles like Lonzo and doesn‚Äôt have great value after he starts to see playing time and so trading him later on seems like a losing proposition.
12448,2020-09-04 13:12:07,ilxboo,I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a chance he‚Äôs still available at 41. I think he‚Äôs a FRP
12449,2020-09-04 03:42:03,ilxboo,"Laterally he seems very slow, which makes him unplayable in the pick and roll.  Offensively he seems like he has good hands and he can establish position early."
12450,2020-09-03 20:16:44,ilxboo,None of the Athletic writers have any sources within the Cavs anymore so I wouldn't worry about it.   Toppin won't be their pick.  Thanks for posting the mock.
12451,2020-09-04 02:20:14,ilxboo,That's grim if they don't care about defence at all. I'd question what his sources are on that though.
12452,2020-09-03 19:12:08,ilxboo,Where did you hear that?
12453,2020-09-05 11:13:14,ilxboo,"He doesn‚Äôt have a neck, which is weird for a tall guy. It makes him look like he isn‚Äôt mobile."
12454,2020-09-04 00:19:31,ilxboo,"I worry a lot about Obi on offence. Just look at him in the post, absolutely no finesse or technical ability, he scores because he was 22 and far stronger than the weak bodied college kids.

I was higher on him but as i had nothing to do i really deep dived his game. I don't think his shot is particularly great, he is bad at putting it on the floor and even in the half court he looks sluggish.

He was put in a simple offsenive system where he could easily score against weaker defenders in PnR and in the Post.

His offensive game is flawed and his defence is atrocious. I think it is absolute lunacy to take him high in this draft."
12455,2020-09-03 21:38:27,ilxboo,"Older than all their other young prospects 

Atrocious defensively ,and the cavs are already bad enough on that end as is."
12456,2020-09-04 22:43:21,ilxboo,"Although, to reach the finals, one of those guys should at least end up as an All-Star."
12457,2020-09-04 02:25:19,ilxboo,"Not to mention if the Warriors keep the pick then whoever it is will be coming off the bench. Edwards/whoever else might not be able to contribute in the playoffs, but they could still give the Warriors 20-25 minutes in the regular season."
12458,2020-09-04 02:18:47,ilxboo,"Not really, both O‚Äôs have respectable floors as winning defense-first, high energy role players which is great for a team in the Warriors position. Theyve fit guys like Mckinnie and Jordan Bell into the rotation on championship teams. 

The problem with Ball and Edwards is that in the short term they may just be negatives on the court when it comes to playoff basketball because of their lack of defense and questionable habits"
12459,2020-09-04 03:46:35,ilxboo,"I agree with these takes. RJ I'm not too high on and I would rather trade up in the range to have a chance at Maxey/Kira/Cole. I really would like to trade up this year. Also wish we git Riller, I'd take him before Flynn tbh. Riller is a 1st round talent."
12460,2020-09-04 02:00:03,ilxboo,"On his big board (updated yesterday) he has him at 26. He's said in the past he's higher on him than most and has a first round grade on him. Must be hearing something to consistently mock him in the mid 40s

e: Had him going 48 in his mock the day after the lottery, and 47 back in July.  Meanwhile on his big board, which usually comes out around the same time as his mock, Riller has been bouncing between 25 and 26."
12461,2020-09-03 23:27:51,ilxboo,Can‚Äôt lie and say that I‚Äôve seen him but the description is that he can defend the post and communicates constantly on defense too. Not great on perimeter but knows his strengths and weaknesses. Can pass and makes right read on offense. Doesn‚Äôt this feel like an easy fit for the Celtics?
12462,2020-09-03 23:59:03,ilxboo,"I‚Äôve watched every game of Tillman‚Äôs college career, he will definitely be able to guard big guys down low"
12463,2020-09-05 14:09:31,ilxboo,None of the Celtics bigs have this defensive Iq while also being very good rim protectors. Grant just isn‚Äôt a good interior defender. Tillman is a very very good one. Tillman is also a very good passer and is a much better roller then grant
12464,2020-09-03 20:39:53,ilxboo,"I'd have to agree with you. I don't think it's any secret that the Magic are looking for guards, but I think Delon would work well with them. From what I've seen, he's a player that does a lot better with a defined role. He's a distributor with plus defense. We have a surplus of distributors. I think he would work decently in the Magic system. It's all about how they value Aminu. He's dealt with injuries and they seem to be perpetual purgatory with 6'7-7'0 bigs with thin PG Depth. I don't think anyone they'd target at 15 would be gone at 18 and Delon could be an insurance pick up if nothing else. They also have the same contract length with Delon getting a 1.5 less in their final contract year"
12465,2020-09-03 23:15:41,ilxboo,"He‚Äôll probably have a better career in San Antonio than Atlanta...let‚Äôs just be honest lol.

I know people are low on this draft, but almost all the top prospects have specialized skill sets that I can see them excelling with if they‚Äôre placed in a role that doesn‚Äôt ask too much of them.

Not sure why you‚Äôre bringing up McKinnie and Bell either. There‚Äôs not really a point in being high-energy if you‚Äôre a bad defender, which was especially true in McKinnie‚Äôs case. In fact, he was so bad that he couldn‚Äôt even win a job as Glenn Robinson‚Äôs backup last season and got promptly cut after training camp. That‚Äôs not going to be what the Warriors are hoping for out of a top-3 pick.

As it stands Okoro is a non-shooter who generated a majority of his offense at PF at 6‚Äô6 and 220-pounds. Okongwu doesn‚Äôt really have a translatable offense to the NBA outside of catching lobs and rim-running.

I literally said it lol. If the Warriors have won championships with those guys in the rotation, then they‚Äôd feel comfortable with Okoro (Mckinnie role) or Okongwu (Bell role) sliding in and playing playing their roles.

>As it stands Okoro is a non-shooter who generated a majority of his offense at PF at 6‚Äô6 and 220-pounds. 

Which is okay with the Warriors spacing and movement. He‚Äôs a great cutter, screener, can offensive rebound, terror in transition. He can fill a role on offense. Just because he‚Äôs not a shooter doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs a negative offensively

>Okongwu doesn‚Äôt really have a translatable offense to the NBA **outside of catching lobs and rim-running.**

Which can make you a positive on offense. Especially considering Steph and Klay‚Äôs gravity

To my larger point. I can‚Äôt see how you would think Edwards or Ball arent ‚Äúriskier‚Äù for a team like the Warriors when they both play no defense and have shot selection and effort concerns. The whole point of trading back would be to get a guy like either O or Vassell who they have confidence in plugging into smaller roles, while also getting another asset/rotational player"

12478,2020-09-04 04:01:13,ilxboo,"You can‚Äôt be seriously thinking the Warriors are trying to find a McKinnie and Bell with a top draft pick. McKinnie was awful for the Warriors and they were forced to play him only because injuries forced their hand. And where are you coming up with this narrative that either contributed heavily in their championship run? Bell averaged under 9 minutes a game in postseason and was straight up inactive for half of their games. Similar story with McKinnie. 

The Warriors can find a wing who‚Äôs a good cutter, screener, and rebounder for the veteran minimum. That was literally McKinnie‚Äôs role on the team, who got cut for all his effort because that‚Äôs all he offered.

With Okongwu, similarly, the Warriors can find rim-running and lob-catching from any random center off the street. That‚Äôs literally Chriss‚Äôs role on the team, who not to mention is more athletic and offensively skilled than a 19-year old Okongwu. Why would they draft a center in the top-10 to be a poor man‚Äôs Chriss as a rookie?

What‚Äôs important for a NBA GM with a top-3 pick is understanding the concept of value, which I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre quite comprehending. Drafting a player with a top-3 pick solely for the purpose of filling a role that had historically been filled by second-round picks and undrafted players would be a hilariously awful mismanagement of resources. Veteran minimum contracts exist for a purpose. Top-3 draft picks exist for another purpose. And with the Warriors willingness to buy in on another former ‚Äúbad shot-selection bad defense‚Äù experiment with Wiggins, I think they‚Äôll be much more confident in Edwards‚Äôs ability to contribute than you.

12483,2020-09-04 04:14:27,ilxboo,"Look all I‚Äôm doing is explaining the rationale behind trading back, I‚Äôm not saying the Warriors will or won‚Äôt do this. Your OP was:

>Passing on Edwards for Okongwu and Okoro for the sake of short-term investment doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. All of them are equally risky, being extremely young and underdeveloped in certain important areas of their game

And I just disagree that they‚Äôre all ‚Äúequally risky‚Äù. Okoro/Okongwu/Vassell/Haliburton, those guys are tailor made role players right now basically. And then by trading back you presumably will get another piece for depth or another asset. They may choose this route over a Ball or Edwards who are notorious for defensive shortcomings and displaying habits that aren‚Äôt conducive to winning. I‚Äôm that sense theyre **riskier** than the other guys listed.

I brought up Mckinnie and Bell not to say they were huge contributors but that if they even got any PT as 2nd round/undrafted-type talents, then the Warriors would be really comfortable playing more gifted (and frankly higher IQ) guys like the O‚Äôs in those same roles.

You can disagree with the strategy or think it‚Äôs not optimal, but I was giving you the rationale as to why they might do it, and also refuting the notion that they‚Äôre all ‚Äúequally risky‚Äù. Ball and Edawards can rightfully scare some ppl whereas some of those other guys down the board are more like coaches‚Äô dreams."
12484,2020-09-04 00:22:52,ilxboo,"Maybe, but as a Celtics fan I don't really see the similarity between the two players. Theis is much more vertical than Grant."

12486,2020-09-04 04:24:37,ilxboo,"The only possibility of Edwards being ‚Äúriskier‚Äù than the field is if he has attitude problems and doesn‚Äôt buy in to being a role player. Sure, that‚Äôs a risk, but as an outsider, I‚Äôm not in position to comment on character. I trust the Warriors will perform a thorough background check on all players and they‚Äôll be a much better judge of that than me.

But in terms of pure ability, Edwards is undoubtedly the safest pick to be a postseason contributor in his rookie season. He‚Äôs at least as offensively talented as guys like Okoro and Okongwu are defensively, and his athleticism and defensive flashes give him All-NBA Defense potential. It‚Äôs not a matter if he can develop given a few years like with Okoro‚Äôs shot, which is outside of his control. Edwards‚Äôs biggest flaws are purely a matter of want-to and will only exist as long as he allows them to"
12487,2020-09-04 00:33:32,ilxboo,"Theis does a better job with vertical contests and the like, but I bet their actual vertical leap is pretty similar."
12488,2020-09-07 02:37:16,ilxboo,He has shown the ability to not just make the obvious pass but the next one. I think he has a fair shot at it long term. Also Grant is at least Tillman's equal as a passer.
12489,2020-09-04 04:41:40,ilxboo,"My man Edwards is just not a high IQ player in general, it‚Äôs not just about  the ‚Äúwant-to‚Äù. On the ball when he puts in the effort yeah he‚Äôs a plus, but he‚Äôs a bad off-ball defender no matter what right now. I agree about the Warriors being confident in their coaching staff and player development, but it‚Äôs tough to say how quickly Edwards IQ would improve. 

The larger point I was getting about in terms of risk is that Okoro and Okongwu are plug-and-play positives; they wouldn‚Äôt have to change a thing about their games and they‚Äôd be helpful rotation players and could get minutes in the postseason. The risk with them is more in terms of upside (which may not concern the Warriors if they‚Äôre looking at a 2-4year window anyway).

Edwards/Ball, it‚Äôs a lot of projection and talking yourself into how they fit immediately; thats inherently risky. I actually think their upside is less risky, but the short term growing pains would be the issue. 

Not really gonna argue this point myself, but there was an article post on this sub where they interviewed multiple college coaches in the conference about the prospects... multiple SEC coaches favored Okoro to Edwards or pointed out that he affected winning more. Down the road maybe Edwards makes enough improvements to separate himself but **right now** you can argue Okoro helps you win more."

I love Theis, but he's probably among the league leaders in failed lobs per game"
12494,2020-09-07 23:51:02,ilxboo,"Black hole is a very weird descriptor to apply to Grant, to the point that I'm now questioning how much you've watched him play. There have certainly been times where Grant was a net negative offensively, but it was never the case that he was a black hole - [a player where the ball went into his possession and never came back out again, i.e. a selfish player or gunner](https://www.thestepien.com/2019/08/28/draft-notes-black-hole-apocalypse/). That is so far from how Grant has played and occasionally been bad.

He is an ok passer for a big man sure but his passiveness and lack of usage means that it‚Äôs not gonna be shown enough.

Hmm I just disagree, Theis is pretty functional as a rim runner/diver because of his bounce. Grant will never be able to fill that role extensively because he‚Äôs so ground bound. Theis had 81 dunks (to Grant‚Äôs 5) this year, so over 1/gm and in his somewhat limited minutes. Its a pretty big part of his identity as a player

I agree Grants had some impressive contests at the rim but he‚Äôs so heavy he usually needs a wind up. He‚Äôs also about 2‚Äù shorter. He‚Äôs a 4 that can spend some time at the 5 but he‚Äôs fundamentally gonna full a different role than what Theis does for them."

Personally though, I think of Theis' role as defined more by defense than it is offense and that's where Grant can play like Theis. I also think Grant will play his most productive minutes essentially as a 5, primarily guarding the other team's biggest player, with some match up exceptions."

Then the Block by Blockwest project was a completely new vibe compared to everything hes put out recently. He's always changing, and thats what I keeps him authentic to me. If he kept making the same music you know his heart wouldn't be in it and I think the music someone makes should always be a reflection of the artist and just like his music, Oli has changed too.

Who do the Celtics trade for Turner? They'd basically have to trade Hayward to make space. Not that skilled offensively either, Theis is a cheaper option who gives more on that end.

Rockets never trade for Love. Cleveland will need to give a pick or take on something similarly bad to move him most likely.

Toronto won't move on from FVV for replacement level guys, it'd be a major failure if they did. If they don't sign Fred it's because they're looking to rebuild (unlikely) or trying to add a bigger piece.

Highly doubt the Mavs look to trade for someone like Gordon unless it's a great deal, he cannot space the floor for them and regressed this year. Who would they even give up to match Gordon's albatross contract?

Kuzma for Hield would be a complete robbery, but lolkangz. Also the money doesn't make sense again, Kuzma probably stays in LA simply because he's serviceable on a rookie contract.

And with our draft picks, if we're planning to even use all three of them I'd rather we take someone who can space the floor for us. Someone like Vassell, Nesmith, Haliburton, or Saddiq Bey."
12536,2020-09-01 21:34:07,iksqsb,Swing and a miss on the sixers. Trading a young all star for an aging one is not the move.

12538,2020-09-02 00:02:07,iksqsb,Portland Trail Blazers don't have 2 first round picks...
12539,2020-09-01 22:08:03,iksqsb,"The idea that GSW could get John Collins for a PICK SWAP is LOLOLOLOLOLOL

Respectfully the moves for ATL suck. 

The Hawks have spent first round picks on three wings in the last three seasons. Their need isn‚Äôt for another young wing - especially not a project like Okoro who is going to struggle to get minutes until he can start scoring the ball.

The needs for the Hawks is at SG/back-up PG, back-up post, and veteran pieces to win. Green makes sense if the Hawks draft for the guard position (like Halliburton). Otherwise the Hawks should look to a player like Okongwu in the draft and seek a back-up ball handler (assuming they move on from Teague, which isn‚Äôt guaranteed given his decent play from the bench)."
12540,2020-09-01 21:15:16,iksqsb,"I like what you are saying, however I hope we buy a 2nd to get Jalen Mcdaniels if he slips to the second.  Kawhi and PG mentoring him will do wonders.

If Green leaves we should also look to trade Trez in a sign and trade for assets along with creating an exception for 21-22 cap space.

Lastly we should be taking along hard look at Grant along with re signing Morris.

With Trez, Morris and say getting rid of Mcgruder.  That is 26 Mil in available cap room

We could do 13 for both Mook and Grant.

Shamet,PG,Kawhi,Mook,ZU
Pbev, Lou,Mann/Mcdaniels, Grant and Kabengele.

Then you've still got the 5 mil slot  mid level Green leaves if he opts out.

That seems like a better idea than for JJ when Shamet plays the same role.

Great job though and amazing read.  Well done!!"

Ilyasova is only 33 and has a good price. Bucks got Ilyasova and Marvin Williams for that role."
12542,2020-09-01 21:52:48,iksqsb,"For the Mavs: I don't think Bogi is a guy to pay big money. We already have great guard play in Luka, Brunson, Curry, and potentially Trey. Timmy is also most likely opting in so the sg is already filled in. 

I love the potential trade for Gordon though, I've been a proponent for it since Powell went down. He would be a more skilled version of Powell. He would fit seamlessly within this offense and would provide much needed wing defense."

12551,2020-09-01 22:11:10,iksqsb,"I appreciate the amount of time this took. 

As a Laker fan, I don't know about the first one because I'm not too well versed on draft prospects. 

As to the second one, I think Biyombo's a good choice if we get him for cheap, but if not we can always go after someone like Alex Len or Ian Mahinmi. I would also try to re-sign Javale. I know a lot of people shit on him, but I think he's someone the team likes having around. I think he's good for chemistry, and as such, we should try to keep him if possible. 

Last, I don't think we should go for Rose. I'm sure the Pistons would ask for more than we'd be ready to give. Kuz and Caruso might be overrated by Laker fans but they're underrated by other fans. I wouldn't trade either of them for Rose. If possible, I'd wanna see what Dragic, Teague, or Clarkson go for in free agency before making any real moves like that. 

Still, good job coming with so much."

12557,2020-09-02 12:30:33,iksqsb,the Raptors trading for Luke Kennard would be a sight to behold. quite possibly the worst perimeter defender on a defensive team like Toronto.

I might be overrating Embiid, but I just don't think Carter Jr has shown enough to be a center piece in a trade for an All-NBA level player."

12569,2020-09-01 21:23:45,iksqsb,"We actually do have wings once they're healthy.  Ariza and Hood aren't exactly elite, but we're not getting elite.  I see our biggest need as being a starting PF.  Right now I see our healthy rotation looking like this-

PG: Dame - GTJ - Simons

SG: CJ - GTJ

SF: Hood - Ariza - Mario/Little

PF: Collins - Melo

C: Nurk - Collins

Among the starters I think we need a more reliable PF, which would let Collins go back to being a Center."
12570,2020-09-01 21:15:02,iksqsb,I feel like you could‚Äôve used Aminu quite a bit this year tbh
12571,2020-09-01 21:01:09,iksqsb,You could cut Harden

12575,2020-09-01 21:16:02,iksqsb,"he was their best or 2nd best player against us.

Bam got some 3rd team All-NBA votes and Turner was basically just as good that series.

i think Turner has become underrated, no he isnt a top 20 player but he‚Äôs a top 5 C in the modern NBA that requires rim protection, switching, and hitting 3‚Äôs."
12576,2020-09-01 23:08:53,iksqsb,I would like to have him on the Mavs. Not sure if we can get him.
12577,2020-09-01 21:09:01,iksqsb,Turner is the Dollar Store clearance item version of Porzingis
12578,2020-09-01 21:18:53,iksqsb,"Yeah people need to stop acting like Nets are just some farm team to sign talent from, they‚Äôre trying to be contenders just as much as anyone. No way do they let a shooter like Joe Harris just walk without putting up a serious fight for him, he is going to be so valuable for their spacing when KD and Kyrie are back."
12579,2020-09-01 21:39:37,iksqsb,I don't think it's likely but the Celtics could potentially have some space to make moves if Hayward decides to opt out.
12580,2020-09-01 23:27:00,iksqsb,As a Grizzlies fan maybe I should be thankful to be neglected altogether from these terrible suggestions.
12581,2020-09-03 16:16:53,iksqsb,"Question, you don‚Äôt have bird rights so how are you going to keep Mook when you are well over the cap? you‚Äôll only have the mid level in the off season and no picks unless you trade Zubac or Pat who have some salary weight"
12582,2020-09-03 18:19:55,iksqsb,"This one made me scratch my head, DSJ is a huge downgrade on Conley, the Jazz would not even consider that move. If they had to trade for a Knicks guard I think Ntilikina would fit their roster better, he would be nice paired with Mitchell and Conley, bringing size and defense. I don't know what they would give back."
12583,2020-09-01 21:14:16,iksqsb,nice contribution
12584,2020-09-01 22:58:03,iksqsb,"You're absolutely right, I would be livid if we traded Embiid for WCJ and didn't get at least Markannen and more"
12585,2020-09-02 09:08:18,iksqsb,I don't know if you know but CJ McCollum is likely available and we need someone like Simmons bad
12586,2020-09-01 21:04:33,iksqsb,I think I‚Äôd prefer the bad joke
12587,2020-09-01 21:05:53,iksqsb,"Joke, not the First time it happened"
12588,2020-09-01 22:09:10,iksqsb,"And people seem to think we'll do it without them, despite failing to do so in the 80s, 90s, and 00s for some reason.

I'll keep my franchise guys and enjoy them while they're here and cross my fingers for 2023 onward."
12589,2020-09-02 09:04:22,iksqsb,Therefore we need more wings. I think in the NBA today Collins best fit is going to be the 5. So we need wings who can play the 4/3 because Mario getting minutes is not it and as much as I like Little I don't think he's ready to play minutes for a team trying to contend.

12593,2020-09-01 21:21:11,iksqsb,Turner is ass at offense. Advanced numbers are awful.
12594,2020-09-01 21:17:51,iksqsb,"i mean he‚Äôs also payed $12M per season less than Porzingis and doesnt have injury concerns

Turner is one of the few C‚Äôs that can shoot 3‚Äôs, defend the paint, screen, and switch onto SF/PF‚Äôs."
12595,2020-09-03 16:22:27,iksqsb,"We have Mook on early bird.  The most we could offer is 18 mil.  His salary is 15 now which we did open up with the trade from Harkless.  We also have almost 6 mil in trade exceptions.

We do not have picks to trade but do have cash to buy in.  For the future we also have our 21, 23 and 25.  The latter as pick swaps.

For Trez we could easily sign and trade for assets.  We also do not have a mid level if Green opts in.  Only vet minimums.  We still have some decent wiggle room thanks to Winger being a cap savant."
12596,2020-09-01 21:23:39,iksqsb,"Never said he was a world beater, but your wing depth and defense was atrocious this year and I think Aminu could‚Äôve helped out a lot there off the bench"
12597,2020-09-02 09:06:03,iksqsb,They were atrocious but their defense would have been helpful. If nothing else they could've been bodies to throw at Lebron instead on Melo and GTJ

Interesting to see which teams would do the sign and trade but I don‚Äôt see him going to a contender, it will be super interesting as the Lakers too will be looking actively for role players and they have more wiggle room"
12601,2020-09-02 13:37:19,iksqsb,They were outplayed on both ends by Hood and Collins. Who are still here (and injured):
12602,2020-09-01 23:13:21,iksqsb,-2.36 O-RPM. He also makes a lot of dumb plays and generally just doesn‚Äôt impact the game a whole lot. He‚Äôs a good rim protector but he gets bodied by the upper echelon of bigs.
12603,2020-09-01 23:46:45,iksqsb,He‚Äôs only a marginal upgrade on defense though. Theis is straight up a better player on a better contract
12604,2020-09-03 16:40:07,iksqsb,"Absolutely!!  What's fascinating and I got downvoted to shit is our 21-22 salary and holds.  If you have time check that out.  Depending on what we do with Morris..personally I think we should do a 1 year deal.  PG and Kawhis cap hold when they opt out is 37.5 and 36.5 mil.  Pbev is at 14 and ZU is 7.  The rest is Landry Shamet, Mann and Kabengele.  They could conceivably have enough to get Giannis.  Between PG, Kawhi and Giannis that is 108.5 mil.  Projected cap is 126 mil.

Depending on what we do with Trez, which I think is a sign and trade for a pick to open up at 15-20 mil exception.  If we do that this off season and sign 1 year deals, we could be a player.  Only reason I say that is that for 2 years prior our contracts lined up for last summer.

Our contracts now shape up for The summer of 21-22.  Most likely a pipe dream but something interesting to think about.

The Lakers definitely have some wiggle room to upgrade as well."

Here's one from last year

[https://globalmedia-it.com/USA/millennials-are-not-the-black-sheep-of-generations/](https://globalmedia-it.com/USA/millennials-are-not-the-black-sheep-of-generations/)

It's a definition that will probably never die off, since it begins at 1961 (the second most popular starting point for gen x) and goes all the way to the end of the 70s."
12624,2020-09-02 00:53:21,ikfnvk,"I found one with 1999-2015: 
http://www.sjassociates.com/blogs/infoMatters/generation_z"
12625,2020-09-01 00:32:17,ik450s,"god I will quit being a hornets fan if they actually pick toppin at 3. Deni, Ball, Onyeka, and even Hayes are better than toppin"
12626,2020-08-31 19:03:37,ik450s,"Does anyone know what's happens on LaMelo Ball, Theo Maledon and Jalen Smith ?  
Why Kevin O'Connor give Obi Toppin to Hornets, They already have PJ Washington ?"
12627,2020-08-31 21:18:55,ik450s,Going the Michael Jordan loves All-Americans route I see.
12628,2020-08-31 20:20:35,ik450s,No way he drops that far during the draft. Also why draft Nico when Riller is there?
12629,2020-09-01 03:35:44,ik450s,I would do backflips if Killian Hayes dropped one spot further to the Spurs
12630,2020-09-01 15:16:54,ik450s,"Just saw it and considered posting. Taking Toppin at 3 would be wild, plus Ball at 7? I think the Bulls would have to take him at 4 if his avaliable. Other picks that caught me off guard: Achiuwa-WAS, Cole Anthony-SAC, Mannion-PHI, P. Williams falling to 22 (I like him at 16 to POR better than Hampton)."
12631,2020-08-31 23:38:54,ik450s,"I haven‚Äôt seen too many takes with Ball outside the top 3, but my own personal draft board coincides with this:  

Tier 1: Wiseman/Edwards  
Tier 2: Hayes/Avdija/Toppin/Ball/Okongwu/Haliburton
  
I would be surprised if Ball fell below #8, but it‚Äôs refreshing to see a new take"
12632,2020-08-31 21:58:29,ik450s,"This is the draft still isn't for 2 more months boredom edition..

No way it plays out like this but these guys always have to throw out some random mock at some point to get some views.  It gets fans of Detroit and the Knicks thinking someone like Ball might drop but it never actually happens."
12633,2020-09-01 04:37:08,ik450s,I would be livid if the Hawks past on Melo.
12634,2020-09-01 05:15:35,ik450s,"While unlikely, Ball dropping to 5 or lower is not crazy. It's a bad draft at the top, but it could be a really fun TV show in October!"
12635,2020-09-01 12:28:09,ik450s,Nico fucking Mannion again at 21. Why???
12636,2020-09-01 13:39:59,ik450s,"if you believe Obi (or anyone else somewhat unexpected) pops into the top 4, its not all that surprising that LaMelo would drop to 7.  Can't see CLE and ATL taking him.  That would seem like his floor."
12637,2020-08-31 20:03:29,ik450s,Nah. This ain‚Äôt it. And some said my mock was questionable. Please let me know what you think of this.
12638,2020-09-01 11:38:19,ik450s,I agree 100%. If we can't get Wiseman I honestly would love having Onyeka. But I also understand we have to take the BPA.
12639,2020-09-01 12:27:41,ik450s,Halliburton as well. Have no faith Toppin will be a net positive contributor because of his atrocious defense
12640,2020-09-01 19:15:20,ik450s,"This is the most logical mock I've seen yet.   Even though it has my Pistons drafting Ball, which makes sense because we're one of the worst organizations in all of sports, but infuriates me, because Ball is a guaranteed bust.  And not worthy of a first round pick.

As for your Hornets.  Just looking at your draft history, the is a 0% chance you guys are taking Ball, and Hayes and Deni are probably out as well.  

If I was a betting man, Cole Anthony and Toppin are very high on the Hornets draft board."
12641,2020-09-02 13:09:45,ik450s,What is with the hate for Toppin on this sub jfc
12642,2020-08-31 19:14:21,ik450s,"> Until the draft picture is clear my mocks will explore possible draft night scenarios. What if a team trades? What if a player rises?

12643,2020-08-31 20:47:52,ik450s,"Obi to the Hornets has gotten buzz (no pun intended) because of their history of going after older, successful college players."
12644,2020-09-01 15:00:07,ik450s,O‚ÄôConnor wants Charlotte to have the worst defense of all time
12645,2020-09-01 23:40:02,ik450s,this guy gets paid to drive clicks
12646,2020-08-31 19:29:09,ik450s,"If they see Obi as the best talent, then fit doesn't usually matter, especially at #3."
12647,2020-09-01 15:00:54,ik450s,"Nico better playmaker, right?"
12648,2020-09-02 00:42:55,ik450s,I would do more than backflips for Vassell.
12649,2020-09-01 19:19:08,ik450s,"I'm from Detroit, and trust me, no one there would be excited about this pick"
12650,2020-09-09 20:28:43,ik450s,I would be livid if the Hawks waste a pick on Lamelo
12651,2020-09-01 19:53:48,ik450s,"Our GM already said that we are going BPA, and Toppin is not that especially at 3"
12652,2020-08-31 19:20:29,ik450s,"I really appreciate KOC. The draft will get extra dull with the extra 5 months when everyone posts a new mock where the only differentiation is one or two things like ""I wanted to mix it up, so I had the Celtics take Saddiq Bey instead of Nesmith."""
12653,2020-08-31 19:26:51,ik450s,"I mean do you hear any rumors ?  
If this is just his assumption, then I want to understand why."
12654,2020-09-01 15:34:38,ik450s,"He is, but there are better playmakers that will be there maybe in the 2nd round. Malachi Flynn is one who I think is a better playmaker, and prospect right now that Nico."
12655,2020-09-01 21:26:49,ik450s,"Well, its top 3 on their board.  For all we know their top 3 could be Toppin, Anthony, and Maxey.  And any other 3 players in any other order.  There are no Simmons, Davis, or Towns in this draft."
12656,2020-08-31 19:38:20,ik450s,"I don't know why they always like to give Isaiah Stewart to Celtics #26 or #30 .  
I think he too slow may can't play PF, if as Center too undersize.  
I would prefer Xavier Tillman or Zeke Nnaji on #30 .  
Robert Williams aslo good, just like his Game 1 on Raptors yesterday."
12657,2020-08-31 20:11:03,ik450s,"Says it at the top: 

>This week, he‚Äôs breaking down how the draft could play out if projected top prospect LaMelo Ball falls out of the top five. While everyone around the league recognizes Ball's premier passing talents as a 6-foot-7 point guard, executives and scouts have mixed opinions on his actual upside due to his flaws as a defender and as a shooter. Several executives even have him ranked outside of their top 10. If LaMelo falls, who rises? How might the board change? Let‚Äôs get into it.

Who knows who these executives and scouts are though."
12658,2020-08-31 19:52:29,ik450s,"That‚Äôs the thing.  These aren‚Äôt even rumors ( maybe some are but not many).  Even if he did have inside info from certain teams , those teams knowing he will put out what they say will likely give misinformation.   They‚Äôll tell him about players they like (likely guys they won‚Äôt touch) and downgrade others."
12659,2020-08-31 20:33:12,ik450s,Thank you

12668,2020-08-30 02:12:20,ij3hhq,"Thank you, I just don‚Äôt understand why people overlook or under credit him for literally playing a character within these surprisingly intricate and creative narratives he crafts with every album just as Kanye or Tyler does to just as much of an extreme."

12670,2020-08-30 11:09:50,ij3hhq,its just wrong
12671,2020-08-30 16:39:24,ij3hhq,"I completely respect your opinion! However, I can‚Äôt respect ERYS as much as his other projects because it bites Travis Scott a little too much, and is just a little too artificial for me. He can only rap about pink pistols and drip so much before it becomes too obnoxious for me to enjoy lol. CTV2 however is extremely poetic front to back, had some Bino Camp influence on Fire with a youthful twist, I take into consideration the age at which he made that project, PCH was beautiful, Keep Ya Love was beautiful and catchy, Zoned was so poetic and smooth, Symba was incredible, he discusses his parents fighting and the ADHD he suffers from which is a little too relatable for me lol, beautifully depicts young heartbreak on the fucking monster that is Let It Breathe, Electric was sooo smooth, Young and Reckless was boom bap and dope asf. All the loosies that we‚Äôre made around that era leading up to SYRE were INCREDIBLE and added even more to that time period."
12672,2020-08-31 02:23:09,ij3hhq,I see where your coming from tho
12673,2020-08-30 18:57:43,ij3hhq,I do think CTV2 is amazing but overall i think ERYS is better. Anyway we will agree to disagree i guess

12698,2020-10-10 17:34:21,j8ikov,Why the fuck are y‚Äôall picking Carey
12699,2020-10-10 12:54:31,j8ikov,It‚Äôs really too bad that Killian Tillie didn‚Äôt fall to this pick. Even with the health concerns there‚Äôs not a better fit in the draft.
12700,2020-10-10 17:18:18,j8ikov,They already have okafor do they really need another player who‚Äôs been consistently comped to him
12701,2020-10-10 18:00:36,j8ikov,I feel like people are just voting for names they recognize rather than considering team specific needs.
12702,2020-10-10 13:37:32,j8ikov,DO NOT TAKE MY VERNON GUY!!!
12703,2020-10-10 23:54:09,j8ikov,"Derrick Favors may be out the door. Wide body to provide a change up from Jaxson Hayes. Some potential as an outside shooter. And like the other dude said, he‚Äôs just BPA at this point. Maybe he‚Äôs not a great fit for the league these days, but maybe he adapts enough that you get a starting caliber C in the second round"
12704,2020-10-10 20:45:26,j8ikov,He's overwhelmingly the BPA here.
12705,2020-10-10 13:30:02,j8ikov,Malachi Flynn with the Sixers is a better fit tbh.
12706,2020-10-10 18:05:57,j8ikov,"i think Okoro is the exact guy the Cavs are needing. but you‚Äôre right, Tillie would be great here"
12707,2020-10-10 17:34:44,j8ikov,Ppl here must not watch the NBA
12708,2020-10-10 18:29:31,j8ikov,"Yeah, personally I think the last thing the pels need is a 5 who can't shoot it consistently or defend."
12709,2020-10-10 19:17:21,j8ikov,Drafting for needs at the 39th pick probably isn‚Äôt wise either.
12710,2020-10-10 19:56:04,j8ikov,"I would rather that we take Daniel Oturu.

Fits the same need, but better all around prospect, IMO."
12711,2020-10-10 14:32:34,j8ikov,"Lol, I guess we did have a chance at him falling to us. At least we might be one of Carey Jr or Reggie Perry. I like both of them."
12712,2020-10-11 00:20:06,j8ikov,"Sam Merrill is a wayyy better player and a much more valuable player than Carey. I‚Äôm sure there are others. A traditional center that can‚Äôt defend and can‚Äôt stretch the floor will never be BPA, what‚Äôs the upside? He plays 10 a minutes a night for you sometimes in the regular season?"
12713,2020-10-10 21:00:01,j8ikov,Him being BPA here doesn‚Äôt change the fact he won‚Äôt get any minutes and is a terrible fit on this pels team.
12714,2020-10-10 13:35:54,j8ikov,"Eh, agree to disagree there. The pelicans are hurting for a stretch big whereas the sixers have a lot of guys already that could minimize Flynn‚Äôs role (Simmons, shake). I still really like Flynn but I don‚Äôt really like the philly fit like everyone is touting"
12715,2020-10-10 23:55:24,j8ikov,Yeah no one on this nba topic sub watches the NBA lets just go with thatü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
12716,2020-10-10 23:26:07,j8ikov,Drafting for need in general isn‚Äôt a wise move. Unless everything else is equal.
12717,2020-10-10 20:00:14,j8ikov,"Wouldn't mind him. He's my alternative to Carey.
Oh, check out my last post, just posted, on r/NBASpurs where I talk about it way better."
12718,2020-10-10 14:41:10,j8ikov,I'm doing that post I was talking about exactly right now lol. I'll post it as soon as possible üôè
12719,2020-10-11 01:47:23,j8ikov,"He doesn‚Äôt stretch the floor *yet*. I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôll be shooting the 3 in the league. The upside in him is that he realizes early on that he‚Äôs not going to be the focal point of any offense so he starts tapping into his ancillary skills to fit in. He will probably always struggle sliding his feet to cut off penetration, but he could be a solid rim protector (he‚Äôs bouncier than he gets credit for, and his frame should be tough to finish thru).

I think the likely scenario is that he‚Äôs your typical 8/4 bench big in ~15 min, but he was ranked pretty highly in HS for a reason. Not just for parking himself in the paint and putting the ball thru the hoop. The main issue is whether he figures out how to not get picked apart on defense"
12720,2020-10-10 13:46:59,j8ikov,"Simmons would maximize Flynn if anything. Simmons is a terrific PnR roll man and Flynn is the best PnR ball handler in the class plus an amazing shooter (something you need to insulate Simmons with).

Flynn adds shooting, which the Sixers need desperately. Ball handling in the half court, which the Sixers need desperately. Perimeter playmaking, which the Sixers need desperately. A competent PnR partner for Simmons/Horford. Which the Sixers need desperately. A handoff partner for Embiid, which the Sixers need desperately, I could go on.

Of course he's not going to be a superstar in all these rolls, but he does everything that the Sixers are currently missing. He's at the very least going to be a bench guy on the Sixers purely out of his fit alone with the rest of the team."
12721,2020-10-11 01:26:40,j8ikov,They must not if they think Vernon Carey Jr is a good fit with the Pelicans.
12722,2020-10-11 02:51:56,j8ikov,"You can get that guy anywhere though, Joakim Noah can still get you that and he doesn‚Äôt even play. I just don‚Äôt see the point in investing a draft pick in him"
12723,2020-10-10 15:32:06,j8ikov,"Yeah Flynn would be fantastic. can never have enough ball handling. Adding Flynn and hopefully moving Richardson for a Schroder type (or a bigger trade for CP3 üëÄ) would give the Sixers Simmons-CP3-Flynn, and Shake can be a decent ancillary ball handler that can still excel off the ball. I think Flynn can contribute reasonably soon"
12724,2020-10-10 17:25:18,j8ikov,"I genuinely agree with all of these things. He‚Äôs a good shooter and ball handler, Simmons is a good roll man and he‚Äôs a decent piece for them. My worry is that he won‚Äôt get a ton of touches and I think this neuters him. Is he really a good enough spot up shooter to be off ball for ~70% of the time he‚Äôs on the floor.

I don‚Äôt really know why I‚Äôm arguing this but here goes. Tillie would stretch the floor and allow a ton of room for Zion and Ingram drives and he‚Äôs genuinely one of the most talented players in this class it‚Äôs just the health and age concerns. I‚Äôm not actually opposed to Flynn on Philly I‚Äôm just not as giddy as others are."
12725,2020-10-11 11:01:03,j8ikov,"I just said what the upside in him in is, he‚Äôd potentially be a dynamite bench big or Enes Kanter with a 3 ball. It‚Äôs a healthy risk-reward where the downside is that you still probably get a rotation player. Most 2nd round picks amount to nothing anyway, we‚Äôre not talking about taking him in the lottery."
12726,2020-10-10 15:41:54,j8ikov,"Yeah, we put Shake in as a primary ball handler right away this season even though he was very clearly not prepared for it because we literally had no-one else to do it.

Even if Flynn isn't great he'll still be a *massive* improvement from the guys we had this year lol."
12727,2020-10-10 18:26:02,j8ikov,"I mean of course he won't be perfectly utilized in the starting lineup as is, no player would be. But the thing I have with Tillie is that he's such an amazing fit on *any* team on the league just because of how damn talented and versatile he is. It's almost like saying ""Zion is a perfect fit with X team"", so I'm inclined to not agree so much. 

Tillie is the perfect modern 4. I feel like he's no better of a fit in New Orleans than he is in, say, Boston."
12728,2020-10-10 15:55:13,j8ikov,"You ain‚Äôt lyin. 

if they do decide to to wing, I‚Äôd put Isaiah Joe number 1 on my board among his peers, but I honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really that big of a hole for us. Simmons is Simmons, Tobias will be back, and Furk and Thybulle should be"
12729,2020-10-10 17:10:15,j8ikov,"If we're guaranteed to get Flynn I like Joe.

If there's going to be a Herro-like player in this draft it would be him."
12730,2020-10-09 12:08:56,j7wr46,I am weak that this sub gave the Knicks Riller & Mannion
12731,2020-10-09 14:09:41,j7wr46,"Wow the fact that his sub voted for us to take Mannion makes me really sad. Just ask us Knick fans what our team needs, because Mannion is not it.

Especially when we already have 3 PG's DSJ, Frank, and now Riller with this mock. 

Can someone who voted for Mannion explain their reasoning???"
12732,2020-10-09 11:50:47,j7wr46,"I think the success of the heat and Celtics in the playoffs this year proved just how important it was to have wings. The pelicans are off to a good start with Ingram and Zion but I still think they need 1-2 more guys.

So give me Josh Hall here. I know it may seem like somewhat of a reach but he‚Äôs the perfect type of guy to play in a switching scheme with Zion and Ingram. He‚Äôs very long and has a great frame that will be easy to fill out (and physical sturdiness is one of the most underrated aspects of a prospect IMO). I think he will be at least a league average shooter in the long term and is just a great high potential swing for the fences type pick. 

(PS. I hate the Cole Anthony pick here even though I‚Äôm sorta in on him but I digress)"
12733,2020-10-09 12:09:02,j7wr46,"holy crap this mock draft sucks for the knicks. vassell is ok but they pass up on bey, reed, and joe for grant riller just to end up with mannion."
12734,2020-10-09 14:12:40,j7wr46,"im SO disappointed in y‚Äôall for mocking us Nico Mannion

he‚Äôs terrible"
12735,2020-10-09 11:37:16,j7wr46,"Not sure I can like the Cole Anthony pick. Kira Lewis? Poku? Hell I‚Äôd rather we reach on Riller.

Nico Mannion is fine here at least."
12736,2020-10-09 19:44:22,j7wr46,"I think their priority is shooting at the 5 spot to free up Zion, So I guess Isaiah Stewart here, but maybe another wing like Elijah Hughes."
12737,2020-10-09 13:54:02,j7wr46,"Might be a reach, but I went with Payton Pritchard. Pelicans could use a backup  PG and I think Cassius Winston might be too short for the NBA."
12738,2020-10-09 19:59:34,j7wr46,"CAREY???????

Oh hell nah, now I know y‚Äôall have no idea who you‚Äôre picking. Nico was bad but back to back picks that make no sense? ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
12739,2020-10-09 20:23:43,j7wr46,Gotta be Stanley or Carey here. Duke South must live on lol
12740,2020-10-09 15:22:32,j7wr46,Manion shoulda went here
12741,2020-10-09 16:07:22,j7wr46,I went with Myles Powell here. Another bucket that can space the floor. Second unit ball handler potentially.
12742,2020-10-09 14:11:41,j7wr46,im so disappointed

12759,2020-10-09 19:48:03,j7wr46,"We handled that by drafting Riller. If he doesn't work out, we can always draft another point guard next year. Drafting 2 point guards in one year, however, is overkill - especially when they arent lottery talents"
12760,2020-10-09 19:50:01,j7wr46,Idk if Riller is ever a starter on a good team. I hate that we took Mannion too tho.
12761,2020-10-08 18:46:08,j7g3oo,Oh WOW what a great lineup!!!!
12762,2020-10-08 17:02:16,j7azdi,"Shooting is still our #1 priority, and there's no such thing as too many wings, so after Riller my goal would be a wing with shooting + as many other skills as I can get. 

Ty-shon Alexander is my pick here. 

Great shooter, tough defender, can do a little with the ball to. Nothing spectacular, but his NBA comp from several people has been Kentavious Caldwell Pope, who's about to be the pivot guy that gets the Lakers a title."
12763,2020-10-08 18:45:29,j7azdi,"I think Knick haters might be taking a piss by giving us Nico here. Haven't we been through enough as Knick fans?  Have some mercy here. Why on earth would we take Nico when we've already drafted Riller at 27?  Not to mention, if you're going to grab a shooting point, Winston is much better."
12764,2020-10-08 11:55:28,j7azdi,"Surprised Nico Mannion is available on #38 .  
But NYK already have Grant Riller at #27.  
Who will start if they get two PG ?"
12765,2020-10-08 16:03:15,j7azdi,Cassius Stanley imo offers the most upside for the team and offers great defense so he should be the pick. But looks like everyone is forcing a 2nd pg pick on us
12766,2020-10-08 19:21:38,j7azdi,"if y‚Äôall have us picking Nico, im gonna be disappointed

EDIT: GODDAMN"
12767,2020-10-08 16:47:57,j7azdi,Have them taking a swing on Stanley. Would also accept Vernon Carey or Nwora
12768,2020-10-08 19:34:54,j7azdi,"The fact that people voted Nico here just shows they don't know anything about the Knicks. Nico ain't it. We need someone at the 4 that can shoot, or another 2 that can stretch the floor. We don't have the minutes to give Frank, Riller in this scenario, Nico, and Dennis Smith Jr minutes.

Jordan Nwora and Ty Alexander are two great picks here"
12769,2020-10-08 19:42:15,j7azdi,Why are y‚Äôall picking Nico
12770,2020-10-08 14:09:48,j7azdi,Nwora imo
12771,2020-10-08 16:24:50,j7azdi,Elijah Hughes maybe.
12772,2020-10-08 20:03:20,j7azdi,Y‚Äôall need to understand that Mannion is not good at all lmao
12773,2020-10-08 20:16:45,j7azdi,"I went Stanley, elite athlete. Good enough shooter, seems to play smart. He is a great fit and in my opinion BPA"
12774,2020-10-08 17:03:45,j7azdi,Scrubb or Stanley is my pick here
12775,2020-10-08 17:36:52,j7azdi,Went with Stanley here.  Probably the best upside at a low value spot.
12776,2020-10-08 22:01:13,j7azdi,Why is Nico winning lol this must be a joke
12777,2020-10-08 11:32:15,j7azdi,Mason Jones!

Hughes- 

Compact NBA stroke 

Has flashed NBA range

Also flashed plus athleticism and fluidity; I pay attention when I see elevator finishes off two feet and one foot. He had single leg finishes off right and left no less.

Quite a few flash plays as a shot blocker, maybe untapped defensive upside because of ‚Äòcuse 2-3"
12779,2020-10-08 12:23:05,j7azdi,Boston will not pick poku.

12785,2020-10-08 19:25:14,j7azdi,seriously why is Nico winning
12786,2020-10-08 12:23:32,j7azdi,"Riller obv. Nico isn't NBA ready yet but he was the 6th ranked recruit for a reason, so this is really an upside play if I've ever seen one.

I think it also just helps New York lay out the patchwork of a supporting cast for a star if they ever get one."
12787,2020-10-08 19:21:06,j7azdi,"I'm not really surprised. Bad frame, bad first step, bad penetrator, bad finisher, bad defender, not a great shooter. The only plus tool he showed was passing.  His shot needs to be so much better than he showed for him to even be a back end NBA rotation player. He's low floor, low ceiling. I'd much rather have Winston. At least we know he can shoot. I think ideally, in 2 years, Nico becomes as good as Winston is now. I don't get Nico at all."
12788,2020-10-08 14:06:45,j7azdi,"Tbh Frank probably starts over Riller for the start of the season. But Nico isn't the pick here. Jordan Nwora would be a good pick here, put him at the back up 4"
12789,2020-10-08 18:22:51,j7azdi,Kinda doubt Nico falls this low after all this Herro hype.

All I'd be happy to have there, but most of them are gone and since we got Riller at 27, Winston would be kind of a duplication there so I'd def take Stanley. Great kid, hard worker, elite athlete. He should be a really nice, switchable 3 and D rotation guy."
12796,2020-10-08 20:04:33,j7azdi,This mock has been going on for over a month now while Terry‚Äôs stock was still firmly in the late teens-early 20‚Äôs

12801,2020-10-08 18:46:09,j7azdi,"What the hell does Tyler Herro have in common with Nico Mannion? Herro shot .462/.355/.935 in college, is three inches taller than Nico, and is significantly more athletic."
12802,2020-10-08 13:38:03,j7azdi,"If Boston had a different coach and different roster construction you‚Äôd be right. Absolutely would not trust us with Poku. Would be a waste of talent. 

As a Boston fan I‚Äôll tell you right now that Brad Stevens wouldn‚Äôt develop Poku. He‚Äôd rot on our bench because unless you contribute right away in some fashion, Brad won‚Äôt play you. 

Even players that are ready to be rotation players get shafted for dudes like Wannamaker, Semi, and Kanter."
12803,2020-10-08 15:38:21,j7azdi,Poku is tall yes but skinny. I understand Celtics need a center but at this point Robert Williams makes a leap or they trade for one. This draft is guard heavy and the Celtics need a backup to Kemba/ scoring off the bench. Poku is just not for them at this time. Maybe at 26 or 30 but definitely not 14
12804,2020-10-11 18:14:50,j7azdi,I think they should trade down for Aaron Nesmith
12805,2020-10-08 18:53:50,j7azdi,"Yeah i agree with you, but I've been seeing some draft boards compare him to Tyler Herro, Landry Shamet and Derrick White. Feel like it most has to do with him being a crafty White dude lol"
12806,2020-10-08 13:42:47,j7azdi,"That's not really a good reason to pass up a guy with one of the highest ceilings in the draft at the end of the lottery.

If we learned anything from Giannis it's just how massive of rewards you can reap from a young, high ceiling prospect. If Poku can be put on an excellent weight training program (which I have no doubts that Boston could do), you could end up with one of the best players to come out of this draft, and the prospect of that alone is more than enough for me to justify any team, especially a team with as little to lose as Boston, taking Poku at 14."
12807,2020-10-08 13:57:15,j7azdi,">unless you contribute right away in some fashion, Brad won‚Äôt play you.

As it should be. Are you really suggesting that he should be playing guys like Tremont Waters, Carson Edwards or Romeo Langford extended minutes over the vets that are getting the job done? This team is basically good enough to get to the Finals and maybe win it all, this ain‚Äôt the time for development."
12808,2020-10-08 15:39:26,j7azdi,Poku isn't a center. He just has the highest ceiling in the draft.
12809,2020-10-11 18:17:32,j7azdi,Why? If you're not getting him with your 27th pick I don't think you should be entertaining the thought of picking Nesmith. It's just bad value otherwise.
12810,2020-10-08 19:23:54,j7azdi,"that‚Äôs exactly why 

like how people compare Poku to Porzingis"
12811,2020-10-08 13:48:53,j7azdi,"I don‚Äôt think Poku develops without game reps, and I don‚Äôt think Boston gets Poku any game reps in the next few years. Brad Stevens is not a good developmental coach IMO. 

I think being stuck in the G league would be horrible for Poku. 

Maxey likely returns more value for Boston. 

In a vacuum your reasoning is sound, i just can‚Äôt get behind it knowing what I know about how Stevens handles prospects, especially while we are trying to contend with an aging Kemba and Hayward."
12812,2020-10-08 14:15:39,j7azdi,">As it should be. Are you really suggesting that he should be playing guys like Tremont Waters, Carson Edwards or Romeo Langford extended minutes over the vets that are getting the job done?

Guys like Edwards and Waters shouldn‚Äôt even be on the roster, but Langford? Yes he should have been getting consistent minutes all season. He‚Äôs better than Wannamaker and Ojeleye. 

>This team is basically good enough to get to the Finals and maybe win it all, this ain‚Äôt the time for development.

Except the team is not good enough, largely due to the fact that a large portion of our bench minutes go towards 2 horrible players in Semi and Kanter, and Wannamaker (mediocre SG miscast as a PG)

Development is necessary. Guys like Robert Williams and Grant Williams are not only currently better than Kanter, but they also are much more important to the franchise. 

There‚Äôs absolutely no excuse for someone as gifted as Robert Williams to have played a total of 671 career minutes in 2 years, especially when you consider the Celtics are desperate for a viable big in the long and short term. Just as there was also no excuse for Grant being buried behind Kanter and Ojeleye all year."
12813,2020-10-08 15:42:08,j7azdi,Okay but the Celtics aren‚Äôt going to draft him at 14
12814,2020-10-08 13:55:01,j7azdi,"Poku needs muscle first and foremost. Game reps won't mean anything until this gets sorted out.

But I don't think the G league is as useless as you're making it seem. It'll be a really good way for Poku to solidfy his decision making skills that he's flashed.

I don't think it matters how good of a developmental coach your coach is, if you have a prospect like Poku staring you down at 14 you almost have to take him no matter what. Especially considering how comfortable Boston should be with making mistakes. If, even despite Brad Stevens, Poku hits a high end outcome Boston now has a complete stranglehold on the league. That wouldn't happen with Maxey, and I think that's a really important thing to consider."
12815,2020-10-08 14:45:31,j7azdi,That‚Äôs why they created the g leauge to get reps when your not nba ready. So Brad gets no credit for the constant improvement of Marcus jaylen Jayson and timelord?
12816,2020-10-08 14:40:27,j7azdi,"I like Romeo but he‚Äôs not really ready yet (needs to get his 3 ball right) and his biggest value on the floor rn is defensively. Wanamaker was really good this year and maybe even better in the playoffs. Ojeleye plays a different position/role so it‚Äôs not really fair to say he‚Äôs taking Romeos minutes. 

And the team wasn‚Äôt good enough?? That Miami series could‚Äôve went either way man and the Celtics actually outplayed them for a majority of the minutes in the first 2 games despite going down 2-0. This team is relatively young but thinking too much about the future isn‚Äôt wise when they‚Äôre right on the cusp and capable of winning RIGHT NOW.

>Development is necessary. Guys like Robert Williams and Grant Williams are not only currently better than Kanter, but they also are much more important to the franchise.

And I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre really going on about because Grant has literally closed multiple games at the 5 and Brad isn‚Äôt afraid to play him. He also gets more minutes than Ojelye? Also again they have different roles slightly

Rob Will, similarly replaced Kanter in the rotation at some points in the playoffs. Just thrusting young guys into the lineup for the sake of development isn‚Äôt wise for a team this good, you play them as they can contribute.

‚ÄúA bird in hand is worth two in the bush‚Äù. They shouldn‚Äôt be taking for granted how good they are and saying ‚Äúwe should develop these guys so we can win in 3-5 years‚Äù. You also rightfully pointed out, Kemba is aging and Hayward is a question mark. Brad should be coaching for the now, not development"
12817,2020-10-08 15:46:55,j7azdi,"And yet they should.

If Poku hits his ceiling him and Tatum are going to be completely unstoppable, there is no way for a team to compete with those two with a supporting cast of Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, Grant Williams and older Kemba and Hayward plus any other guys currently in their developmental pipeline.

There has never been a player Poku's height with such a complete package of perimeter skills at the same age."
12818,2020-10-08 14:05:53,j7azdi,"I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm as high on you as Poku, I have him above Maxey from a ceiling standpoint, but he‚Äôs not less likely to reach it. 

He needs a ton of work on defense and as a decision maker. His frame can support some more weight, but he‚Äôs got thin hips and shoulders and a super high center of gravity. Strength will likely always be an issue. I don‚Äôt see how he ever reliably plays the 5. I see him as a giant point forward. I worry about how his already sub par athleticism will handle additional weight. 

If everything hits then yeah Poku is a super valuable unicorn. I know you keep mentioning how a team like Boston can afford to take a chance on that, but I disagree. I don‚Äôt think the Celtics are really in as great a spot as people say. They really need to contend now, and using your last real draft asset on a guy who likely won‚Äôt contribute for 2 years is a tough sell when a guy like Maxey could be there."

And for most teams it doesn‚Äôt do an adequate job at serving its purpose, the Raptors are the exception.  

>So Brad gets no credit for the constant improvement of Marcus jaylen Jayson and timelord?

Uh, No? Why should he? Timelord has played 617 minutes in 2 years, and played a total of 29 games this year, that‚Äôs pathetic given our big rotation.

Jaylen and Jayson deserve the credit for taking it upon themselves to improve, they‚Äôre the ones who put the work in, not Brad. If anything Tatum and Brown were both stunted by Brad last year because Brad refused to set an offensive hierarchy that would‚Äôve let them flourish. Instead they were fighting bums like Marcus Morris and Terry Rozier for touches. Brown wasn‚Äôt even starting because Brad decided to sit him in favor of Morris because Brown tried to play through plantar fasciitis and an injury to his shooting hand."
12820,2020-10-08 15:02:10,j7azdi,"Im sorry but a lot of this is just wrong. 


>I like Romeo but he‚Äôs not really ready yet (needs to get his 3 ball right) and his biggest value on the floor rn is defensively. 

Romeo doesn‚Äôt need a 3 to be an effective player. He‚Äôs already one of the best PnR players and finishers on the team. He should have been ahead of Wannamaker all regular season. 

>Wanamaker was really good this year and maybe even better in the playoffs. 

Wannamaker is solid, but he‚Äôs not the answer. A back up PG should be able to run the offense for the bench unit. Wannamaker is a SG in a 6‚Äô1 frame. The Celtics would be wise to move on from him. 

>Ojeleye plays a different position/role so it‚Äôs not really fair to say he‚Äôs taking Romeos minutes.

This is where I question if we‚Äôre watching the same team. Ojeleye and Romeo played the exact same role this year. Defensive specialists who sat in the corner on offense. Semi isn‚Äôt capable of doing anything else so it makes sense, but in reality he shouldn‚Äôt be on the roster. Romeo is an on ball player and was misused by Stevens.   

>And the team wasn‚Äôt good enough?? That Miami series could‚Äôve went either way man and the Celtics actually outplayed them for a majority of the minutes in the first 2 games despite going down 2-0. 

Trust me, I thought we were a much better team than Miami, but that doesn‚Äôt change reality and reality says the team that made us look like children in almost every 4th quarter is about to get beat in 5. We‚Äôre not good enough right now, and a lot of that comes down to the bench not bringing enough to the table. 

>This team is relatively young but thinking too much about the future isn‚Äôt wise when they‚Äôre right on the cusp and capable of winning RIGHT NOW.

Ok? How is playing our talented young players regular season minutes going to detract from winning? You would be making sense if Romeo and Grant were bad players (they‚Äôre not) or if Kanter and Wannamaker were actually good (they‚Äôre not). 

>And I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre really going on about because Grant has literally closed multiple games at the 5 and Brad isn‚Äôt afraid to play him. He also gets more minutes than Ojelye? Also again they have different roles slightly

Except doesn‚Äôt get more minutes than Ojeleye. Grant should have been the second man off the bench all year. Instead he was tied for 9th on the team with Semi at a measly 15MPG. 


>Rob Will, similarly replaced Kanter in the rotation at some points in the playoffs. 

Yes, and my point is that he should have already been ahead of Kanter on the depth chart. Instead he played at total of **29!!!** games and was 11th on the depth chart and only got 12 minutes a game, that‚Äôs a joke. 

Williams biggest weakness is defensive IQ, something that he won‚Äôt improve on without playing through his mistakes. Had he been playing 15-20 mins during the regular season it‚Äôs likely he would have been even more prepared to step into a larger role this post season. 


>Just thrusting young guys into the lineup for the sake of development isn‚Äôt wise for a team this good, you play them as they can contribute.

They‚Äôll never be able to contribute if they don‚Äôt develop...... 

Also as we saw this postseason, both William‚Äôs were ready and had been all year to be productive players. 

>‚ÄùA bird in hand is worth two in the bush‚Äù. They shouldn‚Äôt be taking for granted how good they are and saying ‚Äúwe should develop these guys so we can win in 3-5 years‚Äù. You also rightfully pointed out, Kemba is aging and Hayward is a question mark. Brad should be coaching for the now, not development

You keep acting like playing Grant, Romeo and Rob wouldn‚Äôt help us win now, when it obviously would. None of them need 2-3 years to be good they‚Äôre already good, but they won‚Äôt get any better sitting on the bench or playing 10 mins a game. **none of our bench players outside of Smart are good enough to warrant not playing Grant/Rob/Romeo**"
12821,2020-10-08 15:57:47,j7azdi,"Jaylen supporting? It can be argued that Brown is the best player on the Celtics this season. 

Also that‚Äôs betting on development that he probably won‚Äôt get in Boston.

I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm completely against him playing for the Celtics but I‚Äôm not a fan of drafting him that early while Tyrese Maxey, Sadiq Bey, Precious, Kira Lewis, Jalen Smith, and TYRELL TERRY (big on that kid) are all available."
12822,2020-10-08 14:20:21,j7azdi,"He's not a 5 is the thing, so you don't have to worry about that. He's much more of a guard than a big. But he does have some impressive rim protection flashes thanks to his mobility, size and impressive vision, so his position is very much up in the air, and probably will be for the rest of his career.

He's certainly the most risky prospect in the draft, but we have never seen a 7 footer with as varied of a perimeter skillset as Poku has at the same age. Even KD was a really poor playmaker until he was already in his 20s. Poku is really the first of his kind, and that level of uniqueness in his skillset is what I think should really be taken into account here. Maxey is a great prospect  sure, but he's never really going to be a guy who will initiate most of your actions. And while he's certainly an excellent option and my number 2 guy there at 14, I really can't rationalize not making the talent play.

The Celtics' best player is 22, and thanks to a successful past couple of years drafting they have bought themselves a lot of time with an excellent supporting cast made up of young players. And it's not like Gordon Hayward and Kemba Walker are super old either, they're both 30, and if we've seen anything we've seen a development in players being much more long-lived than they were in the 90s or 2000s. So I think that Kemba Walker and Gordon Hayward will have 2+ years left as star level guys in Boston before they start declining.

Next year is going to be nuts, Jayson Tatum is finally coming into his own and Jaylen Brown has taken a step up. The Celtics will be just fine in the now, and if Poku becomes who I think he can become they will be even better in the future."

In the sense of traditional positions, Romeo is used as a 2/3, Semi‚Äôs a 4/3 and Grant is a 4/5. 

Offensively, you‚Äôre right that Romeo gets stuck in the corner but that‚Äôs because he‚Äôs not actually that good with the ball in his hands to warrant taking it out of any of the 5 main players‚Äô. His arch type is as an on ball player but right now he‚Äôs not particularly good at it at the NBA level. So the alternative is to have him play off ball but his lack of a 3 ball is a hindrance to the offense. This is where you‚Äôd rather have guys like Wanamaker

As far as Robert Williams goes, I sorta agree with you about his minutes over the years but we‚Äôre also not in the organization and don‚Äôt know what goes on behind the scenes. Something tells me he‚Äôs pretty frustrating to coach lol. And you can say he needs game minutes to fix some of his mistakes but who‚Äôs to say it‚Äôs not just an issue with how he approaches film, practice, etc. The game slowed down for him a bit in the bubble and Scal was actually one to point out that it seemed like something changed for him in his time off...

At the end of the day, I‚Äôm not here to change your mind man. Just giving you my take, I rather err on the side of trusting one of the best coaches in the NBA. I also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to point to these few end of rotation-level players and say he‚Äôs bad at player development when I‚Äôve seen Avery Bradley, Jae Crowder, Isaiah Thomas, Kelly Olynyk, Marcus Smart, and now Brown and Tatum  all improve under him. And a lot of it is due to how he empowers his players. At worst, the guy isn‚Äôt perfect, cut him some slack. He‚Äôs definitely in a tough spot trying to squeeze in young players on an ECF level team."
12825,2020-10-08 14:32:07,j7azdi,"Again, I see where you are coming from, and nothing you are saying is illogical. I think the disagreement stems from 2 things.

1. I don‚Äôt really buy Poku‚Äôs perimeter defense, so his fit as on non-big isn‚Äôt as appealing as it sounds on paper. Nor do I think he‚Äôs likely to put enough pressure on the rim to fully leverage his passing. He‚Äôll be extremely dangerous as a movement shooter and ball handler, but outside of transition I fail to see how he gets to an intersection of weight and athleticism that allow him to not be walled off on drives. 

2. I‚Äôm high on Jaylen Brown, but I‚Äôm not going to pretend he‚Äôs a viable #2 to Tatum, he could get there, but he needs some pretty dramatic improvements in his handle and offensive decision making. He can‚Äôt create on-ball offense right now, which is a must for your #2 to take pressure off #1. If he doesn‚Äôt get to that level then the Celtics future looks a lot less bright because as great at Tatum is, he won‚Äôt do it alone. None of our other prospects project to reach the level required to be a legit #2. I can see how one might think this sounds like I‚Äôm making a case as to why it **would** be a good idea to swing on Poku, but where I‚Äôm trying to go with this is maximizing the next 2-3 year window with Kemba and Hayward, and I believe having someone like Maxey would be a legit difference maker in that time frame, where as even if Poku hits a high outcome I don‚Äôt think the Body is ready any earlier than 2 years."
12826,2020-10-08 17:05:36,j7azdi,">You say how bad the big rotation was yet the numbers tell a completely diffrent story. 

I didn‚Äôt say our big rotation was bad, just that there‚Äôs been nobody in front of him that warrant him not having way mor PT than he‚Äôs received. Theis was great this year, he‚Äôs still not the long term solution. Williams could be. 


>Kanter was a matchup dependent big sb against bud matchups he performs. 

He‚Äôs viable against Philly, that‚Äôs pretty much it. Any other good team in the league has the guards/wings to absolutely destroy Kanter in the PnR. The guy is one of the worst defenders in the NBA, and it‚Äôs far more negative than the positives that his post scoring and rebounding bring. 



>And let me see if I get this brad gets no credit for any player development but blame for lack of player development?!?

No. He doesn‚Äôt get credit for how Tatum and Brown went into the offseason and improved from working with trainers like Drew Hanlen or TMac. 

What he does get blame for is not putting Tatum or Brown in optimal positions last year. It‚Äôs his job as coach to manage roles and dictate how the team plays. The fact that he let Rozier and Morris take so many touches away from them is bad coaching. Even this year he still underutilized Brown. 

>Timelord hasn‚Äôt played a lot in his first two years because of injuries that‚Äôs not on the coach. He wasn‚Äôt a dnp cd for the other 50 games he was hurt

He was ‚ÄúDNP coaches decision‚Äù plenty of times over the last 2 year. Injuries have played a big part, but that‚Äôs no excuse for the times he‚Äôs been healthy and sat."

Except Semi isn‚Äôt actually a good defender. He‚Äôs above average on ball vs certain archetypes, but Grant is better suited to guarding that archetype, while also being able providing weak side rim protection, and being significantly better on offense. Romeo is also a better defender while simultaneously being superior on offense. 

Semi is a bad NBA player and really doesn‚Äôt have any excuse taking up a roster spot at this point. He‚Äôs good for 6 fouls a game, that‚Äôs it. 

>Offensively, you‚Äôre right that Romeo gets stuck in the corner but that‚Äôs because he‚Äôs not actually that good with the ball in his hands

Says who? Certainly not Danny Ainge, certainly not every single scout whose ever scouted him, certainly not the statistics that show he was the best PnR scorer in college basketball and one of the best finishers in all of college basketball. 
 
>to warrant taking it out of any of the 5 main players‚Äô. 

He wouldn‚Äôt be taking it out of their hands, he‚Äôd be taking it out of Wannamaker‚Äôs hands. 

>His arch type is as an on ball player but right now he‚Äôs not particularly good at it at the NBA level. 

That‚Äôs just BS, how would we know that? He was never allowed to play that role. He‚Äôs been an on ball player his entire life, why would he suddenly be used as a corner specialist when his biggest weakness is shooting? Look I get that you love Brad Stevens, but he‚Äôs not perfect, and the way he handled Romeo‚Äôs role on offense was a mistake. 

>So the alternative is to have him play off ball but his lack of a 3 ball is a hindrance to the offense. 

Wouldn‚Äôt be a hindrance if you used him correctly. 

>This is where you‚Äôd rather have guys like Wanamaker

Wannamaker is a 6‚Äô1 shoot first SG. Having him in the game over your 6‚Äô6 lottery pick who can handle the bench initiator role much better is just bad coaching. 

>As far as Robert Williams goes, I sorta agree with you about his minutes over the years but we‚Äôre also not in the organization and don‚Äôt know what goes on behind the scenes.

You are just making excuses for Stevens. Rob should be further along than he is. If you wanna pretend game reps aren‚Äôt the most important developmental tool then go for it, it‚Äôs widely established that it is. 

>At the end of the day, I‚Äôm not here to change your mind man. Just giving you my take, I rather err on the side of trusting one of the best coaches in the NBA. 

Brad just spent a whole series getting dicked on by Eric Spoelstra, and was out coached by Nurse the series prior. He‚Äôs a good coach but he‚Äôs faaaaar from perfect. Closer to top 10 than top 5. 

>I also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to point to these few end of rotation-level players and say he‚Äôs bad at player development when I‚Äôve seen Avery Bradley, Jae Crowder, Isaiah Thomas, Kelli Olynyk, Marcus Smart, and now Brown and Tatum  all improve under him.

He‚Äôs definitely in a tough spot trying to squeeze in young players on an ECF level team.

12829,2020-10-08 17:20:51,j7azdi,"You realize that both of those things can be, and are true, right? 

Brown isn‚Äôt a #2 right now because he performs poorly in ISO and as a PnR scorer and Passer. He makes poor decisions with the ball in his hands, that can‚Äôt be the case as a #2. You can buy Synergy and look up the stats yourself, they‚Äôre ugly. 

Brown is also underutilized as a play finisher. He‚Äôs great as a roll man, great in transition, great in spot ups, great coming off a screen and getting downhill, great posting up mismatches. Pretty much he‚Äôs elite at everything offensively **except** on ball creation. 

Brown is far to often relegated to the corners when he could be involved in actions to get him in one of those play types I mentioned, he‚Äôs a deadly weapon."

12907,2020-10-07 21:08:51,j5rqd8,"I 100% would love this. I really enjoyed the Karate Kid 2010 remake. I grew up with the original but I loved the 2010 remake maybe because I was 13 when it came out. Either way, Jaden Smith was actually good in the movie and obviously Jackie Chan is wonderful. The only reason people don't like it is because its a remake and people like hating on remakes for no reason because they love the original. 

People dislike this movie just because he does Kung Fu. So the only problem they name when they say they don't like it is literally just the title..."
12908,2020-10-05 20:57:46,j5rqd8,"Jesus god no

To answer your edit - many reasons, a few being that the Jackie Chan remake has nothing to do with KK 1,2,3 or Next at all and isn‚Äôt even in the same universe, has zero mention of Cobra Kai at all, has no karate at all but instead kung fu, and that no talent kid is hyper irritating and can‚Äôt act."
12909,2020-10-05 22:01:55,j5rqd8,Wax off with this idea.
12910,2020-10-06 01:43:13,j5rqd8,"I thought karate kid (2010) was OK, but like other people said it's just unrelated to the cobra Kai/og karate kid universe. I'd personally not put him or any of the 2010 characters there, at least not with a prominent part unless there was a good reason for it. Which tbh I don't see how, so no. Maybe as an easter egg, sure, why not. But nothing more."
12911,2020-10-06 04:11:31,j5rqd8,"Crossover between the characters Dre Parker and Mr. Han are possible. I mean, whoever thought Batman and Teenage Mutant Turtles would be a thing. Street Fighter x Power Rangers. My point is, if the writers could they could write Dre in just because. Dre doesnt have to be a major role or be apart of a whole season, he could just be a nod to the fans of the remake."
12912,2020-10-14 06:29:53,j5rqd8,"I would also like this. It was a good movie.

Even though people argue that it didn't live up to the original I would argue that this tends to be based off of a continuing trend within every movie remake.

Dre Parker would be in his early 20s by now, so it would be interesting to see how he has developed and meet Daniel."
12913,2020-11-05 03:45:13,j5rqd8,It would be interesting if the reboot were canon to the original. I would love seeing Dre just chat with Daniel in China.
12914,2020-10-05 20:57:58,j5rqd8,No.  There is no way I want the Kung Fu kid introduced to the series
12915,2020-10-05 21:45:27,j5rqd8,Who are these people that want to see him? SHOW ME!
12916,2020-10-06 00:53:56,j5rqd8,"Please no, nothing against the character but Jaden smith is a horrible actor.

Absolutely horrid. Terrible."
12917,2020-12-16 16:27:12,j5rqd8,It would be dope if Jaden Smith joins team miyougi do alongside the girl from the 4th karate kid
12918,2021-01-04 07:05:28,j5rqd8,well jaden's dad is one of the executive producers but if they make the 2010 canon put cheng not dre tho
12919,2020-10-05 22:23:42,j5rqd8,"Dre Parker does not exist in this universe, does it?

No, Sensei!

I don't dislike the character. I've never had the urge to watch the remake. I've listened to some reviews that praise it, but it just hasn't happened for me apart from the times it was on when I'm flicking through the channels.  Might have caught the odd scene."
12920,2020-10-06 00:30:51,j5rqd8,"No, he doesn‚Äôt fit in with the story."
12921,2020-10-08 00:09:18,j5rqd8,"I agree with you all the way! 

People like to jump on the bandwagon on disliking 2010 KK. Also, it is not impossible to have Dre Parker participate in a later tournament. Kung Fu, Karate, Jujitsu, Capoeira, Hapkido, etc World Tournament event. Also, we get to see where he is now. Maybe moved back to Detroit after living in Hong Kong for several years."
12922,2020-10-05 22:06:53,j5rqd8,"Valid reasons that there is no connections to the KK series but I didn't think Jaden's acting was bad at all. I know others that are in favor in his movie and adore Dre Parker like myself and then others that disagree and just flat out hates the movie. Nonetheless, I love both original KK, Remake and Cobra Kai. Maybe it's just a wish and hopeless thought but his story is essentially the same but somewhat refreshed. I would like to think there are more people out there who loved the movie too."
12923,2020-10-14 18:36:58,j5rqd8,"Seems people are stuck with not wanting this to happen because it had a bad reputation with the word ""remake"" and don't want anything to do with it. It doesn't help that people dislike Jaden too. It's not fair to this movie to be honest. But I am glad to know there are a few of of us that want this to happen. :)"
12924,2020-10-05 22:15:33,j5rqd8,I definitely am :)
12925,2020-10-06 03:40:13,j5rqd8,"Wrong. Absolutely wrong. The Karate Kid remake that he starred in was terrible, but Jaden Smith can act pretty well. He holds some pretty solid chemistry when he‚Äôs on screen with most of his co-stars."
12926,2021-02-15 18:01:25,j5rqd8,"you sayin' ""jaden's dad' as if he aint will the mothafuckin' smith"
12927,2020-11-05 03:47:10,j5rqd8,Or you could get your own opinion and just watch it before disagreeing or answering someone's question.
12928,2020-10-06 00:11:30,j5rqd8,"I understand. Some people vibed it and some people didn't. I also wanted to hear people's opinion on it. For me, it will always be a movie I can watch or leave playing in the background. I dunno maybe give it a watch."
12929,2020-10-08 06:06:12,j5rqd8,Yes that would be awesome! I'd be happy with just a cameo tho. Anyway the writers can incorporate him and make it work is fine with me.
12930,2020-10-05 22:33:12,j5rqd8,"I‚Äôm not trying to shit on what you like, seriously. Just because I think that kid is a no talent hack doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm right. And I actually like Jackie Chan. What I‚Äôm saying is that it‚Äôs not at all related to this series, so it doesn‚Äôt warrant any mention or reference."
12931,2020-10-15 09:04:14,j5rqd8,"Unless they respectfully didn't like the movie and truly believe that the characters don't belong in *Cobra Kai* I understand, otherwise I detest narrow minded people."
12932,2020-10-05 22:57:37,j5rqd8,"Me too. I thought the film was fine, not as iconic as the original, but decent for what it was. I know they've said that it officially ""doesn't count"" as it's not in the same continuity, but that's the thing, it's not like it retconned the original film or trilogy, Jaden wasn't playing Daniel and Jackie wasn't playing Mr. Miyagi, so it could still co-exist.

I'd just like a small cameo, like having Jaden show up as one of the referees next time they show a karate tournament. His character doesn't even have to be named, or have any significant lines beyond calling the match. We can all just imagine that's Dre Parker, who's continued his career in martial arts in the years since his film. I think something like that would be a cool little easter egg. We know Will Smith's production company is involved in the series, so something like that should be a possibility."
12933,2020-10-06 04:16:31,j5rqd8,He had great chemistry with Jackie Chan. The scene with Mr. Han drinking and being drunk because he was upset about the death of his Wife and Child. Then Dre comforting him and continuing training to push through.
12934,2020-10-06 10:44:15,j5rqd8,"It‚Äôs a matter of opinion. So I can‚Äôt be wrong.

In my opinion he sucks and should be in the negatives for his movies"
12935,2020-10-10 04:36:22,j5rqd8,"Same, if they can show what Dre Parker has been up to it would be great. Maybe he went to college after Mr. Han and Dre went separate ways. Or maybe his mom and Mr. Han are together now and have a kid that is old enough to be in the same age group as the kids in Cobra Kai and Dre is currently teaching him."
12936,2020-10-06 04:24:02,j5rqd8,"I understand you're not disrespecting what I like. Thank you for that. We all enjoy what we enjoy. However there are still open possibilities to mentioning his character if the writers wanted to. I just think the kid got a bad rep. Look, he was awful in that Earth movie but I adored this kid in Pursuit of Happiness and Karate Kid 2010. For Jackie Chan, his character complimented Jaden's character. No matter what, I love that movie. So I'd be extra hyped if it happens. If not, I won't be upset. It wasn't meant to be."
12937,2020-10-06 03:12:19,j5rqd8,What if they make a new version of the character but with the same actor just to please the fans? Like he's just some dude in high school or a very minor character
12938,2020-10-06 00:05:50,j5rqd8,My thoughts exactly
12939,2021-03-20 00:26:18,j5rqd8,Horrible actor bro jaden was a good actor

12947,2020-10-05 12:34:52,j5haiq,"I went with Ty-Shon Alexander, I just feel like Sacramento needs two way players. Alexander is a really nice all around player to me"

12950,2020-10-05 14:01:06,j5haiq,I think Sacramento fans may riot if they get another non-defensive oriented big
12951,2020-10-05 15:09:22,j5haiq,No way the Kings are getting a Marvin Bagley without the double jump.
12952,2020-10-05 14:29:54,j5haiq,Why? He's an alright offensive big with major defensive issues. There's not really a place in the NBA for guys like him. You have to be truly special on offense to outweigh your defensive shortcomings in order to solidify a roster spot come playoff time. And I don't think Carey has what it takes to get there.
12953,2020-10-05 17:00:53,j5haiq,Really? I‚Äôm not tbh
12954,2020-10-05 16:07:54,j5haiq,Let the Spurs get him.
12955,2020-10-06 04:30:40,j5haiq,That would be a Sacramento move to draft him for sure.
12956,2020-10-05 15:28:00,j5haiq,He doesn't do anything really
12957,2020-10-06 04:26:51,j5haiq,Many guys getting oddly overlooked
12958,2020-10-05 18:40:18,j5haiq,Not necessarily - I think both should have and will realistically go much higher. But he's absolutely a first-round pick who'll go somewhere from 15-30. His worst-case projection is a high-level backup that can contribute immediately. I can't see a scenario where teams like Boston or Toronto pass on him when they both obviously will be looking for another lead guard this summer.
12959,2020-10-07 04:01:43,j5haiq,From Duke
12960,2020-10-05 16:36:00,j5haiq,You sure about that?
12961,2020-10-05 19:44:47,j5haiq,Lol I had a feeling I would see you on this thread. Maybe he actually will fall to our 2nd rounder.
12962,2020-10-07 04:07:52,j5haiq,"He should've left after his freshman year then. 2 years in, he's pretty much the same. Perhaps that lack of upside is what's making people hesitant. 

I personally think he's okay and would not be surprised if he likely ends up just being around the same level player as his brother. Defense for point guards is overrated. What can you do on offense, how effective are you in the pick and roll, do you know what to do when you get into the paint and are surrounded by tall ass dudes?

If he gets drafted high, it'll be because he went to Duke. He doesn't seem any more talented than the great college point guards we've seen that don't make it in the NBA the last 20 years.

And his worse case projection is that he fans out of the league because he can't shoot. He would have to be a Kris Dunn level defender to offset his shooting and Dunn is one of the best defensive point guards in the league. Honestly you can't get better than finding another Kris Dunn late in the first round so that's probably my comparison for him. Their college resumes and stats are also very similar."
12963,2020-10-05 19:47:12,j5haiq,"lol, look how little this world is. Jokes aside, I think that we can do pretty pretty well in this draft. I'm really busy lately, but I promise you I'll make another post on our sub about another route the Spurs can follow in thia draft, keep it simple ad usual. Vernon will be there for sure!"
12964,2020-10-05 19:50:33,j5haiq,Looking forward to it!
12965,2020-10-04 13:42:31,j4x1w7,"Malachi Flynn not having more support is blowing my mind. He‚Äôs the best PnR guard in the class, good shooter, great point of attack defender. Really feels like the perfect fit in Philly. I don‚Äôt see how Tillie and Tre Jones really fit, neither is going to create much offense and they really need more creation. I know the took terry at 21 in this mock but they need AT LEAST 2 more guys who can initiate offense in the half court because currently they have 0."
12966,2020-10-04 14:29:03,j4x1w7,Malachi Flynn
12967,2020-10-04 15:09:18,j4x1w7,"I really only see Killian Tillie if they trade both Tobias Harris and Al Horford, which is possible but I likely. Jahmi'us could be an option if they're looking for more scoring upside, which makes sense w Josh Richardson, Matisse Thybulle, Ben Simmons able to cover him defensively. Cassius Winston and Malachi Flynn could be options, but I really don't see them drafting another smaller guard now that they already have Tyrell Terry bc I don't see any of those 3 being able to guard outside of their position. Tbh I think Skylar Mays might be the best option bc he's capable of running the pick and roll and shooting the 3 like Flynn but has greater defensive versatility , which from my perspective seems to be valued highly by the 76ers just based on personnel already on the roster bc outside of Raul Neto everyone else as far as I can tell is at least 6'5."
12968,2020-10-04 11:45:10,j4x1w7,"This one has gotta be Merrill for me. He‚Äôs the best remaining player (IMO obviously) and is literally perfect for what the sixers need. He‚Äôs a big guard who can fit next to Simmons. He‚Äôs a tough tough shot maker with a really nice stepback and can create for himself fairly well while also running a secondary ball screen.

When Utah State actually did run actions for him to get open he was a lethal three point shooter. He‚Äôs a crafty finisher with a high release point and a great cutter.

The only real issue I see with him is he might have some trouble defensively. However philly is the perfect place to insulate him with a variety of plus defenders already there. But if this is too much of a turn off for you Hughes and Alexander both make sense here as does Jah‚Äômius Ramsey if you‚Äôre sold on him."
12969,2020-10-04 14:57:47,j4x1w7,There‚Äôs been some head scratchers for sure
12970,2020-10-04 14:06:42,j4x1w7,"Completely agree with this, *but* Killian Tillie is by far the BPA here, and playoff teams should be pouncing on hin at this point.

Also the Sixers have pick #36 and I have serious doubts that the Kings would be looking to pick Flynn up."
12971,2020-10-04 15:26:58,j4x1w7,What are the trade scenarios for Horford? That‚Äôs one big contract to off load.
12972,2020-10-04 12:58:03,j4x1w7,"Idk, I think Merril will really struggle to create shots for himself against NBA athleticism. He's an excellent shooter, and will probably end up getting a spot in the league just off of that, but I do worry ability to do much else. He doesn't have an air-tight handle exactly, and his burst leaves a lot to be desired.

If you're looking for a guard to pair with Simmons the best one available is Malachi Flynn. He's an amazing shooter and is probably the best PnR player in the draft. He may be 6'1, but he's probably as good of a defender as you can be with his size and build. Simmons is a great roll man and the only issue was the fact that every ball handler we tried to run PnRs with him sucked at it, Flynn, on the other hand, will be able to thrive next to Simmons, his pull-up game is terrific, he has a decent amount of burst to threaten the rim and he is a tremendous playmaker.

Personally I think the Sixers should go with Tillie here because of the incredible amounts of talent he has, but if you want a standout shooter who can be a secondary playmaker next to Simmons the pick is Flynn and not Merrill here. In fact, I think the fit between the Sixers and Malachi Flynn is so perfect that the Sixers will be fucking up *big time* if they miss out on a chance to draft him."
12973,2020-10-04 16:52:09,j4x1w7,The Kings should absolutely consider Flynn or any point guard outside of their lottery pick. Have you seen Cory Joseph run an offense?
12974,2020-10-04 15:42:47,j4x1w7,"Kings: Nic Batum, 36th pick
76ers: Terry Rozier, Cody Zeller, Harrison Barnes
Hornets: Tobias Harris, Al Horford, Zhaire Smith, 21st & 49th/58th pick

Kings get long term cap space which becomes valuable after a De'Aaron fox extension assuming one happens and a pick 
 76ers get out of 2 awful contracts and get back 2 vets w playoff experience (Rozier,Barnes) & back up for Embiid (Zeller)
Hornets get 2 vets to help them make a playoff push around their young core (Harris,Horford), a young project w upside (Zhaire Smith) & 2 picks to get more young pieces. Also get an established leader in Horford to mentor their young pieces. 

Idk something like that might make sense for all three sides depending on the perspective you take. Don't think the kings do that deal though, seems like they value Barnes. Hornets also might want more picks for taking on both contracts, or might just want to focus on their younger players without adding any vets on bad contracts, especially the Harris one, Horford at least addresses needs in terms of the center position and being a well respected vet who could take on a mentor/leadership role"
12975,2020-10-04 13:46:08,j4x1w7,"So as a counterpoint to Flynn, how many PnR‚Äôs do you actually think the sixers are gonna let him run? You‚Äôve got Simmons who‚Äôs ball dominant, Embiid who‚Äôs ball dominant, and Harris who needs shots. I agree that Flynn is terrific in the PnR but if he‚Äôs not gonna get many opportunities that neuters his offensive game. With Tillie, I‚Äôm frankly not sure if his body will hold up to a full NBA season. He‚Äôs Uber talented I just don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll fare well through an 82 game season.

Merrill may not be the pick here (I‚Äôm incredibly high on him but I‚Äôve been wrong before and will likely be wrong again) but I don‚Äôt see Tillie or Flynn as the picks. If you don‚Äôt like Merrill go 3&D wing."
12976,2020-10-04 14:04:36,j4x1w7,"Enough? Embiid doesn't play 48 minutes and Simmons struggles badly in the half court. It's also not like the *only* value that Flynn brings is on-ball, he's a great off-ball mover and is a much better shooter than his 3pt% suggests. We aren't running every single possession through one of Tobias/Embiid/Simmons, and considering how great Simmons is as a roller giving an amazing PnR guy like Flynn the ball and letting him go to work with Simmons will maximize *both* of their effectiveness in the half court. Flynn isn't going to be in the starting lineup right away either, so if you're worried about him not getting enough touches then it's going to be easier to put him into lineups where that won't be the case if he's coming off the bench.

And about Tillie the whole reason he dropped this far is injuries, so the criticism is completely valid and I would normally agree, but the draft is all about risk/reward and Tillie is a lottery talent. Let's just say that Tillie's injuries aren't an issue at the next level, it's unlikely but possible. If this is the case now the Sixers have an insanely talented 6'10 guy who can do *anything* ypu want him to do. If injuries were not an issue with Tillie I could see him going so high as 10th in this draft, this is the level of talent we're talking about. Getting a guy with this kind of upside at 34 is something that is absolutely worth it even if there's only about a 50% chance you even get 2 full seasons out of him. The Sixers are a team that needs players that they can give minutes to in the playoffs badly and Tillie is the only guy in this picking area who you could probably start in the playoffs right away if he's healthy. This is a high risk/incredile reward situation, and with the amount of 2nds the Sixers have there is no reason to *not* make this pick.

The Sixers don't need wings. They already have a pretty flooded depth chart there with Thybulle, Furkan, Shake and GRIII/Burks if one or both of them get re-signed. We either make the talent play here or get a guy who can legitimately run the 1 next to Simmons, but Shake Milton is *not* going to cut it, he is nowhere near the level of passer you need at that position. Malachi Flynn being as polished and amazing of a fit as he is more than solidifies his case to me. Besides, we have the 49th abs 58th pick to work with, and there is definitely going to be wings like Mason Jones/Malik Fitts/Nate Hinton/Elijah Hughes available if you're dead set on getting more of them. As far as this draft goes the Sixers are in a decent spot to get plenty of guys who could help them out."

**Non-Bigs**

* Kemba
* Jaylen
* Hayward
* Tatum
* Smart
* FA 

**Bigs**

* Theis
* Rob
* Grant (who can also snag minutes on the wing)"
13276,2020-10-02 13:54:54,j3u7ry,"I think the team will be largely the same next year, give or take Kanter wanting more money, they've got to pay Tatum and work out whether or not to pay Hayward in the 2021 offseason so it's hard to see the Celtics making a big move. I think the question is if either of the Williams's will take a leap to be a Centre they can give consistent minutes to."
13277,2020-10-02 14:32:13,j3u7ry,"My Celtics offseason blueprint:


Work out a trade with Sacramento for Bjelica using Kanter's salary and one of their late 1sts. The team desperately needs an offensive cog to use off their bench. Bjelica's 3 point shooting, high post passing, and experience playing in a limited role would be the perfect fit for this team at the 4 spot off the bench. Sacramento is in a rebuilding phase, and I think picks have more value to them than an expiring 32 year old contract. 


Chase Aron Baynes with the MLE. The Celtics center rotation needs defensive size, and stretch shooting. Provided Phoenix doesn't re-up him hopefully Baynes would prefer to play in a place like Boston where he is familiar with the org and the system, play on a competitive team, and get plenty of rest days. 


Draft Tyrell Terry at 14. Longer term the Celtics are going to need to find someone who can replace Kemba's shooting out of the pick and roll and off screens. Right now there is nobody else on the roster who can do that. Terry probably needs some developmental runway, but he's a higher upside prospect and again does something to help bolster the shooting off our bench."
13278,2020-10-02 15:09:26,j3u7ry,"They got to stop relying on their sophomores and 4 incoming rookies to fill the bench roles. Their core 6 is prime for a Finals run, surround them with veteran 3&D wings and combo guards."
13279,2020-10-02 13:28:04,j3u7ry,Their chances of competing for a title comes down to health and the growth in their consistency to close out games against elite teams who‚Äôve made adjustments against them
13280,2020-10-02 14:10:03,j3u7ry,"Free agency is tough.  You can wring your hands over Kemba's defensive shortcomings and missed shots and talk about spreading that money across multiple players but look at players currently under contract who signed into cap space for between 15 and 17 million, half what Kemba earned:

Rubio, Biyombo, James Johnson Fournier, Bojan, Mahimni, Portis, Marcus Morris.

Would you trade Kemba for Fournier and Bojan?  This is even charitable for this exercise as the Celtics didn't have space:  Kemba was part of a sign and trade for Terry Rozier. Swapping Kemba for the best of these players, even extricating yourself from the salary crunch and with the benefit of hindsight, is still a tough call."
13281,2020-10-02 14:48:38,j3u7ry,"There won't be any major moves, Tatum and Brown are 22 and 23 and haven't quite learned how to close teams out yet. The starting lineup was healthy for like 5 games together in a shortened year. 

If they can trade those picks and some prospects for Myles Turner I would be more than happy. He's not perfect but he might be all they need at the 5 along with another year of growth"
13282,2020-10-02 15:04:08,j3u7ry,"I know nothing about RJ Hampton, but I don‚Äôt really want the Celtics to spend another draft pick on a guy named RJ whose last name begins with H"

13284,2020-10-02 17:17:59,j3u7ry,I think they are title contenders without much improvement needed. assuming they are healthy
13285,2020-10-02 14:24:19,j3u7ry,"I don‚Äôt wanna beat a dead horse or make any excuses but the Celtics were a really young team. If you look at the best two players on the 8 best teams they‚Äôre the youngest. Lebron/AD, Kawhi/PG, Harden/Westbrook, Lowry/Siakam, Giannis/Middleton all have a few more years on them. The close ones being the heat and nuggets. The heat might tho have jimmy butler leadership and the iggy experience whereas that celtics don‚Äôt have guys like that. The Celtic ‚Äúvets‚Äù have less experience than Smart, Brown, and Tatum and it shows in how even when healthy they can‚Äôt make those 3 better. The nuggets are real close but Jamal Murray and Jokic have about a years worth of growth more than Tatum and Brown respectively. This leads me to the conclusion that no draft pick or young promising role player will take them over the hump. They either need to bring someone in who knows the grind of playoffs and can hold the young guys accountable or hope that one of Tatum or Brown can develop into that player because they‚Äôre already talented enough to be it"
13286,2020-10-02 17:34:31,j3u7ry,"Thank you for the effort, great read and really appreciate the insights!"
13287,2020-10-02 17:54:11,j3u7ry,If they sign Christian Wood they‚Äôre going to be a problem
13288,2020-10-02 14:43:37,j3u7ry,"The Celtics aren't going to do anything that jeopardizes their future.  Right now it's all about being as good as possible within the framework of ensuring the table is set to consistently contend in 3 years when Tatum and Jaylen are reaching their peaks.  Everything right now is kind of gravy beyond that.

So, within that framework, there's not much they can or will do.  The only two ""big moves"" they could possibly make are trading Kemba or Hayward.  But, Hayward's trade value is extremely limited between his max salary and being a free agent in a year.  And while Kemba is more easily tradable, that doesn't make much sense because they need a guy like Kemba and aren't very likely to improve by trading him.

So really, it comes down to the fringes.  I think they try to add a vet exception and go for somebody pretty good on the premise of ""we were one piece of depth away from coming out of the East last year, you can be it"".  Otherwise, you're looking at more or less the same team next year.

Grant Williams is indeed a rotation player.  He's not a 25% 3-point shooter, he just had a comically rough patch to start the season and it was small volume.  In the playoffs he actually shot 59% from deep (10 of 17).  We will see where he goes - he's not Steph Curry, but he shot 82% from the FT line is last year of college on high volume, so that projects he should be at least a 35% guy in this league if he develops his shot.

I think Romeo proves much more useful next year as well.  Injuries destroyed this year - but he already does two very useful things that will give him heavier minutes next year - perimeter defense and slashing to the hoop.

Last key guy is Robert Williams.  Another guy who has been derailed by injuries, he showed what he's capable of in spot duty in the postseason, and he's getting better.  Another offseason puts him in line for a potential 3rd year leap into a guy they can count on for 20 minutes a night."
13289,2020-10-02 22:01:13,j3u7ry,"the problem for boston is they have no good center  


i mean it's fine for some teams but if teams like denver, or a healty porzingis mavs, or heaven forbid LA come knocking then they're going to find their roster as is isn't going to be a contender  


a healthy philly, maybe the bucks if giannis stops being a derp in the playoffs won't be very fun with no center  


boston isn't alone tho the lakers looking as good as they are is a problem because none of the contenders really have the pieces needed to stop an AD+lebron combo, either missing a center or missing someone for lebron  


i think really only the clippers as much as people memed on them losing are the like ONE team that you could say on paper might be favoured mostly because they could bother lebron pretty well and potentially keep the ball out of his hands, the key as all this season was ""can AD be AD"", and he.. wasn't really for most of the games against the clippers but maybe next year will be different with all this experience

And next season he‚Äôs actually on a non guaranteed deal, not a team option. The semantics are important here because if they were to get him off that contract to sign to the MLE he‚Äôd be exposed to waivers first, whereas with a team option he would not."

Rob Williams plays like a traditional big, but he's 6'8 and that is noticeable on the boards. This way we can get shooting from the bench, like we could with Kanter, but we can play a traditional big that can defend the post against certain match-ups which Kanter was very limited, as we saw in the Play-Offs with his very limited minutes."

The Celtics will get to move up in the draft due to the trade.  That's actually the reason why Aron Baynes was traded to Phoenix.  It was to clear cap space for Kemba and they could only swap Kemba and Rozier because the Celtics had cap space.  Their salaries don't match and if both teams were over, the trade would be illegal."

>The Celtics will get to move up in the draft due to the trade. That's actually the reason why Aron Baynes was traded to Phoenix.

Yes and no.

We can use that improved 2nd to move up, but we've also already moved down in trading Baynes. 

In the Phoenix trade, we gave Baynes + #24 and got this year's Milwaukee pick back in return. 

In the Charlotte trade, we did a pick swap for 2nds.


* We had: #24 + #56

* We now have: #30 + #47

I don't think we can even move back to where we were, let alone up from where we were.


>Their salaries don't match and if both teams were over, the trade would be illegal.

If we had space for 90% of Kemba's contract we'd only need to salary match the final 10%. We still could have done the Kemba-Rozier swap without dumping Baynes. 

Dumping Baynes gave us the leverage to sign Kemba outright and also some flexibility in terms of how we handled potential sign-and-trade magic that would have let us keep Horford."

So the post title with ""Big Hero 6"" talking about Boston needing to add another piece is actually pretty painful.

Tyler Herro would have been the perfect addition to this team. He's exactly what we needed off our bench this year and a big 3 of Tatum/Brown/Herro long term would have been devastating."

Sometimes there are growing pains but he‚Äôs been on a definitive upward trajectory. He came into the NBA extending his range. Then it was getting to the rim and free throw line. This season he came in with a leap on defense, going from good to elite at that end of the floor. It was clear in the bubble that he spent the break working on his passing.

You can't compare Edwards to Trae Young. Seldom any young PG has the ""offensive firepower"" of Young. He's an All-Star. Edwards can be a good offensive player for use because he pushes the ball fast, works on PnR and isn't afraid to shoot first. Of course time will tell if he's an option or not, but being a 6th man with 20 min off the bench would be amazing. We are not expecting him to be a starter player. Kemba isn't going nowhere, dumping his salary to a rebuilding team wouldn't get us a player to compete now. That's the reality."

Even if he turns it over once or twice in the fourth, his scoring efficiency compared to the others shouldn't have been ignored like they were.  That's on the players and Stevens."

Turner is barely better than Theis in that regard and arguably isn‚Äôt even a better rebounder despite being 3-4 inches taller. He‚Äôs just not worth it. I‚Äôd rather get Baynes for the MLE.

The Celtics have done right by him, and he's now gotten paid 3 years of max contract for minimal return.  Boston is a good situation for him, and between his relationship with Stevens and feeling like he hasn't delivered for the franchise - it's very possible Hayward extends with some kind of discount 4/60 instead of trying for another max on the open market (which he may not be able to even get unless he looks great and healthy next year).

Meanwhile, Oladipo will 100% be looking for a max deal."
13399,2020-10-02 14:26:44,j3u7ry,"I meant Hayward has more reasons to stay with the Celtics than Oladipo. If we trade Hayward for Oladipo, it will be a lateral move at best and we can't keep him anyway. And even if Oladipo's contract is cheaper, we're still above the cap."

Too much Horford potential. Those decisions get gms fired. The teams that could actually use Gordon are not going to have the money outside of Miami and I think they‚Äôre gonna keep their powder dry for Giannis.

13410,2020-10-02 15:40:48,j3u7ry,Raptors are the gods of drafting outside the lottery
13411,2020-10-03 13:38:15,j3u7ry,"The problem for the Celtics is roster spots. We're running out of them... we can offer fifteen full contracts and two 2-ways. These nine guys are all guaranteed a spot: 

Tatum, Brown, Smart, Hayward, Kemba, Theis, Grant, Rob, Romeo

Kanter will opt in. That's 10 taken. One of the two-ways can go to Tacko again. That means you have six spots (five roster and a two-way) to go around for: 

Ojeleye, Wanamaker, Carsen, Tremont, Javonte

and

3 first round, 1 second round pick

and

people want to clear a spot for the MLE. 

So that's ten potential players for six remaining spots. Obviously we want to consolidate picks via trading up but if deals aren't on offer or are bad value... we can stash at least one draft pick. We can let Javonte walk. Then... what do we do? Edwards is an undersized bench scorer drafted in the second round who didn't shoot well for the entire year and couldn't hang on defense. You giving him a roster spot over either Semi or Wanamaker, or Tremont? Or are you selling one of the picks or stashing like 3 guys? 

That's why saying goodbye to Edwards probably makes sense"
13412,2020-10-02 18:48:10,j3u7ry,Kemba especially would work best late in the shot clock as a bailout finisher or catch and shoot guy. Instead of being forced to be the primary initiator when he can get trapped and can't see over the floor.

>Room Scenario ‚Äî 

>Rule ‚Äî If a team‚Äôs team salary is below the salary cap, then a traded player may be replaced in the same transaction by one or more players whose salaries together do not exceed the team‚Äôs room plus $100,000.  There are two important points for this rule.  First, it means that the complicated salary matching formulas described below do not apply to a team receiving a player into cap space.  Second, the CBA allows teams that are below the cap to use the rules for teams over the cap (which they‚Äôd do if it works to their advantage). 

>Example ‚Äî Assume (i) salary cap = $99.093 million, (ii) team salary = $90 million, and (iii) tax level = $119.266 million.  A team seeks to trade a $10 million player.  That team could replace that player in a simultaneous trade with one or more players making $19.193 million.  ($99.093 million minus $90 million, plus $10 million, plus $100,000.)   

>https://cbabreakdown.com/salary-cap-exceptions#:~:text=Rule%20%E2%80%94%20If%20a%20team's%20team,important%20points%20for%20this%20rule.

In the example given, a team is able to take on 19m in salaries despite only having 9m in space beforehand. This is because they're also trading 10m away so they don't ever go over the cap.

Likewise, if Boston has 30m in cap space and wants to take on a 34m contract, they only have to worry about trading off the final 4m. They don't have to dip 64m below cap just to take on that 34m contract."
13415,2020-10-03 11:42:37,j3u7ry,"That‚Äôs because he‚Äôs essentially playing PF next to Sabonis this season. The year before he lead the league in blocked shots, plus he can space the floor. 

I agree that Turner in a vacuum doesn‚Äôt move the needle. Yes, Turner does have some warts in his game, namely being ineffective on the short roll and having no post game (offense or defense), but he could open up the floor for our wings and allow them to take more chances on the perimeter that translates to getting out on the break. 

Given that he‚Äôs signed for 3 more seasons and is several years younger than Theis, I like the fit long term. We can cover for him with a guy like Kanter when we need elite rebounding and post defense. I‚Äôm sure Turner would improve too, especially in Brad‚Äôs system that emphasizes spacing. The Pacers are literally a cluster right now, their rotation makes no sense."
13416,2020-10-02 17:51:42,j3u7ry,"Amen. After all, one of the reasons Gordo signed with the team is due to unfinished business with Brad"
13417,2020-10-02 18:06:32,j3u7ry,"4/60 seems unrealistic, even to a homer like me.  I think he'll see 4/100 or 4/110 as a discount.  I'm fairly confident if he has another decent year like this year, someone will give him a 4/120 or max.  Lots of teams will have plenty of cap space in 2021, and not everyone is going to land Giannis or Kawhi.  When they strike out on them, a team will offer a second tier star like Hayward good money, surely it'll blow 4/60 out of the water.  That's like Marcus Morris/Julius Randle money.  Hayward is tons better than people in that tier."
13418,2020-10-02 14:28:16,j3u7ry,"i mean, we *could* keep dipo. we'd inherit his bird rights in a trade. the concern would be the future tax implications.

but yea, i hear you...i'd be more confident in hayward re-signing than dipo re-signing."
13419,2020-10-02 16:26:42,j3u7ry,The biggest difference for me is that Langford is already a good NBA level defender. Young was never that. Langford can get minutes on his defense alone if his coach is Brad Stevens
13420,2020-10-02 15:29:49,j3u7ry,"he also had a track record of wing prospects who did pan out though: tatum and brown

i mean hunter and brooks werent high picks they were never expected to pan out

actually even james young was outside the lottery"
13421,2020-10-02 19:11:12,j3u7ry,"Counterpoint: Ainge also has young wing prospects in Terry Rozier, Avery Bradley, Tony Allen, and Delonte West who did pan out."
13422,2020-10-02 19:45:08,j3u7ry,Danny has free burritos for life at Chipotle. Not sure if that extends to tacos but they can probably fit a clause into Tatum‚Äôs extension.
13423,2020-10-02 16:49:11,j3u7ry,"The Nets trade was in 2013. While there have been a large volume of picks outside the lottery, a lot of them have been 2nd rounders. 

Celtics have had 11 first round picks and turned those into 

Hits- Marcus Smart 5, Terry Rozier 16, Jaylen Brown 3, Jayson Tatum 3 

Too early to say - Grant Williams 22, Romeo Langford 14, Robert Williams 27

Misses - James Young 17, Yabusele 16, Ante Zizic 23, RJ Hunter 28

So while the record since the Nets draft outside the lottery hasn‚Äôt been stellar, thats the beauty of acquiring so many picks. You get to take a lot of swings of the bat.

And the fact that he nailed all 3 of the picks with Smart, Jaylen, and Tatum shouldn‚Äôt be overlooked. Both the Suns and Sixers had more high picks in a short span of years, and picked with lesser success. And the Rozier pick was used as an asset in a sign and trade to acquire Kemba."
13424,2020-10-02 18:00:24,j3u7ry,Warriors got a few decent guys too
13425,2020-10-02 19:09:08,j3u7ry,"Shoot as many what?  He shot 56/50/71 on 17 FGA and 5.5 3P FGA a game.  It wasn't that he didn't shoot that series, it was that he didn't get opportunities in late game/clutch time.

&#x200B;

Part of the reason he shot so well was because he got the guards (Robinson/Herro) on him when Miami was in zone.  He got to eat them alive while others were defended by Butler, Crowder and Bam.  That was a big mismatch for the Celtics that they never took advantage of late in the game, despite going to it early and often in the first halves."
13426,2020-10-03 17:00:29,j3u7ry,"Right, I understand the concept of operating below the cap. You are allowed to subtract your outgoing salary first and then add the incoming salary when determining whether or not it is a valid trade (plus 100k in wiggle room). 

The part I‚Äôm having trouble with are the percentages you referenced. You seemed to imply that you can 1. use your room for a portion of the incoming salary, as I described above, and then 2. you can salary match the portion of incoming salary that brings you above the cap. I can see this working, but only when 1. and 2. are separate contracts. 

Maybe I‚Äôm misunderstanding something here. I am fairly well versed in the overall CBA rules, but I‚Äôm sure there are edge cases that I haven‚Äôt grasped yet (i.e. when you made your Horford S&T post, that shit was lit dawg)."
13427,2020-10-03 19:13:01,j3u7ry,"That‚Äôs not why though. He‚Äôs always been able to block shots. He still gets bodied by big centers and can‚Äôt rebound. 

He doesn‚Äôt move the needle, so why basically go all in for a guy who doesn‚Äôt move the needle? It‚Äôs basically our last chance to make a move to build around Tatum and Brown. How does that make sense?"
13428,2020-10-02 16:34:37,j3u7ry,He has the size and tools to be Brown-lite. What was his issue with the lack of playing time? Was it just the injuries?
13429,2020-10-02 17:05:21,j3u7ry,"Say what you want about semi, but he will be an nba player for a long time, which is great value for where he was picked as well"
13430,2020-10-02 21:25:08,j3u7ry,Literally every franchise has a long list of hits and misses
13431,2020-10-03 01:42:44,j3u7ry,"Exactly and Rondo was an incredible pick. Gerald Green has had a long career, probably several others as well. Danny Ainge gets shit on for his drafting by guys like Nick Wrong who are just pure haters. Not every draft pick is going to pan out, and anybody holding a GM accountable for every pick outside of the lottery is just looking for something to nit pick. If you consistently miss over and over then sure it‚Äôs a dilemma, but Ainge has far from ‚Äúmissed‚Äù over and over."
13432,2020-10-03 15:30:00,j3u7ry,There‚Äôs this Marcus Smart guy that I hear is pretty good too
13433,2020-10-02 17:26:16,j3u7ry,"I agree. 2016 mid round picks weren‚Äôt good, but Danny also felt he had to reach on lesser talent because we didn‚Äôt have enough space on our team and he wanted to stash rookies."
13434,2020-10-02 18:42:37,j3u7ry,"If the only non lottery pick that ainge can celebrate is rozier, then I think my point stands"
13435,2020-10-02 18:03:14,j3u7ry,Seems incredibly average outside of Draymond
13436,2020-10-02 19:21:34,j3u7ry,"Jaylen was the beneficiary of whatever ball movement they had against the zone. Late in the game that movement stopped as they tried to get the ball into Tatum‚Äôs hands and they worked down the clock. 

It was excruciating to watch them play completely different than what they had success with. That being said, if Tatum makes some shots the series plays out differently 

What it comes down to is that they were outplayed on the floor. They didn‚Äôt make enough plays"
13437,2020-10-03 23:51:51,j3u7ry,"Because we wouldn‚Äôt need to go all in to nab the extra center from a small market team in a cap crunch. And again, it‚Äôs less about what he contributes individually, and more about how he opens up the flour for our stars. And oh, by the way, can protect the rim without fouling out in 20 minutes."
13438,2020-10-02 17:33:01,j3u7ry,"It was mostly injuries, which will be my biggest concern for him going forward"
13439,2020-10-02 21:19:25,j3u7ry,"Injuries, injuries, injuries. He didn‚Äôt play summer league and then got hurt when he started his g-league stint. A couple other injuries throughout the season. when his number was called in Game 3 he only last 81 seconds before he got hurt and couldn‚Äôt return. 

The other thing is depth. Boston has 4 excellent wings in Smart, Brown, Hayward, and Tatum. There were only so many minutes to go around and when those guys were injured Romeo was still out."
13440,2020-10-04 03:34:35,j3u7ry,Yeah I love Smart. But he was the 5th pick and was expected to go between 4-6. I was more talking about players taken later in the draft.
13441,2020-10-02 19:05:51,j3u7ry,"It‚Äôs a defensible comment in terms of post Nets trade for sure.

Though with 3/11 of the first round picks being rookies and a sophomore, 2 of which have had had bad injury luck. There is still a lot up in the air. So it could be anywhere from 5/11 to 7/11 that pan out in total depending on their development.

Also Ainge has a solid draft record prior to the Nets trade. And mathematically has been one of the best drafters in the league.

13442,2020-10-02 18:17:46,j3u7ry,Steph? Klay?
13443,2020-10-04 05:24:00,j3u7ry,"It is about what he contributes individually. This is probably the last big move we can make before we‚Äôre in cap hell with Tatum, Brown and Smart are our core. Turner is clearly better than Theis, but isn‚Äôt good enough to justify him being our last piece. 

He‚Äôs a much better shooter and rim protector than Theis but still gets abused by big centers and cannot rebound for his life. And btw Turner still gets in foul trouble. Besides if you‚Äôre a Celtics fan you know it‚Äôs basically a meme at this point that Theis gets the short end of the stick from the refs."
13444,2020-10-02 18:18:52,j3u7ry,They‚Äôre lottery picks. 7 and 11.
13445,2020-10-04 12:00:04,j3u7ry,"Fair enough, agree to disagree. Who would you make a big push for instead?"
13446,2020-10-02 18:23:47,j3u7ry,I thought lottery meant Top 4
13447,2020-10-02 18:24:16,j3u7ry,Top 14
13448,2020-10-02 11:41:32,j3sf4o,"Still Nnaji here. I still think he‚Äôll be able to shoot and switch at the NBA level and frankly I‚Äôm not sold on anyone in their frontcourt.

I don‚Äôt get the mannion pick. Lamelo was already chosen for the hornets and even if you‚Äôre aiming BPA there‚Äôs probably 3-4 guys you have to take as no brainer before you even start to think about mannion (not to mention fit next to graham, etc)."
13449,2020-10-02 11:05:59,j3sf4o,Who TF said nico mannion after we just drafted LaMelo.
13450,2020-10-02 13:46:44,j3sf4o,"It's gotta be Killian Tillie right worst comes to worst he's a Nemanja Bjelica type and when surrounding Lamelo the first thing I would want is shooters and Tillie is the best available with a skillset that doesn't overlap w Lamelo, Devonte' Graham, Terry Rozier( tbh if they draft Lamelo I think they trade Rozier and start Lamelo at the 2 w Graham at the 1. The whole reason Rozier wanted out of Boston was in part because he felt he could be a starter so he isnt gonna take getting benched very well). I could also see them going Robert Woodard if they wanted a 3&D type at the 3 to back up Miles Bridges bc I really don't think the Martin twins are much more than low end rotation players long term with limited potential to be much more than that"
13451,2020-10-02 12:11:20,j3sf4o,"I say u take a flyer on Vernon with Cody Zeller getting older and just being 10 and 6, biyombo up for contract, and Willy up for contract. I say you see if Vernon could be your ‚ÄúCody‚Äù or even better, I could see him being not good though"
13452,2020-10-02 12:32:05,j3sf4o,I would be a very happy bunny if Nnaji is still on the board for us.
13453,2020-10-02 11:49:50,j3sf4o,"Hughes seems like a solid pick here, also seems like the type of player our front office would like."
13454,2020-10-02 10:57:59,j3sf4o,"I missed the 31st pick... 


I thought it hasn't started yet."
13455,2020-10-02 12:32:36,j3sf4o,"Going Carey>Nnani just because I think they could use his physicality in the inside, and thus will get more use out of him sooner.  I also generally think his ceiling is higher than Nnaji, but I really like either pick.  To be honest, if Im the gm of the hornets at this point, Im drafting the better interviewer."
13456,2020-10-02 11:28:39,j3sf4o,Jordan Nwora for me tried to blend college performance with need. Think they‚Äôd want to take a swing at getting something else on the wing. Could very well go Big man though
13457,2020-10-02 20:27:42,j3sf4o,"Nick Richards is my favorite big. Just made a huge leap. Jaxson Hates athletic ability, can switch. good free throw shooter, showed foundations of a good jumper. was winning UK games this year"
13458,2020-10-02 22:06:58,j3sf4o,"Tillie/Nnaji are the only acceptable answers here. 

Without Hampton/Terry/McDaniels/Bane/Reed/Riller/Tillman on the board it makes it easy. If one/some of that group falls I‚Äôll be interested to see what we do. If not we can only make a safe pick of we‚Äôre probably fuckin up tbh"
13459,2020-10-02 16:26:18,j3sf4o,Not sure if Washington counts as front court but hes a stud
13460,2020-10-02 13:01:25,j3sf4o,Surely NBA teams can‚Äôt be this stupid in real life and let Nnaji last to 32...surely

13462,2020-10-02 11:36:45,j3sf4o,Is he not the BPA?
13463,2020-10-02 17:22:43,j3sf4o,"Worst comes to worst with Tillie he never plays an NBA minute because of injuries.

Tillie is not a guy I think rebuilding teams should take. There is no guarantee you get more than 2 seasons out of him, and I don't trust him to last until the Hornet's rebuild is over."
13464,2020-10-02 15:02:07,j3sf4o,He should‚Äôve been gone so long ago
13465,2020-10-02 20:30:07,j3sf4o,he is not the BPA
13466,2020-10-02 17:34:17,j3sf4o,"If you're a lottery team for a decade and only make the playoffs once like the Hornets I feel like they have to make a high risk, high reward pick like that bc taking high floor low ceiling backup type players aren't going to anything to help them get back to the playoffs. Like for example the Martin twins I brought up before are both 25 so they're fairly close to their peak and their peak is what, 5-7ppg on solid efficiency? It makes more sense to take Killian whose upside I feel is 13-15 ppg on good efficiency, 5rbs, and 2asts even though there is higher bust potential due to the injury risks. You don't make the playoffs without taking some level of risk, and unfortunately sometimes that risk doesn't pay off but that doesn't mean you shouldn't take it in the first place."
13467,2020-10-02 17:26:28,j3sf4o,"No he should not have lol, Hughes doesn't do anything really well. And he doesn't have big enough strengths to outweigh his massive weaknesses. 

You cannot be Hughes' level of defender and decision maker without bringing an elite level of shooting, ballhandling or athelticism and expect to be anything but a mid 2nd round pick."
13468,2020-10-03 03:06:38,j3sf4o,"This cracks me up.


Really interesting to read convo‚Äôs here.


This draft is really flattened. I can‚Äôt wait what are picks will look like, two years from now."
13469,2020-10-02 17:40:06,j3sf4o,"Tillie is a lottery type talent, but there are other high-upside players available here that aren't ""successful NBA player or never plays more than 60 games in his career"" cases like Tillie.

Zeke Nnaji for example is a guy with a pretty high ceiling as an offensive big, and he has a myriad of outcomes, so even if he doesn't hit he can still potentially be a productive bench big.

Tillie is a bad kind of a risk for a lottery team to take I think."
13470,2020-10-02 18:00:08,j3sf4o,What are these massive weaknesses you speak of?
13471,2020-10-02 18:01:20,j3sf4o,What's your opinion on how high Zeke's ceiling is? I'm not very high on him so clearly there's a difference of opinion here
13472,2020-10-02 18:16:38,j3sf4o,"Awful defender, incredibly poor decision maker, very low effort player.

Essentially everything you don't want in a player."
13473,2020-10-02 18:15:38,j3sf4o,"I'm not super high on him either, but if he hits a high end shooting outcome he can be a very dynamic offensive big in the NBA, and him being a lretty good mover and vertical athelte makes me believe he can be a solid defender too. But he's certainly a project as pf right now, because his skills are apparent, but nowhere near NBA level.

Obviously not the incredible player that Tillie is, but Tillie having 3 season ending injues in 3 consecutive seasons in college really puts me off.

I think Nnaji is a better risk for Charlotte to take."
13474,2020-10-02 18:24:49,j3sf4o,To me if you're not going Tillie then Ramsey is the next best option not Zeke bc I see Ramsey's high end as Malik Beasley-esque which would be much more impactful and even if that doesn't work he still has some wiggle room to exist as a 3 point specialist who tries on defense which even in that instance would be better than a dude who's most likely going to be a mediocre rotation big who can be easily replaced by a small ball 5 who can shoot like say idk Jamychal Green
13475,2020-10-02 18:42:27,j3sf4o,"Oh, I picked Robert Woodard. He's the best defensive prospect on the board and the last thing the Hornets need is another bad guard defender."
13476,2020-10-02 18:48:44,j3sf4o,He would've been 3rd on my big board Tillie and Ramsey I do agree they need another wing defender bc that's the most valuable archetype in the league currently
13477,2020-10-03 03:27:48,j3sf4o,"I keep checking for comments on Woodard. I still find him to be worthy of a first round pick. And still expect him to go in the first round, in the actual draft.


I'm not going to throw BPA argument, this late in the draft. I think there's at least 5 comparable players, that can be said as BPA at this pick.


My reason for picking Woodard is value. Defense, versatility and age(younger compared to the available wings). Also has an upside to be a spot up shooter. 



If he can develop a reliable corner three. At 6'7 with 7'1 wingspan, you can get a PJ Tucker type of player."
13478,2020-10-03 03:50:37,j3sf4o,"Easy with the PJ Tucker comp. Woodard isn't a genius and he's not nearly as strong. PJ Tucker's skillset is way more uncommon than people think. I would almost say that Woodard is more along the lines of a Jermai Grant in the terms of being a 3/4 who brings rim protection and a limited, but present, offensive game.

He's got some mental things to iron out, which is what makes me a little hesitant, but overall he has good instincts and really good athelticism, so he can most likely be a good defender in the NBA.

I also think he's better on the ball (offensively) than he hets credit for. He's got a much higher ceiling than people realize, and while he's not a player who'll ever be a dynamic offensive guy, realistically speaking, I think if he continues to develop his handle and hits a high end outcome both there and as a shooter he can be able to consistently attack closeouts in the NBA while still being a high-impact defender. 

I think he's a guy whose value increases in the playoffs due to his versatility granted he improves on the flashes he showed on offense and defense."
13479,2020-10-03 04:53:26,j3sf4o,"Yeah more of a wing. But Tucker was utilized as a wing defender with the Suns, when he was a bit younger. Though I agree that Tucker's IQ is amazing.

My comparison was more about measurement and role(when Tucker was younger). I don't think he will get near Tucker's impact."

13491,2020-10-01 15:56:25,j39d70,I see what you‚Äôre saying but I‚Äôm not sure how relevant it is to the request.
13492,2020-10-01 17:25:37,j39d70,"I haven't read the rules, is relevancy a requirement?"
13493,2020-10-01 17:45:51,j39d70,"Not against the rules. You‚Äôre free to say what you want. I just feel like if you‚Äôre going to take the time to reply to a request, it should at least be relevant."

13498,2020-10-01 19:56:12,j39d70,That's more than a feeling.
13499,2020-10-01 11:36:27,j36b84,"I think the second round has the potential to be even more fun because wilder swings can be taken. I took Nnaji here. Not only do I think he‚Äôs the best remaining player available but I also think he fits terrifically next to luka and Kristaps long term (or as a smaller ball 5 when KP sits).

I‚Äôm confident he‚Äôs gonna shoot the ball and be able to switch which could help the defense. I don‚Äôt believe there‚Äôs a 3 and D wing left on the board that would be ready to go right away and help that frankly atrocious defense (and they‚Äôll likely get buried on the depth chart). Plus with Powell recovering from an Achilles injury it‚Äôs hard to know what you‚Äôre gonna get from him. Nnaji seems like the pick here"
13500,2020-10-01 19:29:28,j36b84,"I‚Äôve been voting Paul Reed since like pick 22, I will admit I did vote Riller to the Knicks"
13501,2020-10-01 13:54:14,j36b84,I‚Äôm gonna keep voting Paul Reed until he‚Äôs selectedüò§
13502,2020-10-01 11:34:10,j36b84,"I chose Killian Tillie because he's by far the best player available right now, but I think if Dallas doesn't think he'll ever play in the NBA then the pick should be Tre Jones.

Jones is the most solid decision maker I've seen in a while. He rarely ever makes a bad decision in a game, but he also doesn't make any risky ones, and I think that's a good thing to have next to a mega-creator lile Luka. Plus Tre Jones has the ability to be a positive defender in the NBA despite his height, similar to his brother.

Dallas needs guys who can bolster Luka's impact on offense without needing the ball, and Tre does that. Dallas also needs guys who can have an impact on the defensive end, and I think that Tre Jones is one of the few guys who can have a high level of impact defensively at a below average height for a guard. And a non-zero amount of that has to do with the fact that the same is true about his brother, so he's definitely got the genes to do so, which is a big part of why many good guard defenders in college are bad in the NBA.

I know that Dallas has Brunson, and a lot of people like him as a long term guard to pair with Luka, but I think Tre Jones is a better option, and at 31 I think it's worth taking someone you're almost certain will just pan out to be a fine player in the NBA.

I could see a similar case to be made for Malachi Flynn because of all of this, but I think Tre Jones is a slightly better fit next to Luka."
13503,2020-10-01 11:48:07,j36b84,Hughes or Ramsey imo
13504,2020-10-01 14:56:21,j36b84,"I voted Ramsey, but I see compelling arguments for Jones and Reed. I don't know much of what, exactly, Dallas' big challenge is on Defense. Ramsey (IMO) won't make it worse, and I'm not sure I see how any single player makes it better without an overhaul of the team's approach.

He seems the guy left most able to score points, which has value when Doncic isn't on the court, and maybe even with him."
13505,2020-10-01 17:29:17,j36b84,Woodard
13506,2020-10-01 14:13:29,j36b84,"Elijah Hughes. Keep getting wings, and Hughes can do pretty much everything on offense"
13507,2020-10-02 09:19:20,j36b84,"I went Ramsay.

Seems like a good combo of upside and instant contribution while not overlapping with the two stars."
13508,2020-10-01 11:42:34,j36b84,I don‚Äôt think Toppin lasts till 10
13509,2020-10-01 13:51:43,j36b84,"I would like Nanji at 31, but the thing is it might be a little bit redundant especially saying that Dwight, KP, and Maxi are all guys who play the best imo at the 5.

I like that Paul Reed is leading right now, he‚Äôs a player that would improve our defense by a lot. If his offensive game is worked on and made at least acceptable by the shooting coaches that I do trust, then that would open up a lot more not only for his game but for the team also.

I just like his energy and versatility that he would bring coming off the bench. Just give him a good 18-22 MPG and I‚Äôm sure that would make lots of high level, energy plays on defense that could change the momentum of a lot of our games.

One more thing is which I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôre going to keep with this tradition, but we rarely do pick Freshman players in the draft. We have only taken 1 Freshman in the NBA Draft since 2000 and that was DSJ in 2017. So I don‚Äôt know how much I would take into that, but it is something that we don‚Äôt do that often."
13510,2020-10-01 15:34:41,j36b84,I finally voted with you üòÇ
13511,2020-10-01 16:29:07,j36b84,"Yeah man, i feel like this would be a great opportunity for the mavs to pick a guy that's first round talent imo"
13512,2020-10-02 03:15:27,j36b84,"We don't need another midget guard. Just find a project athletic big to have ready to play by 2021 if we need to move Powell or KP is hurt.

Also Tre is not as talented as Brunson is on offense. The games Luka did not play and Brunson played heavy minutes he was averaging 14ppg 9apg."
13513,2020-10-02 09:20:14,j36b84,"Remember they took Lewis Jr at 18.

Drafting 2 PGs seems like overkill."
13514,2020-10-02 03:27:14,j36b84,"Yes, but you don't need an on-ball guy. You just need someone who can consisntely be a complimentary peice to Luka, and Tre Jones is that guy."
13515,2020-10-02 09:22:58,j36b84,"Carlisle would appreciate it I think.

Also, I'm suprised Lewis made it to them. I still think Jones is one of the best bets at this spot in the draft. I don't really see a path for him to be a bad player, and at 31 it's hard to do better than that I think."
13516,2020-10-02 03:48:30,j36b84,"Then we find someone who can catch and shoot or defend the paint. I'm tired of seeing Carlisle pull out his triple midget guard lineup. It's good for offense but terrible for defense. I don't care how smart he is on defense when his fellow perimeter teammates are gonna be as short as he is.

We have Brunson locked up for another 2 years. If we want to add another small guard, we can resign Trey Burke who is the complete opposite of Tre but is the type of small guard I'd rather have."

13542,2020-09-30 13:07:42,j2kcez,"I definitely wouldn't mind the Vassell and Riller draft at all as a Knicks fan.

But I'd definitely would want Tyrese Maxey at 8 purely off his upside. Shot creating guards are the second most valuable types of players in the NBA next up playmaking wings. With that I'd also take Tyler Bey at 27"
13543,2020-09-30 14:16:21,j2kcez,"Boston Came into this with a really good chance to walk away a better team, and absolutely did not do that. 

Poku is good, and a nice value at 14, but not for the Celtics. Brad Stevens will not give Poku the playing time he will need to develop, and the Celtic will get minimal value out of his first contract while they try and contend during the last years of Hayward and Kemba‚Äôs effectiveness.

Bolmaro is in the same boat as Poku, Even if we ignore the fact that he wants to stay in Europe another year, he also really needs to develop a shot, but won‚Äôt get a chance to see the court on the Celtics, 

Finally, Tyler Bey is a good prospect, and one that almost every team can find a role for immediately, but of course, the Celtics are one of the only teams that don‚Äôt need more wing depth. 

All 3 of the selections are good players, yet at the time of every pick there was at least 1 better option still on the board."

13545,2020-09-30 12:28:47,j2kcez,"Some fun discussion based on this mock...

ROY: Lamelo Ball (think he would get the most minutes on Charlotte as opposed to anyone else)

Steal of the draft: Hard to pick one but my answer goes to Okongwu, a surefire top prospect in this draft at #9

Biggest reach: Pokuveski, I don‚Äôt like him in the first round, especially not to the Celtics

Best fit: Deni with the Bulls

Worst fit (aside from Pokusevski mentioned above): Josh Green to the Nets stands out, I think they could have gone for a guy who is less of a project and could make a bigger impact sooner. Maybe Im just low on Green."

13565,2020-09-30 17:30:18,j2kcez,"Why? They're weak at the 5. Wisemen has huge potential, especially on the defensive end. While his jump shot is a work in progress, it has potential and at the very least he'll be a rim runner. Wisemen feels like the safest pick. His most likely floor is a defensive big who can finish lobs and run the floor. He has a crazy high ceiling too."

13575,2020-09-30 12:28:15,j2kcez,"I think the biggest struggle with predictIng a Cs draft this year is that the odds of us keeping all three picks at their current slots is pretty low.

I'd be pretty happy with getting Bolmaro if we do keep multiple picks, though. 

I'm really looking forward to this draft because there's about 899 different ways it can go for us that I won't be mad at."
13576,2020-10-01 03:12:53,j2kcez,"Toppin just feels like the type of player that people who know of the Suns, but don't follow the Suns, would want the Suns to pick.

Suns are in a similar spot to the Cs where there are a tonne of different options at 10 that should serve them well."

13578,2020-09-30 17:43:57,j2kcez,"A 3 Centers rotation with 3 under 25 years old player is not a reliable rotation in a playoffs which means they have to sign a vet C anyway ( Marc Gasol) with the MLE which mske them pay 25 mil in total for Centers( the money gets bigger when you take into account luxury tax) while they are still lacking athletic Wings. Not to mention the only way they gonna get a wing then is through the 17 mil TPE, there are 2 guys suit the money and what the warriors need and the trade partner may be willing to trade them who are Kelly Oubre or Rudy Gay, still not gonna solve their problems"
13579,2020-09-30 18:46:33,j2kcez,Yea but he's also going to be 24 in February. That's why I'd take him in the later part of the draft since he's closer to his ceiling than the other guys
13580,2020-09-30 20:54:07,j2kcez,"Ideally they trade up for Hayes or Okongwu.

But if they keep all 3, I think the absolute optimal realistic draft for us is 

14. Maxey

26. Riller

30. Tillman 

That would give us 3 positive rotation players out of the gate, all of which immediately slot into roles the Celtics need filled. I think Maxey is a really good fit playing off of Tatum, Tillman could be our closing bigman, and Riller is IMO the best scorer in this draft. He could legit carry bench lineups for us offensively."

13582,2020-09-30 15:18:59,j2kcez,"I guess i sort of assumed he would maybe be slotted as a ball handling 3, facilitating to some of the more talented guards? Maybe I didn‚Äôt think that through, but I would think if they took him theyd rather have Rozier starting alongside Melo than Bridges. 

I also don‚Äôt think Hornets would touch Ball, FWIW."
13583,2020-09-30 12:17:42,j2kcez,At first I was a bit sceptical because I wasn't so knowledgeable of the second round. But after some research and seeing the strawpolls doing fairly well I came to the conclusion that I could probably continue and as it seems I will continue on with the second round.
13584,2020-09-30 12:34:56,j2kcez,"As we see basically this community believes that the Celtics will stash the picks, since the selected Pokusevski at 14 and Bolmaro at 26 who many said will play on Europe for some years and the player they'd keep is Tyler Bey. 

I'd like it if we selected a solid backup player at 14 and then trading the other picks+assets for someone like Jalen Smith.

It is indeed an exciting draft, we have many picks and many assets to do basically anything that we want. The only thing I don't want to see us do is drafting even more young and raw prospects that won't get playtime."
13585,2020-10-04 22:17:44,j2kcez,I want Tyrell Terry at 14 and trade for a big.
13586,2020-09-30 23:14:21,j2kcez,"hope it helps distract you from all the stress

focusing in on something like this can be a good outlet

hope things start looking up soon"
13587,2020-09-30 19:01:47,j2kcez,If he‚Äôs giving you that production on a rookie contract and is close to his ceiling you‚Äôre basically getting prime production at a bargain instead of hoping Maxey shows enough flashes to maybe do what Riller does offensively at 23. I‚Äôve never understood the age/ceiling talk because prime production on a rookie scale is still the most valuable thing in the sport team building wise.
13588,2020-10-01 04:57:32,j2kcez,"I just started looking at the prospects for this years draft so I‚Äôm behind a bit. Riller looks super impressive to me. His first step and finishing are elite and his handle is super smooth. He‚Äôs not really undersized or a bad shooter or anything so why‚Äôs he projected so low? I feel like I‚Äôm missing something here. I know he‚Äôs old for the draft but this guy looks like an absolute stud. His penetration against zone defenses (which I think the nba will start seeing a lot more of) would be perfect for the Celtics. 

I feel like teams get so caught up in the age thing sometimes that they overlook great prospects.."
13589,2020-09-30 18:40:04,j2kcez,"Thanks man, appreciate it."
13590,2020-09-30 13:20:36,j2kcez,"I see I see. I thought you guys do this frequently.


This is really fun."
13591,2020-09-30 14:42:27,j2kcez,"I agree with you. I think 14 is a really good chance for the Cs to find a high end role player which they sorely need. People look at the top of the roster and think we have the ability to take a huge risk here, but I think Danny probably just wants to find a PG or C that can play 10 minutes out of the gate and develop as the year progresses."
13592,2020-09-30 19:07:15,j2kcez,"At pick 27 his age is not a problem. But I wouldn't take Riller at pick 8. 

But I would take Maxey at 8.

Also idk what you're trying to argue. I said I wouldn't mind Riller"
13593,2020-10-01 05:04:56,j2kcez,">so why‚Äôs he projected so low? I feel like I‚Äôm missing something here.

A lot of really smart draft twitter people have him in the lottery on their big boards. 

But nope you aren‚Äôt missing anything, people are just overthinking it and putting way to much stock in the age and comp lvl. 

The thing is, if a guy can play he can play, Riller‚Äôs skills and athleticism would translate wherever he played, he‚Äôs that dynamic. Sure you aren‚Äôt projecting much development because he‚Äôs 23 already, but who cares?? He‚Äôs already good enough to a very good NBA scorer. 

He checks all the boxes offensively, whoever gets him (hoping to god it‚Äôs the Celtics) is gonna be really happy."
13594,2020-09-30 13:24:55,j2kcez,"Actually I'm quite new to this sub. At first I thought that something like that would be done, but since I didn't find anything related I took the initiative to start this. I can say I'm really happy with how things have turned out and it's really fun making this as well."
13595,2020-09-30 14:56:06,j2kcez,"Exactly, team needs right now is more valuable than developing prospects. I'd rather a ten year solid role player than to gamble for a prospect and wait for development."
13596,2020-10-01 05:11:17,j2kcez,Let‚Äôs hope Ainge grabs him. I really hope he doesn‚Äôt draft a raw prospect who doesn‚Äôt really know how to play basketball and is years away from contributing. ü§û
13597,2020-09-30 14:40:10,j2kcez,"I think it was great. Probably will be some odd picks when we look back, but it creates good discussion for each selection and highlights some prospects that aren‚Äôt talked about as much. I can see this being a yearly thing so nice job."
13598,2020-10-02 03:35:59,j2kcez,"Oh wow. I thought you are an old timer. Nice work
man. I was new too. Just noticed your post when it was  Pelican‚Äôs pick @ 13.


Can‚Äôt wait for the second round. Hope people here could help you with players list in the second round."
13599,2020-10-01 05:15:09,j2kcez,"So many ways this draft could go, really don‚Äôt know what direction Ainge will go. Just gotta trust him and the FO to do their due diligence and learn from this last playoff run."

13615,2020-09-30 05:34:56,j2d03h,Why are you assuming you'll lose man
13616,2020-09-30 13:27:10,j2d03h,"That was my thinking, if game 6/7 were close-ish games and no Star really drove/dominated play like Perry did in game 5, I would not have been surprised if Point/Hedman still got serious votes maybe a win over a Star.

Perry/Pavelski though had strong shots especially after game 5. If Dobby got a shutout and/or stole a game or two he'd have a chance but I think him cooling off made it Perry/Pavelski"
13617,2020-09-30 12:43:47,j2d03h,Lets not forget Miro is a DEFENSEMAN. On a team that has been starved for offense all year. Something clicked after the round robin games and he was the driving force behind that.

13619,2020-09-30 04:35:01,j2d03h,not if it was close or if we came back late. the voting is during 2nd intermission if I'm not mistaken?
13620,2020-09-30 05:39:49,j2d03h,"not sure if this is an asshole comment or you're legitimately asking why I would think we would still not get the Conn Smythe had we won. If it is the latter, I think you have to look at hedman and point unless dobby or miro have an outrageous end to game 7."
13621,2020-09-30 05:23:47,j2d03h,"In game 7s the voters can effectively submit two ballots by saying ""If team X wins, my three choices are..., but if team Y wins, my three choices are...""."

13623,2020-09-30 09:20:18,j2d03h,"Wow, didn't know that.

I always wondered why they were so good at picking the winner in close games."
13624,2020-09-30 05:25:00,j2d03h,"well, nbc surely said it differently. dunno why I am surprised."
13625,2020-09-30 05:46:57,j2d03h,"nah, I was talking about if we pushed a game 7 and managed to win at the end in our series. when you look at the point totals/team drivers and the general dominance of those guys on your squad it would seem possible to still give it to hedman or point even if they lost."
13626,2020-09-30 05:49:11,j2d03h,"Idk if the NHL would do that but of course I wouldn't be mad. I would still *hope* Miro would win, especially since it would put Dallas in a really good spotlight for National broadcasts."

13638,2020-09-26 12:06:16,j0490u,"The Knicks just need to take BPA here and to me that comes down to Bey, Nnaji, Joe, and Riller. 

As I‚Äôve said multiple times in these by now, not totally sold on Bey and I would guess that they hunt a PG pretty aggressively in Free Agency so give me one of Joe or Nnaji. 

I like each for pretty different reasons. I think joe is probably the best shooter in the class with potential for defensive contributions (long and has shown some upside) and if there‚Äôs one thing the Knicks young wings can‚Äôt do its shoot. 

Nnaji on the other hand I‚Äôm pretty confident would fit well next to Robinson long term as a stretch 4 who looks to be fairly switchable. I frankly think he was misused at Arizona and should have been shooting the ball much more.

I would take Nnaji but if someone were to take one of the other four I‚Äôd have no complaints."

I tend to forget about Sat 2 and listen to Sat 3 more.

I dont find Sat1 to have many outstanding tracks, though GOLD has grown on me again. But like you say. HEAT is a fucken banger. It's the stand out track on Sat 1.

Ginger is a hard one for me to rank cause you gotta be in the right mood for it, and when you are, its brilliant. But if your not, it changes your emotion. J think lyrically its outstanding. Joba on BIG BOY and LOVE ME FOR LIFE  is some of his best work.

13684,2020-11-09 06:50:51,jqfwu8,"Wiseman to the Wolves really doesn't make a ton of sense. To get Wiseman out there on offense, you're gonna have to relegate him to being a basic rim-runner, or relegate KAT to being a spot-up shooter. Wiseman, theoretically, can develop to be a shooting big, with the ability to score from three and from mid-range. However, he'll need the ball a lot and need chances to make mistakes in order to develop those shots; that requires taking the ball out of KAT's hands. If you keep Wiseman as a simple rim-runner, then he isn't the BPA; Wiseman's status as the BPA in this draft is based on his combination of high floor + high ceiling, but ignoring the ceiling makes him irrelevant. Then there's a wealth of defensive issues: KAT can't hang with PFs on defense, he struggles to defend Cs, he's definitely not quick or proactive enough to defend a small-ball PF like Tatum, Robert Covington, or PG13. That means you're switching Wiseman onto PFs or smaller every time, and, while he has that kind of defensive potential, that's a big ask for a rookie. After all that, his trade value probably won't be high, because he'll have wasted valuable development years and not shone the potential that's currently so coveted."

13687,2020-11-08 17:52:26,jqfwu8,"Cole Anthony way too high, Pat Williams too low. Theo Maledon and Tre Jones too high, Jalen Smith too low.

&#x200B;

Cole Anthony is absolutely not a riser on draft boards by any definition and has in fact fallen the farthest of virtually any prospect as he was ranked #1-3 on most boards coming into the college year.

&#x200B;

These PGs are fungible, none of them move the needle. 20's and onwards for any PG that isn't Ball/Hayes/Haliburton/Lewis."
13688,2020-11-09 00:13:22,jqfwu8,GSW isn't drafting a guard unless they trade him.
13689,2020-11-08 19:21:21,jqfwu8,"Find It hard to believe ATL passes on Deni. They like Haliburton, but switchable wing defenders  is top priority"
13690,2020-11-09 07:27:12,jqfwu8,Perhaps Minnesota wants a forward (Deni or Toppin( but doesn't want to draft them numbero uno.  Cleveland will probably have a choice of either if the USC center is drafted ahead of them.  The Cavs could swap Wiseman for Toppin plus throw in some other kind of compensation.....Milwaukee's' number one in 2021 and some cash and both sides win.   Cleveland's owner owns Rocket Mortgage is talked about as being the second richest owner.  He's not shy about spending money if it'll improve them
13691,2020-11-08 18:44:26,jqfwu8,i mean he was a top 3 pic a long time ago. Maybe hes talking about him rising from the 20's to the teens.
13692,2020-11-08 17:58:10,jqfwu8,You‚Äôre seeing people mock Cole Anthony to Pheonix and even the Knicks. I‚Äôm not sold on him going that high but he is rising.
13693,2020-11-09 02:48:59,jqfwu8,"So in this case, is Deni the pick?"
13694,2020-11-08 18:50:27,jqfwu8,I'd bet money Cole doesn't go in the teens
13695,2020-11-08 18:01:51,jqfwu8,"Firstly, he isn't rising he has fallen and may slide further. If someone mocks Cole to the Knicks, that's good shorthand for they don't know what the hell they are doing. I don't care what you are sold on, no well-placed source has Cole anywhere near the lottery. Chances are Kira Lewis goes before he does."
13696,2020-11-09 06:02:11,jqfwu8,"I think either Deni, Wiseman... or a trade down and out where they trade down for a lower pick+ maybe an additional second or first and then send that out for a border line star or talented PF or C.

I think a good option if it would work cap wise would be trading down to the Pistons for a sign trade for Christian Wood and including  some of the guys that ran the floor this last season but aren‚Äôt really good enough to stay around."

13706,2020-11-07 18:13:19,jptps7,"The more I watch Spike and think about him, I think he‚Äôs among the very best filmmakers of all time. He has an uneven track record, especially his early 2010s stuff isn‚Äôt all great. But he has some really incredible films and i think is fully justified to lose his shit over his two best picture snubs.

He has a LOT of good films that people don‚Äôt talk about. Clockers, Crooklyn, 25th Hour, Get on the Bus, Mo Better Blues.

I think he‚Äôs a true visionary who is not afraid to try new things and he‚Äôs still working as hard as ever to be an artist."
13707,2020-11-07 23:22:36,jptps7,">Clockers

He did the best he could, but that novel can't be turned into a two hour film without sacrificing the layers and details that made it so fascinating.

Part of me wants to see it get rebooted with a limited series treatment. But after The Wire -- which had several episodes written by Clockers author Richard Price -- it might come off as redundant, or even greeted with a shrug. A shame. The book is a classic."

Billy woods- spongebob, houthi, red dust (all of these are from his best album hiding places, but I think all his albums are great)

13716,2020-11-04 23:02:06,jo6yaw,"This leads me to my unpopular opinion.  The Jackie Chan movie that has scenes in China should not have been called the Karate Kid.  It should have been called the Kung Fu Kid.  

Also, I disagree.  The original was great."
13717,2020-11-04 23:06:25,jo6yaw,Get tf out of here with that nonsense. Pat Morita won a damn Oscar you unfrosted poptart
13718,2020-11-04 23:02:31,jo6yaw,"Let's compare the two.

One was a low-budget 80s movie that no one knew about at all that had nothing to measure up against that people ended up loving and becoming an important pillar in the cinematic retelling of underdog story. Daniel son was kind of known from the Outsiders. Pat Morita was on happy days.

The other is a high-budget studio remake that already had the framework and nostalgia of the original to work against. Not to mention, arguably the most famous foreign action star that's alive as mr. Miyagi and the son of one of the most iconic actors that have ever lived as Daniel Son. None of those things were in the original and it still is better and more beloved.

Even with all of that without the low-budget 80s movie your movie wouldn't even exist.

I'll give you an upvote because your opinion is unpopular but I also think it's objectively wrong.

Also that wire fighting special move at the end is fucking trash I'll take a regular crane kick any day from the original."

Are you super high or Advija or just think GSW needs the wing depth? I would also rather POR go for Achiuwa if he‚Äôs up and if they‚Äôre going guard idk if they want a project like Hampton; Maxey or Maledon would be much better picks I think. Nice mock tho!

13769,2020-11-04 16:17:21,jnzema,"I follow the draft year around, this year has been weird though with Covid and less leaks.  I like the NBA offseason just as much as the season."
13770,2020-11-04 16:30:12,jnzema,His range looks to be 4-10 likely more towards 10.  I put him in at 11 as a BPA pick because he was falling in my draft and I didn't see him slipping anymore.
13771,2020-11-04 16:27:42,jnzema,I 100% agree.  Could be a lot of trading since the draft is so wide open because people will want to grab the guy they like.
13772,2020-11-04 16:22:12,jnzema,"He likely goes late 1st may even go as high as late lottery. The thing with Poku is his buy out varies depending on where he is picked if he goes in the teens or higher it is 1.5mil, 20s it is 1mil, and 2nd round it is only 500,000 so he may drop because of his buyouts sliding scale."
13773,2020-11-04 18:27:01,jnzema,He probably goes to OKC at pick 25
13774,2020-11-04 17:15:10,jnzema,Could be someone trades up to take Ball there more of a BPA pick.  Bulls could use an upgrade at PG and Ball is the best PG in the draft.
13775,2020-11-04 17:53:21,jnzema,yeah I was going to say it‚Äôs highly unlikely we take a pg when we have Coby Kris and sato already... I see us taking Deni if he‚Äôs still there Okoro would be a stretch with that pick but I‚Äôd also be happy with a 3&D guy cuz we need perimeter defenders desperately.
13776,2020-11-04 18:29:46,jnzema,"
>not bad for the Knicks either

It's pretty bad for us. Haliburton at 8 isn't that bad but Nico and Paul Reed aren't it for us.

At pick 27, Tyler Bey or Jah'mius Ramsey are much better players and fits.

At pick 38 Isaiah Joe or Jordan Nwora fit much better"
13777,2020-11-04 18:08:37,jnzema,"Avidija seems to be moving to the top of the draft and legit could go #1.  I think C is biggest need for Warriors so Wiseman makes sense there, but have read they like Deni more, which also makes sense he could plug in at the 4 and Draymond moves to the 5 to give Warriors their new Death Lineup."
13778,2020-11-04 19:37:21,jnzema,Stanley is a mid 2nd rounder that would be a reach to take him in the 1st.  If Lakers like him they have been known to buy into the 2nd round to grab guys.
13779,2020-11-04 20:27:36,jnzema,"20 is too high to take Flynn and Quickley.  

I haven't seen Anthony linked to Miami, but I have seen Smith linked to them.  Miami could use some depth down low and Smith fits the mold as a guy that can stretch the floor and defend.  I think Smith goes late lottery to early 20s so he is also a BPA  pick since he is towards the end of his draft range.  I think Anthony has a range in the early to mid 20s."
13780,2020-11-04 23:12:03,jnzema,He will go in the 5-10 range would give the Suns a stretch 4 which they wanted with Saric who underperformed.  Williams best comparison is Danilo Gallinari offensively but he is a much better defender and a crazy athlete.
13781,2020-11-29 01:22:25,jnzema,"My Final Mock Was  Little Better Had 8 correct picks, 50/60 drafted correct, 26/30 1st rounders correct."
13782,2020-11-04 22:36:03,jnzema,Cavs haven't drafted for need the past few years and Toppin is clearly the BPA at their pick plus their frontcourt is the oldest part of their roster.
13783,2020-11-04 18:26:36,jnzema,"I was going to post mine yesterday than my computer restarted and I lost everything. 

But just to comment on the Knicks stuff.

Knicks want a shot creator at 8 if they go PG, and they really like Okoro. They've taken a huge liking to Kira as well. So Kira and Okoro would probably be over Haliburton since the fit is worse and there's less interest.

As for pick 27, Nico Mannion is not it. He's not it. I gotta stress that he's not it. He's projected 2nd round to undrafted, he's not going to 27 to the Knicks. The Knicks can't play 4 point guards (DSJ, Frank, Nico, Haliburton).

Tyler Bey, Ramsey, Joe, and Nwora would all be much much better fits, players, and fill a need for the Knicks."
13784,2020-11-04 19:43:40,jnzema,"It sounds like the Cavs FO is very high on him. If Deni is off the table, I'd be surprised if we don't take Okoro."
13785,2020-11-04 16:36:15,jnzema,"I see someone like Devin Vassell and think they could be the next elite 3&D guy (which is extremely valuable) but I don‚Äôt think they could become a superstar.

I actually think Toppin can be an all-star if he hasn‚Äôt peaked already"
13786,2020-11-04 19:35:35,jnzema,I have seen him linked there as well.
13787,2020-11-04 18:16:42,jnzema,"None of those is good enough to build around.

LaMelo may be.

This high you always take BPA, unless you're absolutely set for years to come imo."
13788,2020-11-04 18:39:26,jnzema,"Yeah I just saw Haliburton and didn‚Äôt think too much lol I love what that guy can bring to the table for them

I‚Äôm a UA fan and I don‚Äôt even like Mannion that much he‚Äôs not very good shooting off the dribble or finishing around the rim I see him right now as playmaking as his only plus skill with it mainly being relegated to playmaking in the open court which I don‚Äôt see Thibodeau embracing 

Ramsey would be best at that pick for them bc they need shooting and a guy that can hound on defense 

I do like Paul Reed (even though we only saw him playing at DePaul) he kinda reminds me of a guy in the mold of a young Javale however I just wasn‚Äôt really thinking about their situation I need to do my homework on Joe and Nwora but Perry is a guy I really like

I think the main thing for them is getting playmakers and shooting around RJ so he can do what he does best which is get to the rim 

I think Bolmaro could be a nice sleeper pick in the second round for them too"
13789,2020-11-04 18:42:44,jnzema,I think what we‚Äôre hearing from GSW is a lot of smoke and mirrors they can really do whatever they want with that pick bc if they‚Äôre back healthy next season they‚Äôre a contender in the playoffs so I think the guy they go for is high upside and I just see Wiseman as being that guy
13790,2020-11-04 23:50:04,jnzema,klutch guy
13791,2020-11-04 23:13:12,jnzema,"No shit? 

Drop knowledge then, I‚Äôll check him out. 

I don‚Äôt remember seeing a his name until now."
13792,2020-11-29 01:38:13,jnzema,lol i was only counting the first 30 lol
13793,2020-11-04 22:46:40,jnzema,"Yeah. But they've got Drummond, Thompson, Nance, and Love. And they've shown a willingness to pay vets to keep the locker room from going to trash."
13794,2020-11-04 19:34:04,jnzema,Mannion is projected to go last 1st to late 2nd so I don't know where you have seen him as a 2nd round to undrafted guy.  I agree not a great fit for the Knicks put him there more as I see that pick getting traded by the Knicks.
13795,2020-11-04 16:38:32,jnzema,Vassell I think will be similar to Matisse Thybulle so like an Andre Roberson type player.  Toppin reminds me of Amare Stoudemire.
13796,2020-11-04 18:18:49,jnzema,Well I‚Äôm not guaranteed that LaMelo is a sure fire thing... Yeah the playmaking is nice but he is allergic to defense and we don‚Äôt have many defenders on the roster outside of Dunn and Carter... I believe LaMelo will be a solid player just not in Chicago.
13797,2020-11-04 19:42:00,jnzema,I see Paul Reed as a Darrell Arthur type player.
13798,2020-11-04 19:40:07,jnzema,Wiseman doesn't really have great upside to me I see him as a Hassan Whiteside type player.   Onyeka Okongwu I believe has the higher upside of the Centers who are supposed to go high in the draft.  Okongwu I see as a Bam Adebayo type player.
13799,2020-11-05 00:44:16,jnzema,"[https://nbadraft.theringer.com/](https://nbadraft.theringer.com/) \#16 on their big board.

13800,2020-11-04 23:08:39,jnzema,"Thompson is a free agent he could stay but just as likely to go chase a ring.

Drummond could opt out probably doesn't would be stupid to because he won't get that money on market so he stays.

Love is always being shopped."
13801,2020-11-04 19:52:29,jnzema,Mannion was projected late 1st early 2nd like 4 months ago. His stock continued to fall since then. I havent seen any mocks in the past 2 months that had him in the 1st round
13802,2020-11-04 17:22:37,jnzema,"Vassell can actually shoot and dribble, though."
13803,2020-11-04 18:28:03,jnzema,LaMelo's on ball defense is poor but his help defense improved a lot over seas. He'll be fine. His size at 6'7 with a 6'10 wingspan help that
13804,2020-11-04 19:55:32,jnzema,"I see more athleticism out of him than Darrell Arthur, but less of Arthur's faceup game, making me think he's gonna be used more in the nba for his ability in the open court as a rim runner. I think Reed is in that same vein of role player as Arthur which is still great value that late in the draft."
13805,2020-11-04 20:08:23,jnzema,Okongwu reminds me of Clint Capela with some offensive versatility on the low block. I think Wiseman's floor is Whiteside. His offensive game is more versatile than Okongwu. I think his first year he'll pretty much be a rim runner but he has good form and some range so a nice base to work from. And you can't teach 7'1 and that kind of athleticism.
13806,2020-11-05 01:25:52,jnzema,"Thompson will re-sign at a favorable rate. And if Lil Kev wants to play for a contender, he‚Äôs going to need to restructure his deal. Drummond is taking the option."
13807,2020-11-04 20:05:52,jnzema,"He was lottery months ago and yes he has fallen, but here is [NBAdraft.net](https://NBAdraft.net) mock from yesterday and they have one of the most accurate mocks along with the DraftExpress/ESPN guys every year.  He is #23.

13808,2020-11-04 17:37:37,jnzema,"He can shoot, but he needs to improve his ballhandling to be able to create his shot at the NBA level."
13809,2020-11-04 20:23:30,jnzema,Nbadraft.net is notorious for having some of the most inaccurate mocks ever
13810,2020-11-04 20:29:49,jnzema,"Throughout the year it may not be accurate, but they get it dialed in the week or two leading up to the draft and their final mock is always pretty close.  This years draft is one of the biggest crap shoots in awhile so it will be interesting.  I am not saying I am a huge Mannion fan I think he is a lot like Landry Shamet."
13811,2020-11-04 16:19:41,jnz7qn,[deleted]
13812,2020-11-04 17:18:14,jnz7qn,I'm okay with okoro :)
13813,2020-11-05 02:35:53,jnz7qn,As a Celtics fan I‚Äôm cool with this
13814,2020-11-04 20:38:12,jnz7qn,Don't think NY takes Mannion at 27 when there's a shit ton of proven point guards with much better measurables. You take Mannion if you're hoping he can eventually lead the second unit.
13815,2020-11-05 04:03:29,jnz7qn,"I like this draft for Philly. Getting Cole Anthony would be ideal at the OKC pick, as he gives us a young PG who excel's at OTD shooting. Zeke Nnaji would be a good pick aswell if Malachi Flynn dosen't fall. The things I'd change would be picking Isaiah Joe at 36, Mason Jones at 49, and Nate Hinton at 58."
13816,2020-11-05 17:57:01,jnz7qn,I know it's fashionable to mock Toppin to the Cavs.  I think they do like Obi but can't take him with Love on the roster for at least 2 more years.  No I don't think they deal Love (might not be able to either without giving up assets which they won't do).  There are just not enough minutes available for Toppin who probably needs to play now at age 22.
13817,2020-11-04 16:25:45,jnz7qn,I could def see them take Wiseman I just have seen recently they are higher on Deni.  Should be a lot of trading this draft since it is so wide open.
13818,2020-11-04 16:27:21,jnz7qn,[deleted]
13819,2020-11-04 16:32:07,jnz7qn,I mean reports are Deni could realistically go #1 to Minnesota so trading down to get him may not workout for them if that is who they really want.
13820,2020-11-04 15:10:52,jnyauu,"Sorry , Title is Bleacher Report , My fault ."
13821,2020-11-04 17:06:54,jnyauu,">By all accounts, Ball isn't the type to charm his way through an interview. But unless he completely turned the Wolves' executives off, the meeting was presumably just a formality, and his words and answers shouldn't factor too heavily into their overall evaluation."
13822,2020-11-04 18:33:37,jnyauu,"No Theo Maledon instead of Mannion or wc Pritchard? 6-4 2001born PG with Euroleague experience, high IQ. he would be a steal in the late 1st but I can't imagine him going 2nd round."

13825,2020-11-04 16:05:57,jnyauu,There‚Äôs nooo way Detroit takes Pat Williams with Killian on the board.
13826,2020-11-04 15:55:13,jnyauu,"Is this based on rumors or just intuition? I guess this is a fine mock on the whole but Nnaji that early surprises me and Pritchard in the first is ridiculous imo. Idk why the Heat would grab a mobile big like Nnaji when they already have Bam; you'd think they'd look for a shooting big (slim pickings with Smith off the board) or more of a bruiser (probably too early for Carey/Stewart/Oturu) but idk. PatWill to the Pistons is kinda surprising I just assumed they'd go with Killian if he's there but it's nice to see Williams stock rise (even though I think 7 is too early for him).

Maxey/Cole/Hampton all going that late seems kinda crazy, but at this point anything's possible. I guess I can see one or two of them falling, but all three is wild when they're all lottery talents imo. Feels like a certainty that at least one of them will be a steal if they all go that late."
13827,2020-11-04 16:43:45,jnyauu,"Man I really can‚Äôt pin down where Terry is going. I either see him to Boston at 14, Philly at 21, or Dallas in the 30s. like wtf 

I think the sixers should take him if he‚Äôs there, but Vecenie did make a good point yesterday about being cautious taking him there. they kind of need a guy that can contribute soon in some way and idk if Terry is that guy yet"
13828,2020-11-04 17:05:17,jnyauu,If Cole and Maxey fall that far I think the Sixers should take one of them.

Redditors: ""Nope. Impossible. Wrong.""

Every year people say ""don't draft for need"" and then get annoyed when mock drafts have teams picking someone that doesn't fill an immediate need. I don't know what will happen, but if Detroit thinks Pat Williams is the better prospect, they will likely take him."
13836,2020-11-04 17:25:32,jnyauu,I think people are getting higher on Williams overall seems a bit similar to when rui rose up last year. They similar prospects too
13837,2020-11-04 19:06:33,jnyauu,"Nnaji is a good shooter for a big, he was just not allowed to on Arizona. Hes gonna go a lot higher than people expect, lots of potential as a modern big."

13839,2020-11-04 16:32:53,jnyauu,Knicks aren‚Äôt trading Robinson and the 8th pick for the 2nd pick.
13840,2020-11-04 16:02:29,jnyauu,"Probably a lot of trading in this draft, but Atlanta could def use another big on their roster that can space the floor and defend.  Their depth up front is not that great."
13841,2020-11-04 17:35:14,jnyauu,"Well shit, you‚Äôre right about not knowing what will happen. Players are being projected all over the place, nobody knows what the hell is gonna happen. That‚Äôs what makes this years draft so exciting. 

Since it‚Äôs such a crapshoot, a lot of the discussion on this sub is based on conjecture and personal bias, it‚Äôs just natural.

In this case, I see Killian as not only the better fit, but the better talent for the Pistons, so I would be very surprised if he wasn‚Äôt taken in that scenario. I could totally be wrong, saying ‚Äúno way‚Äù was an exaggeration on my part. This draft is one of my favorites in recent memory just because it‚Äôll be such a challenge to accurately predict it, anything could happen."

13844,2020-11-04 16:31:07,jnyauu,Dedmon is an adequate backup center and I think the assumption is the hawks sign skal as a backup 4. With Bruno fernando as the 5th big. It's not amazing but far from a major need. Unless the hawks see a big as the bpa and there are no good trades I don't see us taking one.
13845,2020-11-06 19:33:38,jnyauu,"Honestly just Google it, the coach didn't want him taking 3 point shots in college."
13846,2020-11-04 17:08:19,jnyauu,"LaMelo isn‚Äôt a sure thing. Knicks need as much talent as possible, not to condense into unknown players with high ceilings but low floors. 

Plus, Mitch shows flashes of jumpers in practice. If his offensive game expands to include a league average corner three, he has the potential to be gobert with a jumper. That‚Äôs a pretty great ceiling."
13847,2020-11-04 16:34:23,jnyauu,I mean they have been shopping John Collins as well.  I think Okongwu and Killian Hayes are the best players at this pick to me Okongwu makes more sense for the Hawks.
13848,2020-11-04 17:24:26,jnyauu,[deleted]
13849,2020-11-04 16:41:23,jnyauu,Okongwu would be an okay pick if the FO thinks he's the best player. I wouldn't hate it but I also don't think John is getting traded unless a star becomes available.
13850,2020-11-04 17:27:56,jnyauu,"Nah our new front office is preaching to take it slow and do it right. Lamelo ain't the answer to our woes. We need to keep as many assets as possible to see what pans out and hope that we can build a base that attracts free agents. 

At least thats what the front office is saying. We will see if they hold true to their word (for once.)"

1. The Hornets are likely targeting a big man and are heavily considering Okongwu. Also there are many NBA front offices that prefer Okongwu to Wiseman.
2. Deni Avdija could be the playmaker the Bulls covet.
3. The Celtics have offered their three first-round picks (nos. 14, 26, and 30) in trades to try and move up but nobody bites that offer so far.
4. The Magic are attempting to move up into the lottery.
5. Zeke Nnaji is receiving interest from teams in the late teens and 20s.
6. Aleksej Pokusevski has been connected to the Thunder for weeks."

In a vacuum, I like moving up to grab a player with top 3 upside in the draft, but when that player can‚Äôt be on the court with your (injured) franchise player who you won‚Äôt be able to trade due to his inflated contract, it‚Äôs flawed. On top of that, I don‚Äôt see them bailing on Brown this early on his rookie deal. He‚Äôs shown upside and you need cheap production with Walls albatross of a deal. Trading 2 of those (brown + 9) for 1 (6), isn‚Äôt wise."

It‚Äôs hard to say what can still happen up until the draft but Okongwu rising and Ball falling seem consistent with the widespread steam.

I don't believe KOC has significant reporting chops (not that I do) but I suspect this comment misstates how draft day deals come together. Why would, say, ATL ""bite"" if they believed the offer would remain until minutes before they pick? Will NYK offer #8 & #27 for #6, if the right guy is sitting at #6?  ATL potentially benefits from waiting, though of course there's a risk BOS clinches a deal with DET before the draft, or with CLE at the draft.

BOS pretty much completed the Philly trade (#1 for #3+) a week before the draft, but the #1 pick has different factors. I don't believe any notable pick-only first round trades not including the #1 pick occur two weeks out. Does anyone remember such a deal being finalized or leaked so early?"

KOC does situational mocks. So this isn't saying Ball will fall, it's just saying he might (because of interviews/workouts) and this is how the draft could play out if he does."

He‚Äôs faster than everyone on the court on the break, where he excels with his decision making. His jumper isn‚Äôt as wet as KD‚Äôs or MPJ‚Äôs, but it‚Äôs silky smooth just the same. He‚Äôs got handles. He‚Äôs got size. His BBIQ is incredible. His positioning and BBIQ will make him at worst an above average defender from the first day.

13926,2020-11-03 16:45:15,jnc86q,Philly‚Äôs biggest issue by far was shot creation. They were actually decent on catch n shoot 3s. They struggled with off the dribble 3s.

Yeah, but players who can self create, create advantages, and playmake on the pereimiter is a much bigger issue. The only player on our team who can self create is Alec Burks, who is probably not coming back this season. And I don't really think our PnR play is that good to the point not to target self creation at the OKC pick. Plus Cole is a pretty good shooter aswell, and is better at both than Green.

Pretty much"

I get the quoted Wizards exec when they say they are in a place to ‚Äútake a swing‚Äù but Ball feels more like a dice throw than a swing (Hayes or Vassel).

13942,2020-11-03 16:07:39,jnc86q,No it wouldn‚Äôt. The Wizards need a guy who can contribute now and desperately need a big man who can defend. Not a pg who can‚Äôt shoot or defend.
13943,2020-11-04 01:36:09,jnc86q,"I always appreciate perspective, I agree that Hali improved but I just don't buy him as someone who can REALLY create for himself at the NBA level.

13946,2020-11-04 00:04:01,jnc86q,That's the my exact point. Maybe because I read and watch Precios more than the other but I love his attitude a lot and I think would perfectly fit here.
13947,2020-11-03 19:39:04,jnc86q,"would you rather draft for need on a team that has the worst record in the league since LBJ left?

We've got to go BPA till we land a star"
13948,2020-11-03 16:22:27,jnc86q,"OK , I got it"
13949,2020-11-03 16:25:51,jnc86q,We need a lead playmaker. Okoro is extremely underrated as a playmaker and he can be a top 10 defender in the NBA. His upside is massive.
13950,2020-11-03 18:43:35,jnc86q,"Lol @ faster than everyone on the court on the break.

He shouldn‚Äôt be talked about with him because he doesn‚Äôt possess their upside."
13951,2020-11-03 19:27:22,jnc86q,"Personally, I think I'm settling at 

1.Hayes

2.Ball

3.Avdija

4.Haliburton

5.Okoro"
13952,2020-11-03 18:23:25,jnc86q,"Most bulls fans seem to want Ball, Hayes or Deni. Hope we pass on Ball myself, I see bust all over him. I'd prefer Hayes or Okoro but I'd be ok with Deni."
13953,2020-11-12 12:36:02,jnc86q,"Haliburton is just a very odd player to me. No doubt productive in college, but I don‚Äôt see him having as much success on the next level with his jumpshot as it is now. 98th percentile off the catch and 35th percentile off the bounce is troubling.

Vassell is fine, but I see no star power. Just a solid role player. His shot has also looked really bad in workouts and has gotten even further behind his head."
13954,2020-11-03 20:29:28,jnc86q,He's from Rochester lol
13955,2020-11-05 13:23:53,jnc86q,Precisely why
13956,2020-11-03 21:29:06,jnc86q,"Do you remember a picks-only trade being completed or all but completed more than two weeks before the draft? I do not believe there are any ""bites"" to be had. But me asking you that question isn't the point -- KOC didn't provide that context. If he is reporting what he is hearing, he still isn't providing context. Thus ""chops."""
13957,2020-11-03 20:04:29,jnc86q,"Lmao honestly. I think its that ppl on this sub, or maybe just ""draft nerds"" in general, have these unrealistically optimistic takes on late-lottery-and-beyond prospects (Desmond Bane can be Malcolm Brogdon, Aaron Nesmith is JJ Redick, etc.) so they basically see it as more opportunities to hit on a ""star"". 

In reality at #26 and #30 youre lucky if you get an NBA rotation player. Theres a reason teams are turning down that Celtics package"
13958,2020-11-03 23:19:52,jnc86q,"You know this is actually a very rational take I hadn‚Äôt thought of as much and I guess it depends on how much this pistons FO values the later draft. I agree though, we will sucks for a few years regardless so mine as well try and get as many stars as possible. Stars win championships and we have a better chance of drafting one top 8 then 16+."
13959,2020-11-03 21:41:33,jnc86q,"I don‚Äôt see Haliburton (or a lot of other guys available at that pick) as a potential star, I see him likely as a really good role player. I‚Äôd rather have more shots at talent in this draft than a consolidated asset, when star power is so lacking here. 14 could easily be Tyrese Maxey or Kira Lewis and 26 could be Desmond Bane or Grant Riller (just looking at some guard prospects I like and am familar with). I probably take the combo of 2 of those guys + the 30th pick over whoever is available at 7.

I agree with you philosophically, I just don‚Äôt think that necessarily holds up in this draft."
13960,2020-11-03 19:39:21,jnc86q,"This sub (and r/nba) would rather have ""assets"" than talent. It was an unpopular opinion to trade the Nets pick (which was used in the Irving trade) for Jimmy Butler. That would be a no brainer move if that was on the table."
13961,2020-11-03 19:47:49,jnc86q,I think the idea is since it‚Äôs almost impossible for a team like Detroit to get a Superstar in free agency it‚Äôs better to take as many swings through the draft as possible and hope you get a late first superstar like a Jokic or Giannis or Jimmy Butler even which is why I said unless you really like the player available at 7
13962,2020-11-03 18:42:02,jnc86q,No thanks
13963,2020-11-03 17:57:40,jnc86q,"yeah, pretty much everyone on the roster outside of Ben can at least hit threes and everyone outside of Ben and Embiid can hit them at a decent rate. we were so bad off the bounce though lol"
13964,2020-11-03 21:36:50,jnc86q,"Yep, we need those guys to shoot at a higher volume for sure, but the bigger issue is not one of those guys can really dribble and create."
13965,2020-11-03 23:23:12,jnc86q,"I am super high on Josh Green, don't get me wrong. I think he's a top 10 pick as well. Just don't think he's a typical Morey pick."
13966,2020-11-03 22:09:55,jnc86q,"He is not a bad player but he clearly isn't a star in the making. I'm on mobile so I can't give a long writeup but he is the same player he was last year just with more trust from the coaching staff as a second year player on a tanking team. Got beat out for a starting job when the carpet was rolled out for him to get it.

I wouldn't dump him in a million years but if we could get a top-3 talent with better team fit I'd do that trade. I just don't think any of the top prospects this year are superstars so I'd stand pat."
13967,2020-11-04 00:01:39,jnc86q,Wall and Ball would hate each other that's for certain. Wall and Austin Rivers were at each other's throats.
13968,2020-11-04 06:42:09,jnc86q,Yea but how much catch and shoot is a high usage player really going to do? His form's issues rely heavily on momentum so he's terrible shooting off the dribble
13969,2020-11-03 19:06:13,jnc86q,"ye i would much rather shooters over Precious.  

there like a 99% chance James Johnson will be better next season than Precious anyway."
13970,2020-11-03 23:17:25,jnc86q,"That was a report from like a week ago, and it said he planned to interview with the other teams in the top 4. Do you really think it's impossible that he interviewed with another couple teams in the last week? 

Also, as far as I know we don't really have any confirmed workouts. All the agents and teams are hiding it. Given Givony and Schmitz's tendency to so favors this time of year, I'm a bit skeptical of their reports."
13971,2020-11-04 21:29:04,jnc86q,"As someone who lives in downtown CLE and goes (or at least tries to go) to Cavs games regularly - please keep Lamelo away from Cleveland.

Drafting a pg in 3 consecutive drafts would earn them certified poverty status, and Lamelo Ball's ceiling isn't as high as people here want it to be. Sexporter is the future I'd much rather see"
13972,2020-11-03 18:09:58,jnc86q,"He's also the highest ceiling player available in this scenario

I think Koby Altman has shown he will go with BPA till we land a star

I think he has also shown he doesn't really believe in Collin Sexton (moving sexton to SG, then drafting KPJ in the first round)

> I‚Äòd much rather prefer a wing like Okoro or Okongwu

I like Okongwu, but he's not a wing, he's a PF/C

My board for the Cavs is as follows, what's yours?

1.) Wiseman

2.) Ball

3.) Edwards

4.) Deni

5.) Okongwu

6.) Okoro

7.) Haliburton

8.) Obi"
13973,2020-11-03 16:38:14,jnc86q,Disagree strongly. Washington has a sinking ship roster that cant do anything for years because of the wall contract. Best talent in the draft would be a steal.
13974,2020-11-03 23:01:39,jnc86q,Gimme okongwu at 6 and I'd like it more
13975,2020-11-03 16:21:33,jnc86q,I don‚Äôt even want to trade TBJ for LaMelo straight up tbh let alone with pick 9 and 37 lol
13976,2020-11-04 04:07:25,jnc86q,"I agree with you on both ends. Hali is very much a two guard that ideally plays next to a ball dominant guard (Fox, Trae Young, Luka, etc.) and helps to ‚Äúsplit‚Äù the offense in two where the Dominant Guard focuses on the weak or strong side of offense and then hockey assists out to Hali for him to the make the actual assist.

Hayes can create for himself to your point and likely can create for others."
13977,2020-11-03 23:13:03,jnc86q,"I think we‚Äôd go Williams, I think we had a top ten offense last season, but our defense was so bad so Toppin would just make our struggles worse."
13978,2020-11-03 20:47:03,jnc86q,"Are you sure you are actually selecting the BPA though? At some point this strategy will begin to fuck up, its not a guarantee. And it will definitely fuck up if you keep drafting over the guy you originally invest in. Because if he doesn't have the minutes and the role to grow, then he can't develop properly. Especially being young PG's adapting to the speed and intelligence of the league."
13979,2020-11-03 19:00:58,jnc86q,"While Okoro may be slightly underrated as a playmaker, he doesn‚Äôt project as even a secondary one. Deni is far, far superior in that regard both now and in projections."
13980,2020-11-03 16:49:31,jnc86q,"I think people are overrating Deni‚Äôs playmaking ability. He has shown great ability as a passer in transition but hasn‚Äôt had as much effectiveness playmaking in the half court. His handle is also mediocre, so I don‚Äôt see him as a viable lead playmaker."
13981,2020-11-03 16:50:26,jnc86q,"Defense doesn't always translate

from DeAndre Hunter to Chris Singleton guys with Okoro's defensive abilities fail in the NBA

My point is I wouldn't peg him as top 10 yet, I do agree if he develops a jumper he could be a Kawhi type"
13982,2020-11-03 20:26:42,jnc86q,"He's definitely one of the faster players end to end that I've seen at his size. Wouldnt say faster than everyone on the court (on the Bulls for example Coby White and Lavine would be) but yeah he's gonna be tough cover handling the ball in transition. Big enough to steam roll and finish with contact, but too fast for bigs/guys his size to keep up with."
13983,2020-11-03 19:07:37,jnc86q,Watch his games and tell me he‚Äôs not the fastest player on the break 90% of the time. He doesn‚Äôt slow down any with the ball in his hands either. He won‚Äôt be as big of a standout in the NBA but he‚Äôs an athlete.
13984,2020-11-03 20:34:43,jnc86q,"Oh , I forget LaMelo Ball , I thought he would be Top 3 , Thanks .  
So if Ball really drop and is available at #4 ,   
Does Bulls fans still prefer Hayes first than Ball ?„ÄÄ( If you need PG than SF )"

13986,2020-11-03 21:38:30,jnc86q,"You understand that he‚Äôs only allowed to share what his sources give him permission to share, right? He can‚Äôt share conversations that aren‚Äôt had on the record. He‚Äôs clearly outlined that he has talked to multiple sources in the league that confirmed Boston has indeed been shopping their picks but there haven‚Äôt been any teams interested in that package to move down as of yet."
13987,2020-11-03 21:22:34,jnc86q,"Nah, it's more that people overestimate the gap between draft positions. I not going to search them out now, but there have been quite a few articles about the value of trading down. The team trading down almost always comes out ahead. 

It's basically the idea of taking multiple lower probability swings instead of one."
13988,2020-11-03 23:24:34,jnc86q,"you mean Shake Milton as your best shot creator isn‚Äôt a recipe for success?

either way, they should really think about bringing in Allonzo Trier. feels like the perfect situation for him"
13989,2020-11-03 22:19:39,jnc86q,"Brown was always a project. It was known when he was drafted that he wasn‚Äôt going to flirt with starter minutes until at least year 3 at best. Unless the player is an absolute bust, you get through at least year 3 with them on their rookie deal unless you are acquiring someone better. While I wouldn‚Äôt disagree Ball may be better and that talent should take precedence over fit, Wall‚Äôs deal makes that strategy change, unfortunately. I can‚Äôt think of a worse contract in the NBA. Unless the plan is to attach multiple future firsts to Wall and take back an almost equally bad deal with less years...but even that strategy is severely flawed- tanking without picks. 

I personally think the best move for WAS is to see if GS gives you #2 and their MIN pick in 21 for Beal. By the time those guys are ready to contend, you‚Äôll be off Wall‚Äôs $."
13990,2020-11-03 19:02:13,jnc86q,Ball wont ever be able to shoot and his athleticism is average-above average how is he the highest ceiling player?
13991,2020-11-03 19:12:36,jnc86q,"yeah Okongwu obviously is a center, my wording was confusing. 

I think Altman is a fan of Sexton (as he should be), just not as a playmaker. He‚Äòll probably still go with BPA though, but in this draft that could be anybody at 5.

Tbh I‚Äòm not a big fan of the projected top picks and I also have rather casual knowledge about the prospects but my Big Board would be:

1.) Okongwu
2.) Okoro
3.) Avdija
4.) Wiseman
5.) Edwards
6.) Ball

I‚Äòm more a fan of a safer pick in this draft and Ball and Edwards scare me a little."
13992,2020-11-09 16:05:22,jnc86q,4 is wrong thats the smoke screen like micheal poter last year
13993,2020-11-03 16:43:47,jnc86q,"LMAO @ ‚Äúbest talent in the draft‚Äù - yes because look at how many volume scoring guards who can‚Äôt shoot or defend have panned out in the NBA. You think that Shepard is looking at the roster and thinking ‚Äúwow this is a sinking ship lemme grab a shitty PG prospect?‚Äù 

The Wiz were the ninth seed last year without Wall. Their mentality is to make a playoff push not tank. With Wall, Ish, and Beal taking up guard minutes, it would be absolutely idiotic to even consider drafting Lamelo, better yet trading a young wing + two picks for him üòÇ"
13994,2020-11-03 19:12:44,jnc86q,"how is; 

Troy Brown Jr(great pick btw), Wall, Beal, Bertans, Hachimura, Bryant, 6th pick, a sinking ship roster?

genuinely curious why you would think that when they more talent than quite a few teams.

Wall is going to be overpaid the rest of his contract but he‚Äôs going to be a top 15 PG."
13995,2020-11-04 00:35:59,jnc86q,Facts. He‚Äôs the one guy in this draft who i think could push the Wiz into the playoffs.
13996,2020-11-03 17:17:08,jnc86q,"Yeah , I like TBJ too , But if they don't trade , Okongwu and Okoro are gone .  
In this case , Who is left you prefer take ?"
13997,2020-11-04 04:10:18,jnc86q,I think that's a really ideal role for Hali as well. I think if any team picks him expecting him to be their full time point they are going to be disappointed.
13998,2020-11-03 21:13:21,jnc86q,"Playmaker is still a role open on the Cavs, Darius Garland moves the ball well but isn't a facilitator...a ball dominant playmaker would be able to start with Garland who came up playing offball on team USA

I believe Sexton is destined for 6th man on a good team, so that could be where this goes right or wrong"
13999,2020-11-03 19:09:10,jnc86q,"Rather have WCJ as secondary playmaker. Need primary playmaker not another secondary one. Hayes, Ball, Okoro."
14000,2020-11-03 18:59:44,jnc86q,"I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a guy that‚Äôs going to run the offense every set, but if you look at the good teams around the league, that‚Äôs becoming less of a thing. Having multiple capable ball handlers/playmakers with a spaced floor is the current ‚Äòbest‚Äô offense. Having Deni along with Coby + Lavine, along with the spacing they provide will be tough to stop. Throw Lauri and Porter in that lineup and the spacing and playmaking should push to be a top 5 unit. Admittedly, they may get torched on the other end, but I think that it would still be formidable and a net positive to close out games."
14001,2020-11-03 18:42:05,jnc86q,Thank you.
14002,2020-11-03 19:23:34,jnc86q,"Definitely agree. I know his team didn't use him as much as they could have because of Euro style of play, but he only averaged like 3 assists per 36 minutes. He seems like a guy who will usually make the smart pass, but not someone who you can give the ball and say ""make something happen off the dribble"". I prefer Hayes/Ball"
14003,2020-11-03 20:21:40,jnc86q,">but hasn‚Äôt had as much effectiveness playmaking in the half court. His handle is also mediocre

The handle is the reason for this; he's a good passer out of the post and as a 4 man can be the ball handler in pnr. Those are two skills that would really add to an offense (imagine being able to invert the offense with him on the block and Lauri outside, or coming off ball screens with Lauri).

He doesnt need to be a lead playmaker and his handling is already fine for someone with his physical profile. He just needs to marginally improve at it (mostly with his off hand) and he'll be a top tier pojnt forward. Nic Batuum was never a great ball handler but was one of the better point forwards in the game. Its one of the advantages of being so tall/big, you dont really need a great handle to just see over the defense and read the floor."
14004,2020-11-03 19:31:36,jnc86q,Deni is another Danilo Gallinari
14005,2020-11-03 20:20:51,jnc86q,You're getting downvoted but it's true. Defensive impact is very difficult to project to the NBA.
14006,2020-11-03 20:36:22,jnc86q,"I probably would, I don't know about Bulls fans in general. People seem wary of Ball's flaws, but I'd be okay taking a gamble on the upside if he's there."
14007,2020-11-12 17:58:40,jnc86q,"Despite Ball‚Äôs bad form and worse percentages, I like that he can get his shot off with ease. I have no idea how he shot from the FT line but I would guess decently.

Hayes shot very well from the FT line, and I expect his jumper to improve. It‚Äôs technically sound."
14008,2020-11-03 21:34:00,jnc86q,">It's basically the idea of taking lower probability swings instead of one.

I kind of alluded to this, ppl want more swings to get a good player. But to me if you have a good organization, competent coaching staff, and good player development, just take the guy that you think is best and get the most out of him.

I'd also be interested to see those studies on trading down, just out of curiosity. I also wonder how many of those scenarios are still staying high in the lottery vs this Celtics package. The Tatum/Fultz trade and Luka/Trae one both come to mind as valid for the team trading down because they still kept a top 5 pick (so they can still get a star) while picking up an extra asset"
14009,2020-11-03 22:09:37,jnc86q,picks in the late 20‚Äôs are rotation players every once in a while there‚Äôs a Brogdon or Kuzma but they certainly arent in every draft (and you still aren‚Äôt guaranteed to get them)
14010,2020-11-03 23:28:36,jnc86q,the pistons can‚Äôt just throw a bunch of rookies and sophomores out there and hope they get better through experience. you have to mix in vets and actual decent players so they understand what winning basketball is like
14011,2020-11-03 22:31:01,jnc86q,"Everyone is jumping on me for saying that I'd trade Troy Brown and the #9 pick for a top 3 pick and I'm not going to defend myself anymore for saying something totally reasonable. I like Troy Brown but if I could get a top 3 talent for him in most drafts, I would.

Again, my original comment said I wouldn't do it for Ball due to team fit. The players at the top for this year's draft don't fit our needs."
14012,2020-11-03 19:38:21,jnc86q,"playmaking is the best i've seen in a prospect since Ricky Rubio

if he can develop a jumper he could be dominate, esp with that size"
14013,2020-11-03 16:45:32,jnc86q,He has by far the most upside in the draft. I mean Russell Westbrook has had a decent career.
14014,2020-11-03 19:18:13,jnc86q,"I am a Wizards fan. They couldn't win 50 games with peak Wall and Beal together. Now we have a complete disaster in Wall coming back and just a short time until Beal leaves. Bertrans is a low end starter /good guy off the bench.  I'm out on Rui. I am a Gonzaga fan too, I just don't see him working out in the NBA. Bryant is a bench big because of terrible his defense is. Troy is a nice bench player. Currently there are no franchise talents on the roster that fit the timeline of the team. The wall contract destroys this team for years and they are better set up to just tank during that period."
14015,2020-11-03 20:31:03,jnc86q,"In this mock they can still get Vassell or Patrick Williams at 9 or attempt to trade down and get Nesmith, Smith or Bey. I prefer having Troy, our second and one of those guys to Lamelo."
14016,2020-11-04 06:33:19,jnc86q,"Fair point. I would agree with that, especially on a contending team.

PG of Detroit while they figure it out? Sure but to your point they would need a more dynamic creator long term."
14017,2020-11-03 23:44:45,jnc86q,"I see what you're saying but these cats have egos. Depends on the guy but it could be a disservice to the locker room/culture...

The Cavs just need to focus on drafting a wing imo."
14018,2020-11-03 19:18:04,jnc86q,"I like Okoro as a prospect, but he is no where close to a primary playmaker. He doesn‚Äôt project to even be a secondary. Not sure what you‚Äôre seeing that gives you that outlook. I‚Äôm not high on Hayes for numerous reasons. I‚Äôd probably take Ball over Deni if he was available (he won‚Äôt be). WCJ is not a secondary playmaker and he needs to stay healthy before he‚Äôs factored in to any Bulls plans."

And what upside are you referring to? Lamelo has good court vision and great size and that‚Äôs literally it. He can‚Äôt shoot or defend which are two of the most important qualities for today‚Äôs NBA. This dude has bust written all over him.

14026,2020-11-04 07:59:07,jnc86q,You need to be good to have an ego worth keeping. The Sixers drafted 3 Centers in a row with top 5 picks but one of them was Embiid so who really cares. If Cleveland thinks LaMelo is the BPA they should take him.
14027,2020-11-03 20:01:30,jnc86q,"You‚Äôre misunderstanding me. I‚Äôm not saying Okoro would be. I‚Äôm saying I‚Äôd rather have Okoro over Deni and rely on WCJ as my secondary playmaker. He is most definitely a secondary playmaker. 

Again for me it‚Äôs Ball, Hayes, Okoro. I have them all even for different reasons and will be happy with any of them."
14028,2020-11-03 21:06:46,jnc86q,">Gobert go out of the lottery

Because coming into the draft he was incredibly raw with next to no offensive upside. His appeal was entirely based on his size and length, and at the time he was incredibly skinny and desperately needed to put on weight, which isn't always easy for guys that size. Okafor was already extremely polished offensively and ready to score in the NBA day 1."

you add in 3 1st rounders and now you‚Äôre looking at 7 of the 8 rotation players being super young. that team is awful and will learn bad habits"
14030,2020-11-04 14:58:16,jnc86q,He did? Where?
14031,2020-11-03 17:02:31,jnc86q,"He also has a generational skill- passing. He definitely could bust for sure, but he has a far higher ceiling than any other player in this draft."
14032,2020-11-03 16:57:41,jnc86q,You mentioned volume point guards who can't shoot or defend and Russell Westbrook fits that bill. I don't think that is applicable to Lonzo. I really don't think he will be a bad fender during his career and his shooting will be fine. The concern more is with shot selection.
14033,2020-11-03 20:27:20,jnc86q,"Got it. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen enough from WCJ to think he‚Äôs a secondary playmaker. I like the idea of him being one and operating the offense from the high post. If he can show that (and stay healthy), I think Lauri is the odd man out in closing time and probably on the block at the deadline. That said, I wouldn‚Äôt let me draft decision be impacted by the prospect of WCJ becoming that."
14034,2020-11-04 05:05:45,jnc86q,"Eight players is a really tiny rotation. Most teams run 9 or even 10. If 7 young players *earn* rotation spots, that doesn't seem like an issue. If 1-2 don't in year one, that's okay too."
14035,2020-11-03 17:09:28,jnc86q,One good quality is not enough to balance out all his flaws. Okongwu has a much higher ceiling and is my favorite to be the star of this draft.
14036,2020-11-03 17:01:01,jnc86q,Westbrook is a much better defender than Lamelo. Westbrook is also one of the most athletic basketball players to ever play the game. Lamelo has neither the defensive aptitude  nor the athleticism that Westbrook possesses. This comparison is a terrible one.
14037,2020-11-03 20:48:36,jnc86q,"I think the FO should bring in Noah to reunite him with Donovan and let him mentor WCJ.

I believe WCJ has shown the propensity to run the offense from the high post like Noah. 

I think Lauri or Zach will find their way outta town. They‚Äôre the 2 that are closest to needing to get paid. 

I want to FO to chase potential in this draft as I think well either be at the end of the lottery or a 7/8th seed going forward. Swing while we have the chance. 

The 4 prospects I see that have the most potential are Edwards, Ball, Hayes and Okoro. 

I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll have a shot at Edwards. 

I believe Ball and Hayes are the primary playmakers the FO should target and if they‚Äôre afraid of a bust then go with Hayes.

Okoro has the potential to be a Butler-esque wing."
14038,2020-11-03 17:04:00,jnc86q,Westbrook has consistently been one of the worst PH defenders in the league. I actually would say Lamelo has better defensive instincts than Westbrook.
14039,2020-11-03 22:12:55,jnc86q,"I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre too far off. You‚Äôre higher on Hayes than I am and maybe a bit more optimistic on Okoro‚Äôs playmaking ability. I see some Butler in Okoro, but I also think his floor is MKG-ish if the shot doesn‚Äôt come around. I would rather build a team with players who don‚Äôt have any huge negatives that force you to take them off the court (with lottery picks and 8 figure contracts anyway). Okoro worries me a bit in that regard. That said, everything you read about him commends his work ethic, so I have faith he‚Äôll get better. I would have Wiseman up there as I don‚Äôt think WCJ stops me from drafting the best player, to your point of getting the best prospect."
14040,2020-11-03 17:08:20,jnc86q,Westbrook also had a DBPM of 4.7 a few years ago. He is most definitely not one of the worst defenders in the league. Guys like Trae Young and Rui are the worst defenders in the league. Lamelo could not even keep up with the NBL defensively. He is going to get destroyed on defense in the NBA.
14041,2020-11-03 22:15:59,jnc86q,"I don‚Äôt think Wiseman is anything more than Whiteside so I‚Äôd stay for away from him. If they want a big then target Okongwu, more of a fit in the modern game and more upside IMO.

I think they need to take a risk on a player with some negatives and bank on Donovan and Co. to work that negative out."
14042,2020-11-03 17:26:54,jnc86q,"Westbrook is terrible defensively, especially given his tools. Lamelo projects as an incredible passer, good defender, and elite pick and roll player. His only questionable is a large one, shooting. It will make or break his career."
14043,2020-11-03 12:50:00,jn9eur,Okoro at 18 huh?  Interesting
14044,2020-11-03 13:44:27,jn9eur,"Just commenting on the Knicks stuff.

Knicks are interested in Kira but are in love with Okoro. I think in this scenario Okoro doesn't pass us.

As for pick 27, we don't take McDaniels. We already have someone who's in the similar boat as McDaniels with Knox, and tbh as bad as Knox has been he's a better prospect than McDaniels imo.

Assuming Kira is taken, Isaiah Joe, Tyler Bey, or Jordan Nwora would be better off fit alone.

Assuming we take Okoro like I mentioned, Theo has to be in consideration for the pick"
14045,2020-11-03 14:38:29,jn9eur,Asinine. The Bulls won‚Äôt pass on Ball.
14046,2020-11-03 14:17:44,jn9eur, I way the Celtics take three guys they have to roster this year. At least one international stash in the first round for them.
14047,2020-11-03 14:39:14,jn9eur,I'm sure that pick 6 is going to be Deni Avdija.  I think you got it right.  The mock seems correct to me.  Thank you.
14048,2020-11-04 03:22:36,jn9eur,">Pick 9 -

I disagree heavy on this"
14049,2020-11-03 15:18:31,jn9eur,"From what I‚Äôve seen from other analysts, one of Hayes‚Äô biggest weaknesses is a non-existent right hand. How does that factor into your analysis?"
14050,2020-11-03 15:51:11,jn9eur,Obi Toppin slips to 11?   Bold prediction my dude
14051,2020-11-04 03:23:54,jn9eur,"> The Cavaliers would be ecstatic to have LaMelo Ball fall to them on draft night. 

I think Ball or Wiseman are #1 on our board, Koby Altman has shown he will draft the highest ceiling (unless there is a medical issue)"
14052,2020-11-09 06:47:29,jn9eur,"Okoro 18 & T.Bey 17, nert!!!!"
14053,2020-11-03 13:58:27,jn9eur,"I wonder about fit especially at the top. Last thing Charlotte needs is another guard unless the make a move. I could see them making a move to get Okongwu and maybe trading with Detroit and picking up another asset. I feel them and The Wiz have been linked to bigs so I could see either one of them making a move to get Okongwu. 
I think Toppin might be too tempting for Jordan as he loves guys who succeed in college to his detriment. 
I also think the Bulls or Cavs jump at Deni. He fits a need although I could see the Bulls stretching a bit for Haliburton as he can fit with other guys who need the ball in their hands and still be a playmaker when needed. 
I know the Cavs will take best available but 3 straight PGs in the lottery does not bode well long term and if LaMelo really falls that far I wonder if he might slip to Detroit."
14054,2020-11-03 17:00:00,jn9eur,Just saying wiseman most likely won‚Äôt go top 10. Players with controversy around them usually go later in the draft or undrafted. Deni is most likely going 2nd to the GSW considering how much they‚Äôve praised him. Most likely they‚Äôll trade Wiggins and possibly next years T-wolves pick for a center.
14055,2020-11-03 12:58:17,jn9eur,If this was a big board I would have him much higher. But I think that there is a chance he falls on draft night in a similar way Nassir Little fell in the 2019 draft. Entirely based on the lack of interest in wings who can't shoot in the modern NBA. I love his defense though.
14056,2020-11-03 14:42:16,jn9eur,"I came here to say this as well. I don't think the Knicks consider Kira Lewis unless they trade back, especially with Okoro available. I know a lot of people are surprised considering no one on the current Knicks roster is capable of shooting the basketball, and Okoro doesn't help with that either. However, Okoro has the build and playstyle that Thibs loves, and reports have already come out about him being popular among the coaching staff. The Knicks are likely going to try and roll out Frank/RJ/Okoro/Robinson so no one will be scoring buckets, but they will be playing solid defense. The one benefit of a guy like Okoro is that his body looks NBA ready but still has room for tremendous growth. 

The FO is doing their due diligence this time around it seems, and seems to have put the media on a major information diet. A lot of what you see involving the Knicks is speculation once you dig into the articles. As a Knicks fan, I would be happy with Hayes/Okoro/Haliburton in the case that guys like Toppin/Okongwu get drafted head of us and one of those guys drops.  

The other thing is that if Theo Maledon is there at 27, which I don't think he will be, there's a good chance the Knicks look to pick him up."
14057,2020-11-03 14:29:39,jn9eur,"Okoro, Tyler Bey, and Mitchell Robinson would be one of the best defensive teams to watch out for. Offensively it could get really bad tho."
14058,2020-11-03 21:46:10,jn9eur,"A lineup with RJ Barrett, Isaac Okoro and Mitchell Robinson would seriously struggle with floorspacing. While I do think Barrett can become a good shooter, I think he is still a long way away. 

As someone who follows the Timberwolves, I know how stubborn Thibodeau can be. I get that he is not the president of basketball operations this time, but he will still have a lot of say in the team's decisions. Thibs and the front office have already taken Lewis out to dinner for a meeting, which to me is a sign that he is their guy. Reports around the league also indicate that Kira Lewis is in play for the Pistons at 7. 

With the 27th pick I think they have quite a few good options. Nwora and Joe could both be great picks, and if Bey is available he would also be great. I selected McDaniels based on his upside and trade value, but if they have a player they like more, they should by all means take them."
14059,2020-11-03 21:57:04,jn9eur,"I don't think they would, but I think they should. While Ball's passing would give them a boost, I believe that they would be terrible defensively trying to run Ball, White and LaVine at the same time. 

Chad Ford recently wrote that he has heard Tyrese Haliburton has been moving up almost all teams draft boards. He is an extremely efficient point guard, who shot 50/42/82. He doesn't need to be ball dominant to be a good playmaker either as he averaged 6.5 assist with only a 22.4% usage rate. Next to two other ballhandlers in White and LaVine, Haliburton is very good off of the ball. Whereas LaMelo does not play well off the ball at all. Billy Donovan likes 3+D players which would make Haliburton a great fit. 

However, I don't know if the Bulls front office would be able to pass on LaMelo Ball's ceiling."
14060,2020-11-03 14:39:31,jn9eur,They will
14061,2020-11-03 21:47:57,jn9eur,I seriously considered drafting them Leandro Bolmaro as a stash player. I also believe there is a high chance they try to trade up with all of their picks.
14062,2020-11-03 21:59:40,jn9eur,Thank you. I truly believe that is the place he can reach his potential to the fullest.
14063,2020-11-03 22:04:44,jn9eur,"For a 19 year old, I am not overly concerned. From what I have seen Hayes isn't actually that bad with his right hand, he is just not very confident or comfortable using it. I believe that with the right coaching and training, this problem should hopefully disappear over the next 2-3 years."
14064,2020-11-03 22:11:26,jn9eur,"Bold predictions are always fun though, aren't they?

I think he will be strongly considered by Charlotte at 3, Cleveland at 5, Detroit at 7, New York at 8 and Phoenix at 10. In my mock draft I had him slip because I believe that these teams have other players who either are better fits, or they are more interested in. 

His defense and free throw shooting may scare teams off. A team like the Spurs could hopefully get the most out of his potential."
14065,2020-11-04 07:07:32,jn9eur,I would be hard af if we got Ball @ 5 and I don‚Äôt even like him. The value is bonkers tho. Kid is easily the #1 ceiling in this class. I want Okoro but  damn it‚Äôd be fun to watch LaMelo.
14066,2020-11-03 21:32:03,jn9eur,"I personally don't think Wiseman falls out of the top 10. I am very cautious of the fact he only played 3 games in college though. I believe that his stock will be based on his workouts. If he can prove he can shoot in his workouts, he could easily go in the top 3. The ballhandling he has shown in his workouts could also be used to create dribble handoff playmaking, similar to how Adebayo is run in Miami. Golden State would love a rim protector who can shoot. And Charlotte have reportedly looked into trading up for him."
14067,2020-11-04 07:05:00,jn9eur,Okoro is a much different player than Little. He isn‚Äôt a terrific shooter but he trended upwards in the second half of the season from three and is arguably the best wing finisher at the rim in the class and passes very efficiently for a ‚Äúdefensive specialist‚Äù.  IMO the only similarities to Little are their freakish builds and vertical athleticism.
14068,2020-11-03 14:39:22,jn9eur,Well I doubt we go Tyler Bey if we grab Okoro. We'd probably go Isaiah Joe or someone like that
14069,2020-11-03 22:07:46,jn9eur,"I'm not worried about the spacing issues of Okoro, RJ, and Mitch. We're a team that should take the best available talent and worry about fit later"
14070,2020-11-03 22:13:15,jn9eur,The Bulls need to take a risk -and try to get a superstar not a fucking guy like Haliburton.
14071,2020-11-04 00:09:05,jn9eur,">  Next to two other ballhandlers in White and LaVine, Haliburton is very good off of the ball. Whereas LaMelo does not play well off the ball at all.

I get your logic but to me the difference between Lamelos talent and Haliburton means I wouldn't worry about the fit with White and Lavine. The bulls arent winning anything with them so I wouldn't worry about picking a player who fits with them. 

Personally I am high on Lavine but I don't see a path forward with him in Chicago. I would be looking to see what I could get for him. Lavine is a ceiling raiser to me and not a floor raiser so I would imagine he would work better in a playoff team."
14072,2020-11-03 15:24:13,jn9eur,Why?
14073,2020-11-04 07:21:38,jn9eur,"Oh I agree. I don't think they are similar players though, I believe that the fear of drafting a non-shooting wing may lead to him falling. I think that Okoro could be a really good player in the right situation. He could be a good fit for Cleveland, Atlanta and San Antonio. If none of these teams take him, which in my mock none did, I can see him falling just outside of the lottery."
14074,2020-11-03 22:25:48,jn9eur,I wouldn't sleep on Haliburton. I think he is going to be one of the best players in the draft. But I get your logic. Ball's potential is through the roof.
14075,2020-11-03 19:29:44,jn9eur,Why would they pick him? He can't shoot or defend. There's also questions about his attitude and personality from the interviews. Why would they pick him when there's players like Hayes without as many flaws. People see a guy with flashy passes and run with the hype.
14076,2020-11-03 19:58:08,jn9eur,I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre not the GM. I love Hayes and I‚Äôd be happy with him but I‚Äôm not gunna get my panties in a bunch if we take Ball.

For example, against fierce rivals and top euro-league club, and after the starting PG was fouled out, in OT - he took charge and let Hapoel to victory ([https://youtu.be/np1ukLXirCw](https://youtu.be/np1ukLXirCw)

14116,2020-11-02 15:25:42,jmminr,This is the worst draft since 2013 and possibly even 2000.  I'm sure a couple good players will come out of it but it likely won't be the ones at the top.  Wiseman is clearly the best prospect but his playstyle doesn't fit the modern NBA well enough to justify a top 3 pick if the draft was stronger.  Edwards and Ball have massive glaring flaws in their games.  I don't even anyone picking in the top 5.
14117,2020-11-02 16:32:39,jmminr,"That would be a terrible draft for the Magic. 
 
 
 
A 6'3"" SG that has no positives. Can't play PG at all. Has reputation as a shooter which he disproved in his one year of facing competition. Basically ""he was thought to be a shooter in high school"" FIRST ROUND PICK!!! 
 
Smallish, decent, but boring 2nd. Probably won't see the floor. 
 
Might as well say Orlando abstains from the 2020 draft."

14138,2020-11-02 16:10:42,jmminr,"My opinions and draft assumptions 

James wiseman shouldn‚Äôt be a top 10 pick.
Deni Avdija will go second.
Killian Hayes is the best player in draft and will win ROY and it won‚Äôt be close.
Sadiq Bey and Tyler Bey will be lottery picks. 
Cole Anthony will drops to late 20‚Äôs early second round. LaMelo Ball is already a top 10 passer in the NBA. Anthony Edwards is a solid scoring option but will never be an all star. Okoro, Okongu, Toppin are busts. Wiseman will be a serviceable big but ultimately a letdown. A large portion of draft will be successful role players with long careers. Will not go down as a weak draft but just one devoid of stars"
14139,2020-11-02 13:49:34,jmminr,"The middle of the draft is absolutely stacked. There's lacking star power up top but it's filled with very good role players imo.

14140,2020-11-03 00:27:06,jmminr,"that‚Äôs 100% right. It‚Äôs not a bad draft at all, it‚Äôs just lacking like two star-level prospects at the top. The late pick guys are really solid looking, there‚Äôs a ton of value to be had even into the 2nd round."
14141,2020-11-03 01:10:46,jmminr,"I think that has more to do with covid and the lack of typical player evaluation methods.

Normally, by the time the draft rolls around these guys have played a lot more games, they've been poked and prodded and run through workouts. And a general consensus emerges. But the lack of good data leads to wildly different evaluations."

14154,2020-11-02 14:00:08,jmminr,"Potential. He has a great frame, great wingspan, has potential to be a really really good defensive player. Shot well from the FT line which a lot of people use as a predictor in the ability to shoot 3s in the NBA. It's all about upside. Nwora has showed he can be a solid shooter but he's not very quick"
14155,2020-11-02 15:11:59,jmminr,Nwora knew this past season was a chance to add value to his stock.  He didn't seem to do that at all.
14156,2020-11-02 21:04:36,jmminr,"For Nwora - I think some teams might be inclined to take him higher than that but the concern with him is everything he does outside of shooting. He's strong, but not a very good athlete in terms of foot speed or leaping, which will harm him defensively if he plays as a small 4 and really harm him if he plays the 3. Little of his offense beyond shooting seems likely to translate - not going to break people down off the dribble or likely play-make beyond ""obvious"" passes. Has shown little in terms of either ball handling on the PnR or being an effective roll guy - maybe just pick and pop. The catch and shoot is a calling card, but hasn't been able to hit a ton off the dribble. To stick he's going to have to really kill catch and shoot looks, which he's done super well in college, but his mechanics look worse than someone like Duncan Robinson - his release point is lower and his shot is slower overall. I don't think the floater game / transition will be as available to him in the pros given the athletic step up. Defensively, actually a pretty good team defender and should be able to switch a PnR, but you'd worry about putting him on 3s and below who can challenge him off the dribble - more than anything offensively I think that will be his ""swing factor."""

He‚Äôs a pretty good shooter off the catch(~38%), so the idea is hopefully with good coaching he can fix his shot selection and become much more efficient. 

Everyone in this draft has flaws, you can‚Äôt look for a perfect prospect. Edwards, the projected #1 pick, is extremely raw. He‚Äôs a great athlete but I could 100% see him bust. LaMelo has his flaws but they seem fixable (poor defensive effort and bad shot selection) with good coaching."

Bugging. His defense is great and half court shot creation is pretty good. His playmaking needs work but that's his biggest flaw. Every scout buys his shot. He shot 83% from the FT line and fixed a big issue over the summer with his shot which is his arc. Getting Maxey at 15 is a huge W. He's very similar to Jrue Holiday.

Almost all the kids that generally would be poor shooters are having decent turnarounds, with fixed shooting forms that are quicker, improved ball handling, improved physique at a time when they're still growing, etc. 99% of them are also healthy now.

Its a good time to fix your foundation with the help of a dedicated trainer. Better to do it now than in 3 years. Almost all the kids in this draft also have functional 3pt range, unlike former vets who had to add it to their game in their mid 20's."

Tyler Bey at 27 works for the defense he brings. If he can develop the 3, he can be in the Jerami Grant mold. Would be valuable.

Isaiah Joe would be good at 27 for his shooting while Ramsey good for his shot creation.

Jones is a much better floor general and more well rounded compared to Riller.

14209,2020-11-02 15:13:41,jmminr,"haha it is pretty bleak, yeah. Maybe I'd say it's not a bad pick from 9 onwards, but there are a lot of guys I'd take a punt on if only cos the upside's higher, even though the chances are really slim any of them actually pan out"
14210,2020-11-02 22:27:05,jmminr,"Yeah, it's the problem with leaving the drafting to a general audience. They're not going to be super informed of our longterm situation.

General fans just say:

* ""Boston needs a big""
* ""Boston needs to stash""
* etc.

When you ask r/bostonceltics who should be taken #14, it's all guards and wings. 



From our [recent poll:](https://np.reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/jltlv3/reddit_community_mock_draft_with_the_14_pick_the/)

1. Tyrell Terry - Wasn't on OP's polling choices

14211,2020-11-02 19:02:30,jmminr,Yeah kat might be too big for that
14212,2020-11-02 19:02:12,jmminr,Good point
14213,2020-11-02 18:44:41,jmminr,"Everytime I watch him all I think is ""mario hezonja"" and if I'm chicago I want a guy like okoro."
14214,2020-11-02 15:48:55,jmminr,"Can't shoot. There's quite a bit to like, but the lack of shooting is a MAJOR red flag for a 3/4. If you could guarantee me that he would be a 38-42% three point shooter on good volume, then yeah, I'd be all over it."
14215,2020-11-02 12:36:27,jmminr,"That FT is misleading he was only shooting 2 a game, but I get your point"
14216,2020-11-02 12:35:01,jmminr,If Detroit or NY takes him he's a PG
14217,2020-11-02 16:51:21,jmminr,"Really? Take a look at every star 5 in today‚Äôs game. They shoot, they pass, they switch on defence. Wiseman is similar to players like javale McGee or best case scenario players like Dwight Howard or DeAndre Jordan. These are the types of players who are getting benched more often in place of all around players like Bam and Anthony Davis. Then add the fact he had a shit attitude and barely gave a fuck in college. Then add the giant list of busts with almost the exact same description as him. I‚Äôm shocked so many mock drafts have him so high.

I even just looked at other opinions with most drafts listing his most common comparison as Hassan Whiteside. If Charlotte doesn‚Äôt take him 3rd then I see him dropping past 10"
14218,2020-11-02 17:33:20,jmminr,Or both could end up being busts and washing out in 2 years
14219,2020-11-02 18:31:45,jmminr,"both are decent players but I think stars is a reach, especially for Quickley"
14220,2020-11-02 22:07:05,jmminr,I thought Knight was the better prospect over Kemba so it goes to show I know nothing about potential and upside lol
14221,2020-11-03 00:04:52,jmminr,">the first player fully developed in Canada to get drafted

I didn't know this. This is something to be proud of! I hope he develops and works out well for us. Plus the added guard depth like you mentioned"
14222,2020-11-02 15:16:52,jmminr,"Honestly other than drafting LaMelo, I think Barrett is best suited as your pseudo point gaurd driving and kicking. Get him more versatile wings to spread the floor"
14223,2020-11-02 15:18:31,jmminr,Isn't that kind of like trading for Dennis Smith when you already have Nkitilina? Seems accurate even if it doesn't make any sense.
14224,2020-11-02 15:24:35,jmminr,Since he‚Äôs the bpa by far and I think he‚Äôs better then Grant Riller
14225,2020-11-02 15:35:53,jmminr,"He has value no doubt and he deserved this award in a rather weak NCAA season. But he also lost against the players you mentioned in the years before, it's not like he was a freshman last year. Let's face it he is a 22 year old, three almost four years older than some of the other prospects, that's gonna weigh against him."
14226,2020-11-02 15:14:41,jmminr,"The interviewing is a key piece, because I can't get over the Anthony Bennett comparisons"
14227,2020-11-02 16:00:30,jmminr,Toppin reminds me of Thomas Robinson/Derrick Williams
14228,2020-11-02 21:37:25,jmminr,"He's definitely one of the most NBA ready guys on offense. He is just so bad on defense, he really can't guard a pick and roll for his life. At his position it's a lot harder to hide that flaw on defense"
14229,2020-11-02 14:37:32,jmminr,One of his big player comps is Kawhi lol
14230,2020-11-02 15:25:30,jmminr,"He might be NBA ready, you're right.  But I could fill a bus with guys with his measurables that all have ""potential"". 

If I remember correctly, didn't he disappear against some of the better teams they played?  Seems like he padded a lot of his numbers against lower level competition.  Did he get off the bus vs UK and Duke?  I don't remember all the games so maybe he had a big game vs someone else good but I sort of remember those two games as ones he was seemingly absent."
14231,2020-11-02 15:27:09,jmminr,He has potential but he also doesn't make sense fit wise for Charlotte next to Devonte and Rozier. I also get that maybe they're not in position to draft based on fit but I'm not sure Ball is good enough to override fit concerns
14232,2020-11-02 14:07:14,jmminr,"Oh yeah for sure. I just think he has some big gaps in shooting and defense. Physically he definitely has the tools and is clearly skilled. The issue is will he commit on defense and create efficient offense. I‚Äôve watched an hour or so worth of him in Australia and the dude takes some head scratcher shots. Hopefully we can see him get taken in by a good development team. Also as an outside fan, it would be fun seeing him just run the hornets offense"
14233,2020-11-02 14:27:33,jmminr,because people still have a hate boner for Lavar. people love anthony edwards who imo is just as flawed as melo.
14234,2020-11-02 16:52:29,jmminr,"Has talent, but at best he is Ben Simmons without no defense. That my friend is a scary thought if he can't fix his shot."
14235,2020-11-02 14:24:35,jmminr,"reddit herd mentality. 

People said he has weakness as if every player in every draft doesn't. Like is he suppose to be the greatest player of all time before he's even in the league.   
Deandre Ayton had just as many weakness but you don't see nearly as much hate.

Lamelo's ""weakness"" is he shoots 28% from 3 on difficulty shot selection (which clearly means he will be 35% plus in his prime) 

and his defense  (even though he average 1.5 steals and is 6 foot 7 so a promise he will be a better defender than Steph, Lillard, Kyrie, Booker, Trae,  Lavine ect.

If Trae Young was 6 foot 7 and shot 10% worse from 3 is that not the number 1 pick?"
14236,2020-11-02 17:31:32,jmminr,You think there‚Äôs a chance New York would trade up to 3 if Ball is there? Maybe something like 8 and Mitch for 3?
14237,2020-11-02 16:48:58,jmminr,You poor tormented soul.
14238,2020-11-02 15:07:06,jmminr,Nobody in this draft is 'reasonably' going to be an all star.  Thats why its such a crapshoot
14239,2020-11-02 16:06:24,jmminr,"Disagree, he's probably not falling past 5. He's more of jack of all trades (except for maybe free-throws) and master of none. He is one of the best playmakers in the draft though, and I personally think he's a high floor mediocre ceiling type of player.  If there are people who put Ball at #1 when Deni is more athletic, can defend, and rebound better, then Deni certainly is a high lottery pick in this draft. Maybe he falls past 9 in stronger drafts such as 2021, but he's right up there among the top 5 this year."
14240,2020-11-02 16:00:08,jmminr,"I bet most of those guys are guards though, which shows the value of a wing. You can pick up a solid guard late in the first this year but wings are still so valuable

Plus avdija played very well since the lockdown restart, something that college players haven‚Äôt been able to do"
14241,2020-11-02 18:53:34,jmminr,He's far from Mario. He's more like Lamar Odom or Andre Iggy (not as athletic as Iggy but he's still an athletic player)
14242,2020-11-02 16:30:09,jmminr,"Not to make the comparison but he‚Äôs shooting as well as Luka is from 3 with a similar skill set. Luka lite would be a steal In this draft

Not to mention his ability to switch defensively which is massive with the way nba is played now. I still think warriors pick him second if they don‚Äôt trade pick tho so don‚Äôt worry"
14243,2020-11-02 12:38:51,jmminr,"I just feel he could play off ball effectively, his bail handling doesn‚Äôt seem good enough in my eyes to picture him as a primary playmaker full time, I feel like playing off of trae would be beneficial"
14244,2020-11-02 12:37:07,jmminr,No team is taking him as their primary ball handler.
14245,2020-11-02 17:00:45,jmminr,"Thats fair, I agree hes got a limited skillset. I think with his age and his frame hes worth at least a top 10 pick especially in a weaker draft. Skills can be developed"
14246,2020-11-02 18:36:25,jmminr,Their potential to be star players is a lot higher than other guys in the 2nd imo. Will either of them become stars? Personally i don‚Äôt think so. I like Stanley a lot but see him being a really good 3rd/4th guy. Look at what Gilbert arenas said about Stanley. Quickley will likely end up in Europe but the fact that two guys with their potential are available among many other names in the 40-50 range is crazy. This draft is crazy deep with guys who could shock you.
14247,2020-11-02 22:09:29,jmminr,Well killian is a consensus top 2 point guard in this draft (potentially number over lamelo depending on how you see it) so im very happy that lamelo is valued so highly because it leads to killian dropping right into our hands
14248,2020-11-02 15:23:35,jmminr,RJ has good passing and playmaking for a wing. But i to watch him for one more season before i can say he can be a primary playmaker. Right now i can def see him as a secondary
14249,2020-11-02 15:22:47,jmminr,"No because Frank was our only young PG on the team before DSJ came, everyone else was an expiring. So getting a second PG on a rookie scale contract is fine because you can distribute the minutes between them both. 

With this mock we have 4 PG's. How are we distributing those minutes?"
14250,2020-11-02 15:28:26,jmminr,I don't agree that he's BPA tbh.
14251,2020-11-02 17:35:57,jmminr,"At the same time though, Lillard was an older rookie but that didn't hold him back. Or on a much smaller scale, Brogdon. Just depends on the player and how hard they are willing to work"
14252,2020-11-02 23:26:16,jmminr,"Obi is a better athlete and a better shooter, I actually think he's the safest pick in this draft. Dude is just good at basketball."
14253,2020-11-03 06:21:47,jmminr,I don‚Äôt think they are similar players at all.
14254,2020-11-02 18:59:32,jmminr,Devonte Graham and Terry Rozier are definitely not players you make drafting choices based on.
14255,2020-11-02 16:19:04,jmminr,"Rozier is only there for a good time, not a long one."
14256,2020-11-02 20:11:17,jmminr,"who tf cares about fit in Charlotte?? that team aint making any runs in the next 5 years, their will be a lot of turnover before that team becomes good"
14257,2020-11-02 16:57:01,jmminr,If you pick Ball at 3 the other two become pretty disposable.
14258,2020-11-02 18:05:45,jmminr,"There is never any excuse to not take the best available player. Take him, then trade him for a better fit *plus* something else."
14259,2020-11-02 20:17:13,jmminr,"Charlotte needs talent right now not fit, lol."
14260,2020-11-02 15:08:16,jmminr,Agreed. I think Anthony Edwards floor is so low. I can see him a complete bust and out of the league in 3 years. I just don't see that for Ball. I think (at worst) he'll be a good rotation player the next 10 years.
14261,2020-11-02 17:50:57,jmminr,he can shoot. ben simmons could never shoot.
14262,2020-11-02 17:58:01,jmminr,"He's a much better passer than Simmons. And he can operate the half court offense decently unlike Simmons cause he's atleast willing to shoot whether off screens or if you give him space.

You pray to god the kid has atleast tried to fix his shooting form (like all the other prospects working with trainers) and draft him expecting a future HoF nut job brat with a crazy father.....what am I saying, he's a powderkeg of a prospect, its all fucked."

14265,2020-11-02 20:09:10,jmminr,You'll take 8 and Beyblade and you'll like it.
14266,2020-11-02 18:57:57,jmminr,I dunno it's hard to gauge how good he'll be but I just don't think he has enough of a sample size to prove he'll translate to the NBA. He's not a 7'3 unicorn like porizingis and he's not a guy with a resume like luka prior to getting drafted.
14267,2020-11-02 18:46:12,jmminr,"He will never be a luka-lite. Deni played off the bench and luka was an MVP and champion by 18. Every euro prospect who was taken as a bench player has turned into a bust, not even joking there's a full list of them including guys like hezonja and darko."
14268,2020-11-02 20:25:28,jmminr,Luka shot a lot better from the free throw line (an indicator of ability to improve shooting). Luka was also an infinitely better passer. In now way is Avdija comparable to Luka.
14269,2020-11-02 12:48:59,jmminr,If NY or Detroit takes him you don't think he'll be a Point Guard?
14270,2020-11-02 12:41:50,jmminr,"Knicks will definitely use him as their primary ball handler maybe not day 1, but before the end of his rookie campaign. Same for the Pistons neither team is set at PG enough not to especially Detroit"
14271,2020-11-02 22:14:26,jmminr,">Well killian is a consensus top 2 point guard in this draft

I mean that doesn't hold a lot of weight in this comment thread considering Knight was also a consensus top 2 point guard :/

But still, I hope he works out"
14272,2020-11-02 16:09:04,jmminr,"Reminds me of Winslow in Miami before they got Jimmy Butler. If RJ cant spread the floor as a shooter, then the ball should be in his hands. Winslow played his best basketball ever as a left 6'6"" PG who cant really shoot but can drive"
14273,2020-11-02 15:33:38,jmminr,It's also a bit hard to judge since he doesn't have any shooters to pass to.
14274,2020-11-02 23:27:49,jmminr,"Why the fuck would the Knicks take another short, bad shooter if Nwora, the 2nd best shooter in the draft is still available."
14275,2020-11-02 17:51:21,jmminr,"I think people take more chances or  don't care as much in last few years, for example Heat take Duncan Robinson etc.
I honestly think we will see more ""older"" people getting picked for one reason or another as the time goes by.
I was reading a blog or post last week where the average ""free agent/lottery pick "" that was over 21 or 21+ had more value/did better then the young ones."
14276,2020-11-02 20:15:17,jmminr,"Also: why is it such a tremendously bad fit, anyway? Rozier can and has played off-ball a lot in his career, and Graham hit 42% of catch-and-shoot threes last year. Having two playmakers on the court can also be... good?

It might not be what you'd put together from scratch but it wouldn't be, like, incoherent."
14277,2020-11-02 18:01:13,jmminr,"Fr who cares about Rozier, that‚Äôs trade piece #2"
14278,2020-11-02 16:00:41,jmminr,"Er kind of disagree. Edwards at least has insane athleticism to compensate for his flaws. If everything goes wrong for the two, Ball will  be a 3rd stringer pg due to fact that he can't shoot and defend at the NBA level. Edwards on the hand could be a back-up sg. It's blatantly clear that Ball has the lowest floor and one of the highest ceilings in the draft."
14279,2020-11-02 22:11:41,jmminr,Worst case scenario Lamelo is just Michael Carter Williams skill level with Ball family attitude and baggage. Thats out of the league in 3 years talk to me
14280,2020-11-02 18:26:06,jmminr,Can he? His pro career so far certainly doesn't show it.
14281,2020-11-02 19:08:44,jmminr,He‚Äôs a much better passer than one of the best passers in the league?
14282,2020-11-02 19:21:55,jmminr,"> He's a much better passer than Simmons.

Um what? Ben simmons has ranked top 10 twice and top 20 once in his 3 years in the NBA in assist percentage. Averages for his career 8 apg. He is conservatively one of the best 20 passes in the NBA. To say that a rookie playing in Australia is a better passer than him is ludicrous."
14283,2020-11-02 15:05:38,jmminr,The NBL is a tier above the NCAA. They're all pros afterall and most of them played in the NCAA too. And I think they got some former NBA guys playing over there as well. So Lamelo played in a much tougher league than Ayton did.
14284,2020-11-02 14:54:16,jmminr,"28% from 3 including his 1 preseason game according to realgm
28% making shots like this 
https://youtu.be/xNMvIZFLuRQ?t=67
is different than MKG being left open shooting the same percentage.
 Luka and Draymond shoot the same percentage from 3 for their career. 
But who's the better shooter?

Ayton averaged more turnovers than assist and wasn't a great defender in college either. But no one considered him to have ""major weakness""

College basketball is a much weaker league than Australia it's not even close. The worst team in Australia was the Lamelos's team and they had a top 5 pick and 3 former NBA Players. Every team in Australia would be ranked in the top 25 of college basketball.
Lamelo's shooting splits were low because he had to take so many bad shot carrying his bad team."
14285,2020-11-02 16:05:27,jmminr,I think he could function in that role for a little while but it wouldn‚Äôt be his strong suit necessarily. Needs to build up his pick and roll skills and ball handling before he can be a full time one. I think he‚Äôll be more effective playing off the ball at least at the beginning of his career
14286,2020-11-02 12:52:57,jmminr,Knicks want a shot creator at the 1. They said this months ago. Haliburton is not that
14287,2020-11-02 13:41:14,jmminr,"Haliburton seems like a great secondary playmaker guy to put next to Trae Young. Either him or Killian Hayes can be that offball guy. My guess on why Haliburton projects higher is because Hayes has a sub-30 three point percentage? 

I think the projected landing spots for Haliburton and Hayes are valid. If New York can't grab either then I expect them to throw a ton of money at FVV. Assuming Vassel's shot translates over then he'd be a good grab as well since they need to surround RJ with shooters."
14288,2020-11-02 22:17:05,jmminr,"Youre looking at it the wrong way, he's a guaranteed top 2 of this class, but you can also make a very good case for him being the number 1 point guard. People are undervaluing him by letting him fall out of top 5 territory and as a pistons fan, I love to hear it"
14289,2020-11-02 17:29:50,jmminr,"Winslow is actually a good comparison, some good tools there but it's really unclear what it might look like if he puts it all together"

14292,2020-11-02 23:48:41,jmminr,"exactly what im thinking. Arguable if Nwora is the 2nd best shooter, he definitely is up there with the best and fills a need as a shooter in the 3-4 spot."
14293,2020-11-02 16:06:31,jmminr,Lamelo would still have elite passing and a very good handle though. At worst he can be a backup pg who is the primary ballhandler for a bench unit. Edwards doesn't bring any elite skill. All he brings is his physical profile.

14295,2020-11-02 19:43:02,jmminr,"Assists ain't everything. Hes a very good passer but he's not all that in the half court.

14299,2020-11-02 23:56:43,jmminr,"Nesmith is the only guy I'd feel confident saying is better. Nwora shoots 40% from 3 on pretty high volume, and 80% from the line. 6'7, average athlete, I think he's going to be a really great 25 mpg rotation guy for a long time."
14300,2020-11-02 16:12:39,jmminr,"Edwards also has a good handle while being a better shooter than Ball (albeit both of them have bad shot-selection). I think Edwards at worst will be a smaller Wiggins, which will probably be a backup sg. Unless I see Ball  improve his shooting, his lack of shot creation will hinder his playmaking abilities. Although I'll proudly eat my words if I'm wrong. Ball is certainly one of the most unique prospects we have in this draft, but he just has a ton of flaws to overcome."

I just really disagreed with the NCAA being better than the NBL thing. A league full of college players against a league full of pros suplemented with former NBA players and some Euroleaguers(?).

Doesn't Duke and Kentucky lose to more experienced teams deep in the run/playoffs,(?) those are just players who have been playing together longer and more development. Imagine them up against teams with much more experience and even talent.

The G-League is 100% better competition than the P5. There are tons of great P5 players that are playing in the G-League that are older and more developed."
14305,2020-11-02 15:19:41,jmminr,"There is no mental gymnastics and the Luka Draymond comparison was just too perfect and you had no comeback for it.

A more ""complete prospect"" isn't a better prospect.
Ayton was drafted over Luka for the same reasons. He seemed to have less weaknesses whereas Luka had way more uncertainty.
People were uncertain about how much better euroleague competition was. (Nemanja Bjelica and Nandi De Colo were euroleague MVPS and below average in the league)
Uncertain about Luka shooting 33% from 3
Unathletic 
Bad defense 
Sound familiar?
Not saying he's as good as a prospect as Luka but the idea of an 18 year old who may already be a top 5 passing and rebounding PG who also will be able to play better defense than many all star guards and averaged 17 ppg in a pro league isn't a number one pick is ridiculous."
14306,2020-11-03 00:03:20,jmminr,"Nesmith, Vassell, Joe, Bane, Nwora, Haliburton all shoot very well. It's hard to say who's the best out of the group. I think Joe might be the best pure shooter of the bunch. I know his numbers are down from his freshman year but he has the most mechanically sound shot and moves so well without the ball"
14307,2020-11-03 00:27:10,jmminr,"You don't need 2 years hoping and praying LaMelo busts while Simmons continues his semi-mediocre campaign as a highly lauded #1 overall pick.

14311,2020-11-03 00:12:04,jmminr,"Joe's got a pure stroke for sure. He's gonna have to fill out and find that consistency, but all indicators are he'll be an elite shooter. I don't think I'd put Vassel up there tbh, a lot less volume than the others, and about a 10% ft dropoff to the next couple guys. Either way, lots of good options for teams that need to fill in with a couple shooters. I think Nwora would actually be a great pickup for OKC. He fits their timetable and they don't need to hit a homerun, they need a wing they can pair with Roberson and Dort to add spacing."

I may have grown up during the 80s physical era of bball, but this era has shaped my game, don't expect much defense, as Sasha Pavolovic famously said before being sat down in the playoffs ""My offense is my defense""

Generation X: Most of the celebs that defined Gen X culture were born between 1955 - 1964

1955 - Billy Idol

14352,2020-10-31 12:29:12,jldhbi,"This is one of the reasons why I would definitely start sub Generation Jones in 1958 (1958-1964)  and GenX in 1960. 1958 breaks with Disco and are forward-thinking artists that impacted the 1980's. The turn in musical direction reflects a change in attitude and mentality. 1960-1964 includes many grunge pioneers, most all the Brat Pack, and other GenX icons.

1958 and 1959 include nearly all members of the first 3 all girl ROCK bands ever. The Runaways (which include Joan Jett and Lita Fords), the Go-Go's, and The Bangles. A change in direction, but just the start. But until Gen Jones is accepted, I would have X begin in 1960 where important X people begin.

1960 - Bob Mould (Husker Du), Kim Thayil (Soundgarden)

1961- Henry Rollins (Black Flag), Kim Deal (Pixies/Breeders)

.....for starters."
14353,2020-10-31 08:00:22,jldhbi,"Yeah, that does make sense. And that is an interesting way of how you did that. In what I am talking about, they would all be in the generation that they are influencing. That‚Äôs my point."
14354,2020-10-31 17:51:26,jldhbi,Agreed
14355,2020-10-31 08:04:37,jldhbi,"I get that, but that usually isn't the case in reality. Usually the people who influence a generation the most are usually either really early members of the generation or the latest members of the previous generation."
14356,2020-10-31 08:13:17,jldhbi,"I know, I know. But let‚Äôs just say that wasn‚Äôt the case. Forget about that other stuff. Does a person like Madonna scream Boomer to you?"
14357,2020-10-31 08:18:26,jldhbi,"Not really, but 1958 is on the cusp between Boomer and Gen X (in my cultural 1940 - 1959 and 1960 - 1979 ranges), so she would have some X traits even if I wouldn't say she is outright Gen X."
14358,2020-10-31 08:26:14,jldhbi,"She would be outright Gen X, at least the first year and numerically on the peak of the Boomer-X transition of 1955-1961, if generations were based on the cultural celebrities impacting said generation."
14359,2020-10-31 08:32:05,jldhbi,"I guess but that would create really wacky generations, like 1875 - 1894 Lost Generation, 1895 - 1914 Greatest Generation, 1915 - 1934 Silent Generation, 1935 - 1954 Boomers, 1955 - 1974 Gen X, 1975 - 1994 Gen Y, 1995 - 2014 Gen Z"

14394,2020-12-12 22:23:32,kbv7at,This isn't a big board it's a mock draft. Edwards is a top 30 guy for me for sure. Also neither are better than Keyontae or David Johnson.

Brother, prazer em encontrar mais um brasileiro aqui.  
Sobre a sua quest√£o, eu deixarei um link para uma foto minha atual, na qual eu acredito estar com o cabelo bem na forma e tamanho do cabelo do Jaden na foto que voc√™ publicou (o corte nem tanto), e se voc√™ concordar que est√°, eu te digo o que tenho feito.  


Google Translator:  
 Hello, you!   
Brother, nice to meet another Brazilian here.   
Regarding your question, I will leave a link to a current photo of me, in which I believe my hair is in the shape and size of Jaden's hair in the photo you published (the cut not so much), and if you agree that it is , I tell you what I've been doing."

14410,2020-12-10 19:45:27,kamdg3,They admitted the decision was more just because it would have been inconvenient for the schedule.
14411,2020-12-10 20:13:35,kamdg3,"im hoping Jaden Smith shows up in Cobra Kai season 4 or 5, force the guys to rectify this gross grievance lol"
14412,2020-12-10 21:29:58,kamdg3,"I actually really liked the reboot too. Yes, it's the ""Kung Fu Kid,"" but the spirit felt similar. Controversial opinion, but I enjoyed the actual tournament way more in the reboot than the original and the original is one of my favorite movies period. Unfortunately it's not canon, so even they did have the time, they might not do it. Maybe an original vs. reboot conversation would make sense later on."
14413,2020-12-10 23:03:45,kamdg3,"They don‚Äôt have a general rule as to what movies to include on In Review. In fact, Catwoman wasn‚Äôt supposed to be a part of the lineup originally but Tim called an audible. As for Karate Kid, I think the decision of not doing the Jaden one has to do with scheduling as this is supposed to lead up to Cobra Kai S3."
14414,2020-12-10 20:01:54,kamdg3,"There‚Äôs a small photo cameo that links Catwoman with the Batman movies.

Jaden does Kung fu, not karate (fuck Hollywood racism)

Either way, both movies are garbage and neither deserves to be reviewed"
14415,2020-12-10 21:27:03,kamdg3,"Same here. It's very possible since Will Smith is one of the producers. It's pretty much on Jaden whether he wants to do it or not. I haven't seen the Season 3 trailer yet, but I'm also hoping for Terry Silver.

Edit: fixed typo"
14416,2020-12-10 21:28:29,kamdg3,"im pretty sure smith owns the IP lol, so yeah, we def could see it happen. IDK if jaden is even trying to act anymore lol"
14417,2020-12-10 21:34:58,kamdg3,"True. The last thing I saw Jaden in was The Get Down and that was a while back.

I forgot to add that it would be cool to have Hilary Swank on Cobra Kai too. Her character is actually canon."
14418,2020-12-10 16:58:46,kaiqyv,im needing a what say you post reboot

14424,2020-12-10 20:11:14,kaiqyv,TBH I usually hate podcasts and didn't think I'd find interest in this. I watched the beginning purely for the title and just ended up watching the whole thing. Subscribed because it was awesome. :)
14425,2020-12-10 18:36:30,kaiqyv,"Yeah, Sal is definitely crazy"

14443,2020-12-09 08:54:49,k9oaj6,I think he's too busy thinking about blue trees.
14444,2020-12-09 09:08:58,k9oaj6,Jaden just donated 300 pairs of New Balance on Complex Sneaker Shopping to the homeless on skid row. What do you do for those less fortunate lately!?

I like the KK 2010 movie ok enough except for it being called Karate Kid when it was explicitly kung fu. King fu, wushu, and wudan have all been popular in cinema over the last twenty years. Karate, hardly at all. I like the return to karate in CK. As much as I like Jackie Chan, making the Karate Kid about kung fu really left a bad taste in my mouth."

14474,2020-12-08 07:09:35,k8n5me,"> it would be fun like Jaden Smith appear at the Cobra Kai Dojo and starts to challange them with his kung fu 

I'd only like it if he came in and Johnny or Kreese tell him to fuck off and we see or hear from him ever again."
14475,2020-12-07 20:07:33,k8n5me,that would be super nice but idk if their even in the same universe as far as movies go

14477,2020-12-08 00:58:29,k8n5me,"Not gonna happen. Just look at the show The get down, in netflix. Jaden was apart of that show, great show and good ratings from what I understand. Did it get a second season,? No it didn't. You know why? Because Jaden was way to expensive. If you want cobra kai to get canceled,  this would be the fastest way to do it. Now with that said, there was no karate in that movie with Jaden and Jackie chan, its kung fu."
14478,2020-12-10 07:07:47,k8n5me,It‚Äôs Kung Fu and he lives in China and was in Detroit before that. I don‚Äôt think he would just come to LA and see a karate studio and get involved. Plus I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs canon in the same univers
14479,2020-12-07 20:50:27,k8n5me,"How does it fit? Dre lives in Detroit decades after LaRusso left. He goes to China and meets a guy there named Han who killed his wife and child by driving drunk. He wins his tournament with a snake kata he learned from watching some random woman.

I'd rather see Julie show up and lose her shit because LaRusso's bastardizing Miyagi's teachings."

Considering this is an Overbrook film, I can't help but feel this seed was planted when she starred alongside Will Smith in 'Suicide Squad' and that somehow makes it even more annoying for me."

*She was happily walking down the halls with a little skip in her step. When she spots Justin walking ahead of her, she smiles brightly and offers a wave.* ‚ÄúHey, Justin!‚Äù *She greets. She may not be too familiar with him, but they were in the same year so she at least knows who he is.* ‚Äú"
14687,2020-12-23 13:34:08,kis8px,"He's figured out well enough who is whom in his year including new transfers and especially prefects. Mallory never really bothered him all through the years so he had no qualms with saying hello to her. Besides, he needs to talk to people more anyways.

She was still adjusting to the thought of being prefect and the prefect badge she had pinned to her clothes.*

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good way to put it.‚Äù *She smiles and shrugs.* ‚ÄúJust feeling cheerful today. What about you?‚Äù"
14689,2020-12-23 13:51:07,kis8px,"The reality of it is that he needs to find something to make him not think about his family breaking apart but not even he is so crazy enough to just drop that on somebody an ruin their mood.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm having a birthday party later today. You should stop by!‚Äù *She encourages.* ‚ÄúBut if you‚Äôre looking for something right now, you can come with me..?‚Äù"
14691,2020-12-23 14:23:49,kis8px,"His eyes widen a bit as he definitely wasn't expecting that at all, a small smile starts to grow on his face.

""Wait, really? Well damn, happy birthday! I'd could definitely use a little party ti-"" he pauses as he realizes that he was also invited to just go with her to the kitchens. ""I'll go with you, sure."""

14693,2020-12-23 14:51:26,kis8px,"""Right, that sounds good. I'm excited already."" He definitely is since he'll be attending two parties in one day. He also has no issues just hanging with Mallory either, it's the least he could do and she seems cool. 

""So we can go make food and then shoot the shite? I mean haven't thought of anything to do yet but I'll think up something soon enough... maybe."""

14695,2020-12-23 15:06:28,kis8px,"A part of him definitely thought that they would participate in the cooking. He likes cooking, as his mother taught him and his sister as they grew up.

14696,2020-12-23 15:22:59,kis8px,"*Mallory didn‚Äôt know that. She might‚Äôve asked Justin to bake her a cake or something for her birthday. Instead she just doesn‚Äôt want to trouble him by making him help.*

14697,2020-12-23 15:39:52,kis8px,"H doesn't blame her, he was never that vocal about it. His smiles grows a little wider as he follows along to walk with her, that positive energy she's got is very contagious. 

""I'm just glad that I was around."" A few seconds into the silence he speaks up, ""sooooo... random question. Do you go by the nickname 'Mal-Mal?' I've been meaning to ask you for, like, three years now."""
14698,2020-12-23 15:49:32,kis8px,‚ÄúUsually just Mal.‚Äù *She says to him.* ‚ÄúMal-Mal.‚Äù *She repeats to test it out.* ‚ÄúNo ones ever actually ever called me that... kind of sounds like meow meow.‚Äù *She giggles a bit.* ‚ÄúI like it!‚Äù

14701,2020-12-23 17:53:21,kis8px,"Well *that* has his expression going from cheery to sheepish. He just  had a random question which led to a silly nickname, he didn't think that it would mean he could call her that exclusively. 

""Oh my god, now I feel special."""
14702,2020-12-23 17:57:44,kis8px,"*Mallory was just extra like that. Either you went with it, or you didn‚Äôt. Though she was closer with those who just went with it. She tends to have more fun with those type of people.*

‚ÄúYou should!‚Äù *She says as she rounds a corner as the continue towards the kitchens.* ‚ÄúOne day when I‚Äôm on a Chocolate Frog card you‚Äôll be like ‚ÄòOi! It‚Äôs Mal-Mal!‚Äô‚Äù *She says with a little laugh.*"
14703,2020-12-23 18:10:36,kis8px,"He chuckles at the idea and can imagine that she actually might be on a Chocolate Frog Card someday. 

""Honestly, I'd easily just yell it out to you if I see you in public outside of school. If you want I can yell it out loud so people can stare at us like we're mad. Personally, I'm used to it."""
14704,2020-12-23 18:33:33,kis8px,*She shrugs.* ‚ÄúWorks for me. I‚Äôve never really have a damn about people giving me weird looks.‚Äù *She says as she points to her dyed hair and choice of clothing.* ‚ÄúBut now I‚Äôm fully going to expect you to yell it next time I see you or I‚Äôll be *highly* upset.‚Äù
14705,2020-12-23 18:43:11,kis8px,"Well that's strange. Justin figured that in the 2050s there would be virtually nobody left alive who would object to dyed hair or somebody's personal sense of style but he may just be na√Øve. If anything, he thinks she looks very nice.

""Oh!"" He says in exasperated nervousness, ""well then I better deliver. I don't wanna upset you. I'll happily shout it out the next time I randomly see you regardless of where we are... with my luck it'll be at a funeral or at church or something."" He didn't even consider if Mallory would ever even be in a church."
14706,2020-12-23 18:48:43,kis8px,"*Mallory didn‚Äôt experience too much judgment at school. Most of the students were nice and why she often preferred Hogwarts to her school life. It mostly happened around her family and their friends. Mostly because her clothing choices were from Muggle stores.*

‚ÄúThat won‚Äôt happen.‚Äù *She smirks.* ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt get into a church. Tried once and just couldn‚Äôt get past the doorway. Denied entrance.‚Äù"
14707,2020-12-23 19:23:16,kis8px,"It seems that Justin has a bit of a luxury of being rather disconnected to his pureblood roots. His extended family largely had no issue with how he expressed himself. Sure, he's a bit eccentric in their eyes but they love him enough... though that might be because he's not one of the family squibs.

""Really? I'd say you could blend right in, it's not like we'll burst into flames if we see Jesus or anything. Teagan and I snuck into a church once, we claimed to use witchcraft and dipped out hands in holy water then pretended that it burnt. Great places, those churches."""
14708,2020-12-23 19:27:34,kis8px,"*At first Mallory feels bad. Maybe Justin was religious or something and she thought she‚Äôd made a bad joke. She finds herself laughing a little at his story though.* ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs funny. I bet the people inside were freaking out, huh?‚Äù"
14709,2020-12-23 19:32:29,kis8px,"""Not too much,"" he says with a bit of a cheeky smile, ""not until after we left. Mum later found out that the holy water started to smell strong after we touched it. Turns out it we turned it into vodka on accident.""

He shakes his head with a sigh of slight disappointment. ""To this day I have not been able to replicate that kind of transfiguration."""
14710,2020-12-23 19:44:33,kis8px,‚ÄúDamn. Talk about a miracle! I heard Jesus turned water into wine but you‚Äôre out here turning it into vodka.‚Äù *She chuckles a bit.* ‚ÄúShame you can‚Äôt repeat it. Birthday girl could use a drink.‚Äù
14711,2020-12-23 19:47:18,kis8px,"""Cheers to that.""

He chuckles along with her as they would reach the Grand Staircase and head further down. ""Birthday girl can have a drink if she wants one, I mean I'm sure there's going to be a party tonight but unless you want to start early?"" Start early so that she and he can forget their problems a bit more quickly, a brilliant plan."
14712,2020-12-23 19:58:51,kis8px,"‚ÄúOh?‚Äù *She asks with piqued interest. Definitely not opposed to the idea, but a little surprised by it.* ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt object to it.‚Äù *She shrugs but is grinning.* ‚ÄúDo you smoke at all?‚Äù"
14713,2020-12-23 20:19:32,kis8px,"""Not really,"" he says, ""well not *cigarettes* anyways. I tried hookah with my muggle friends once but that was it. Aside from that, I haven't done anything else."""

‚ÄúNever tried hookah, but bet it‚Äôs nice.‚Äù *She nods. Eliminating those two options, she was hinting at something else. Perhaps he‚Äôd see Mal at a party before, smoking away on her pipe in a corner some where.*"
14715,2020-12-23 20:26:06,kis8px,"He had but he figured she was smoking tobacco like some Englishman in the Victorian Era. His wistful gaze sets itself on her as he starts to come understand what she meant. 

""Oh shite..."" he says, ""if not cigarettes then... are you smoking crack? Maybe opium?"" If anything it was probably just marijuana but that's his third guess."
14716,2020-12-23 21:02:37,kis8px,"‚ÄúStraight crack.‚Äù *She nods with a grin. Then scratches her arm.* ‚ÄúJust need a fix, man. Come on, help me out?‚Äù *She chuckles.* ‚ÄúNah dude, none of that. Just your typical devil‚Äôs lettuce.‚Äù"
14717,2020-12-23 21:07:07,kis8px,"""No.. I have no money. Leave me alone,"" he plays along with her scratching her neck as he pretends to inch away. After a chuckle he nods, so it was his third guess.

""Okay cool, I wouldn't mind trying that one day. I don't really know where to get it though."""
14718,2020-12-23 21:47:26,kis8px,"‚ÄúHmmm.... if only you knew someone.‚Äù *She tapped her chin thoughtfully. Then a grin broke out.*

‚ÄúTell you what.‚Äù *She decides.* ‚ÄúWe can drink a bit now, and if there‚Äôs a party tonight I‚Äôll find you and we can smoke. How about that?‚Äù"
14719,2020-12-23 22:20:48,kis8px,"Justin shrugs and figures it's not the worst idea ever. He still needs to be distracted as Christmas rolls in and Mal-Mal is giving him a lovely opportunity.

14721,2020-12-23 23:02:38,kis8px,"""Yeah, that's what I meant...heh."" He nods and smiles along as he totally didn't mean to be that vague or anything. Eventually they leave the Grand Staircase and are closer to the kitchens. Justin's pretty quiet at that point with a dreamy look in his eye."

14755,2020-12-21 02:58:44,kh7sps,"Because jaden smith lets his parent do whatever they want. He does movies, and can sing and is totally cool to his parents. I wish i could go live with Jaden smith."
14756,2020-12-21 03:37:18,kh67sn,Now if we could just be a country that doesn‚Äôt rely on the charity of celebrities to get food and water to people who need it.
14757,2020-12-21 05:57:17,kh67sn,All I can think of seeing this is that movie where Will Smith says ‚Äú Don‚Äôt let anybody say you can‚Äôt do something. You got a dream you gotta protect it ‚Äú.
14758,2020-12-21 07:25:13,kh67sn,Are we supposed to credit the parents every time an adult does something? Jaden smith is 22 years old
14759,2020-12-21 01:44:12,kh67sn,He used to seem like a shit kid but man he‚Äôs become a wonderful adult
14760,2020-12-21 06:35:30,kh67sn,I see he suffers from the same hand placement issue as Ricky Bobby.
14761,2020-12-21 08:07:25,kh67sn,Now if Jada could only unfuck her son's friend....
14762,2020-12-21 08:06:28,kh67sn,"Why is the guy who said ""how can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real?"" doing better than the US government?"
14763,2020-12-21 10:16:19,kh67sn,This dude is a sweetheart! Go get em karate kid!!!!
14764,2020-12-21 05:10:54,kh67sn,Looks like he's finally getting past those weird awkward teenage years and coming into his own. This is good to hear
14765,2020-12-21 04:10:46,kh67sn,Wish my parents were rich and I could do humanitarian work. No /s.
14766,2020-12-21 07:55:17,kh67sn,I like how they bring up parenting skills but leave out money.
14767,2020-12-21 06:30:56,kh67sn,"This is awesome and their kids have turned out great, but they really don‚Äôt have great parenting skills. They allowed their daughter to be sexualized at a very young age and pushed her (I‚Äôm not sure about jaden) to be active in Hollywood to gain stardom when she was young as well. That doesn‚Äôt sit right with me, but I‚Äôm glad they both turned out ok"
14768,2020-12-21 06:40:57,kh67sn,After the confession of jada that she was  cheating on will. I feel just sorry for him. He deserves better.
14769,2020-12-21 10:14:00,kh67sn,"Well the fact that‚Äôs the govt gave $600 to its people after 8 months says a lot.  Govt isn‚Äôt here to help, it‚Äôs here to oppress."
14770,2020-12-21 08:13:10,kh67sn,Is Jada really a good mom though?
14771,2020-12-21 10:13:47,kh67sn,"You‚Äôre not going to like this Reddit, but this post gives me the irrits!This family is filthy rich . Like - never spend all their money in a life time - rich. America is full of families like this. This young man‚Äôs privilege allows him to do this. It is commendable that he is making a difference. But, I think we need to name that the very, very rich doing a little for the many, many poor is really lip service. Big changes need to happen (like taxing the rich properly). Sorry to be a Debbie Downer."
14772,2020-12-21 09:44:31,kh67sn,"If I have a lot of money, I would help so much more than I do now too."
14773,2020-12-21 09:52:32,kh67sn,I would do the same if had milions in my pocket
14774,2020-12-21 02:51:13,kh67sn,Aren‚Äôt they Scientologist?
14775,2020-12-21 01:54:12,kh67sn,Aww. I remember him from that one episode of The Suite Life of Zack and Cody
14776,2020-12-21 08:59:15,kh67sn,"They really let their kids be kids, and let them do what makes them happy."
14777,2020-12-21 10:02:48,kh67sn,Who actually gives a fuck what the motives are behind the PR. It may well be to remain relevant or it could be something this kid actually wants to do. People are benefiting from it either way
14778,2020-12-21 11:35:32,kh67sn,"Even though I'm don't  care about his music, that's pretty amazing."
14779,2020-12-21 16:36:15,kh67sn,Who knew hiring a PR team for your children would be considered good parenting?
14780,2020-12-21 09:15:16,kh67sn,And why he stands like a mannequin?
14781,2020-12-21 09:17:14,kh67sn,"He might not be the best actor, but best human in the making ^^"
14782,2020-12-21 09:32:32,kh67sn,I wish my parents bought me pr stunts like this :(
14783,2020-12-21 09:55:43,kh67sn,Let‚Äôs give out trophies for using dad‚Äôs money.
14784,2020-12-21 10:02:36,kh67sn,Good guy to get tattooed on your thigh.
14785,2020-12-21 08:36:20,kh67sn,I think it‚Äôs just his father jada is a cheating lying bitch
14786,2020-12-21 09:02:33,kh67sn,Will have more to do with this than Jada.
14787,2020-12-21 08:51:27,kh67sn,"No, they had money and connections."
14788,2020-12-21 09:08:24,kh67sn,Easy to do when you have all his resources.
14789,2020-12-21 09:34:16,kh67sn,"Yeah good parenting skills, and maybe millions of dollars too."
14790,2020-12-21 09:38:41,kh67sn,"And they also have a billion dollars, that helps."
14791,2020-12-21 09:38:45,kh67sn,"His parents do not have good skills, they have good money."
14792,2020-12-21 10:03:39,kh67sn,"Can we like... stop praising this behaviour as something extraordinary?
This is the absolute minimum rich people should be obligated to do so. I mean actors are not directly to blame but people like Hollywood execs or Elob Musk got rich through merciless exploitation of thise Jaiden Smith is currently trying to help. A lot of ruch people are even directly to blame for the water problem in Flint. Why are we not demanding under threat of violence or death that they themselves pump out every penny they stole to fix it?
Same issue with poor people. Smoth's food truck is only meeded because people are deliberately not payed enough to survive. Why are we not pulling an 1812 and force their empmoyers with a 12gauge in their ass to pay them 20 an hour"
14793,2020-12-21 07:50:39,kh67sn,"I am so sick about hearing about this entire family.  I don't care what they do, I'm just sick of hearing about it.  Just shut up Smiths.  No more news about you anywhere, plz.  Shu hu hu hut upppppppppppppppppppppppppppp."
14794,2020-12-21 09:18:15,kh67sn,"But Flint water is safe. It has been for years now, no point in sending additional clean water."
14795,2020-12-21 09:34:05,kh67sn,Nothing to do with parenting skills. These celebrities should worry less about their public image and use their status to make their fans voices heard. Start calling out the failures of their government and the elected officials that are responsible.
14796,2020-12-21 09:38:12,kh67sn,The whole smith family is a big ass meme at this point
14797,2020-12-21 10:53:13,kh67sn,No they just have money lmao
14798,2020-12-21 08:48:16,kh67sn,"Guy with tons of money he got from his parents, no skills and no job spends his days doing the only thing he's capable of doing while staying in the spotlight."
14799,2020-12-21 07:32:11,kh67sn,The headline should read ‚ÄúTeenager who Inherited millions from his parents does some good PR‚Äù
14800,2020-12-21 03:22:33,kh67sn,Spending mommy and daddy‚Äôs money on something positive
14801,2020-12-21 08:31:44,kh67sn,Plus he dated Kylie Jenner before all her plastic surgery and money. He‚Äôs really out there doing God‚Äôs work
14802,2020-12-21 08:38:59,kh67sn,I love you restaurant??
14803,2020-12-21 08:42:29,kh67sn,He‚Äôs like a little Tom Cruise.  Weirder than hell but does bro things.  Little filthy rich kid having social responsibility.  Kudos
14804,2020-12-21 08:42:57,kh67sn,Is it canon that someone tweeting about Jaden must capitalise every word?
14805,2020-12-21 08:59:17,kh67sn,He's fuckin great. He's also to thank for the new studio that John Green used to shoot Crash Course European History. Legend.
14806,2020-12-21 09:01:24,kh67sn,But all people know him by is his embarrassing dumb teen tweets
14807,2020-12-21 09:02:22,kh67sn,"Yes, this is a classic reflection of good parenting skills"
14808,2020-12-21 09:12:03,kh67sn,I think it's all Will.
14809,2020-12-21 10:53:54,kh67sn,When‚Äôs he disappearing like he said he would?
14810,2020-12-21 11:10:40,kh67sn,This is the first non-stupid thing I've heard him say or do. Good on him.
14811,2020-12-21 11:13:22,kh67sn,I talked a lotta shit about Jaden in my youth with my friends.  But ho boy did he age like the finest fucking wine.
14812,2020-12-21 11:14:13,kh67sn,"Great thing to do but these kids are broken. Have you heard them talk? I feel bad for them, they think they are space aliens and not human in a class of their own. Distorted upbringing, wouldnt say the best parenting."
14813,2020-12-21 12:28:15,kh67sn,"Will has shown a whole generation it's ok to be gay, well...after his scandal with Benny Medina came to light."
14814,2020-12-21 07:21:44,kh67sn,Well they also have a lot of money
14815,2020-12-21 08:32:30,kh67sn,As long as it has nothing to do with $cientology.... I‚Äôm a bit suspicious of their past involvement...
14816,2020-12-21 09:23:30,kh67sn,"Oh, look, a civil Karen."
14817,2020-12-21 07:56:20,kh67sn,"How long til he is 35?
I am glad that he's doing this, but scientology usually isn't that benevolent of a religion is it?

I think he's playing the long game. 
Still, like it says... Still being a bro"
14818,2020-12-21 05:18:04,kh67sn,Sousa like quite an entanglement
14819,2020-12-21 06:46:24,kh67sn,"Ikr. Of course not to downplay what is clearly a good deed, but this should be the fucking government's job. Its what they pay them for after all."
14820,2020-12-21 07:19:22,kh67sn,"As a european, thats what i think all the time when you post charity stuff and hospital bills"
14821,2020-12-21 07:53:07,kh67sn,I remember people saying he's bad or what not like some beggars even tho he's doing such a nice initiative by himself. It's people like those who actually need to change to be a better person.
14822,2020-12-21 16:00:48,kh67sn,Why does he look like the mannequin from I am Legend.
14823,2020-12-21 09:41:51,kh67sn,"What should we rely on? Forced charity?

Edit: do you guys not like efficient help? And isnt private charity just cutting out extra steps to helping those in need?"
14824,2020-12-21 09:01:10,kh67sn,Watched it again yesterday on the telly and just found out the kid in it is Jaden. Will Smith sure tried to kickstart his acting career.
14825,2020-12-21 10:32:11,kh67sn,What movie
14826,2020-12-21 08:16:19,kh67sn,His moms getting her cheeks clapped by dudes Jaden's age and this skid row food truck happened back in July last year
14827,2020-12-21 08:23:04,kh67sn,"Do you really think he would have this wealth, be this charitable and be famous enough for people to take notice if it weren‚Äôt for his parents? It could just as easily be either of us in this photo if we were birthed by rich, talented and famous parents."
14828,2020-12-21 08:24:44,kh67sn,They did make him rich as a mother fucker. That helps when you want to be charitable
14829,2020-12-21 08:09:36,kh67sn,"I would say yes it is absolutely fair to credit Will and Jada with Jaden‚Äôs upbringing. They‚Äôve both publicly seemed to be great parents and have produced two excellent kids. 

I‚Äôm 22 and I thank my dad for almost everything I am."
14830,2020-12-21 07:32:05,kh67sn,Yes but only partially
14831,2020-12-21 08:36:37,kh67sn,Credit is going to both of them. Which I don't see the problem with. Also to most adults 22 is still a baby. It'd be weird if he were 30
14832,2020-12-21 11:51:05,kh67sn,"Yeah, it‚Äôs strange to jump directly to ‚Äúwow, what great parents‚Äù just because they are popular in the public eye. 

I‚Äôd put very little of the positive things I do down to my parents, and would be slightly offended if someone tried to downplay my achievements as something my parents are responsible for. 

Respect to Jaden for doing what he does, he seems like a good guy."
14833,2020-12-21 01:50:17,kh67sn,"He was a teenager doing and saying the cringe shit we all did and said as teenagers, he just had a huge spotlight on him when he did that most of us were fortunate not to have."
14834,2020-12-21 02:57:22,kh67sn,Be glad your cringy messages will be forgotten. His wont
14835,2020-12-21 06:19:32,kh67sn,every human ever has gone through a shit kid phase
14836,2020-12-21 02:03:24,kh67sn,When was he a shit kid? I only ever remember thinking all their kids were turning out great.
14837,2020-12-21 09:07:21,kh67sn,And his music is awesome. I would suggest anyone who likes that genre to give it a shot. Some of his songs are just straight bangers .
14838,2020-12-21 10:03:04,kh67sn,People hate on him but he really didn‚Äôt do anything bad. He just said some cringey shiton twitter lol that‚Äôs literally all. He was like 14.
14839,2020-12-21 06:19:50,kh67sn,Hasn‚Äôt he? You gotta respect him for what he does. He seems like a good person.
14840,2020-12-21 10:04:56,kh67sn,I mean he‚Äôs a weirdo but he‚Äôs not mean or anything.
14841,2020-12-21 17:03:49,kh67sn,"Why is this still being held against him? He's doing actual good in this world, but you're gonna bring up some pointless tweet he made years ago. Like you never said stupid shit as a kid?"
14842,2020-12-21 10:07:37,kh67sn,Because the US government in not a bunch of 14 years old.
14843,2020-12-21 07:36:17,kh67sn,"Local governments typically have listings of active NGOs and clubs that do charity work, amongst other social services. Doing charity work is less about being rich and more about actually doing it."
14844,2020-12-21 06:31:34,kh67sn,Try looking outside of the U.S. $1 goes a lot farther in developing countries. A small donation can go a long way.
14845,2020-12-21 06:27:17,kh67sn,"That's a shit comment.

I've been wealthy, I've been homeless, and everything in-between.

Even when I had nothing, I still helped.

I actually have no idea who this kid is, other than I know his parents are actors. The media shits on rich people and say they do nothing.

So, here's someone doing something, and that's what you have to say?

When you're cold, when you're hungry, when you don't know if you get to eat tomorrow, you don't care if the person is rich or poor. You know they're helping you, which is more than most."
14846,2020-12-21 08:12:53,kh67sn,Both are important.
14847,2020-12-21 08:11:52,kh67sn,Completely disagree.
14848,2020-12-21 08:15:29,kh67sn,Think they were basically separated at the time she had an affair or whatever. She is honest about it and he knows. Doesn't seem that deep.
14849,2020-12-21 05:27:49,kh67sn,They have publically denied it multiple times.
14850,2020-12-21 02:56:15,kh67sn,Does that make the food truck or water taste worse?
14851,2020-12-21 05:48:56,kh67sn,I don't believe they are
14852,2020-12-21 10:03:45,kh67sn,"it's easier, not easy. He could waste it on cars and watches and whatnot like so many others, but he's an environmentalist and runs projects to help people in need. That's remarkable to say the least"
14853,2020-12-21 07:48:29,kh67sn,no because he's not a teenager anymore and these are his own choices ?
14854,2020-12-21 06:21:22,kh67sn,"i mean he was the protagonist of karate kid, i'm sure he has some money of his own"

He was put on paid leave, and had medical treatment, which didn't cost him anything. The only inconvenience is that the hospital wasn't the cleanest and he had to stay within his district hospital. 

My grandma who was hospitalized for one night earlier this year for kidney issues was billed 95k. Fortunately it was covered by Medicare. Shit like this scares me."

14868,2020-12-21 09:09:35,kh67sn,">Two excellent kids

So... Which one isn't excellent?"
14869,2020-12-21 09:23:17,kh67sn,Ah yeah just comfortably ignore Will Smith‚Äôs first kid who wouldn‚Äôt make the perfect family picture
14870,2020-12-21 11:19:01,kh67sn,All I can think of when how great people say the Smith parents are is that picture of their daughter at 13 in bed with an adult dude without a shirt on. They tried to explain it away but no amount of explaining makes it okay.
14871,2020-12-21 08:53:10,kh67sn,"I'm 35 and that's a pretty condescending attitude to young adults. In my country you're a legal adult at 18, and should be treated as such. By referring to young adults as Babies, you're being condescending and setting a tone in the conversation where little is to be expected of them, creating a bias. Which is unfair on a generation that have been given the shittiest stick and still expected to work to the knuckle by boomers unwilling to pay them basic pay."

14875,2020-12-21 02:10:31,kh67sn,"He wasn‚Äôt, he just went through puberty in the spotlight. And honestly he handled it way better than a lot of people who got famous without a choice and was mocked and ridiculed by magazines, tv shows and everyone with a Twitter account."

14879,2020-12-21 06:34:41,kh67sn,"Idk if their comment was necessarily shitting on Jaden for being rich, I took it at face value that the OP (like myself) wishes they had the money and ability to be charitable and help people like Jaden is doing, the only reason Jaden is able to open a food truck to help people is because of his money and connections, I too wish I was able to do this but because of my financial situation I‚Äôm not able to, I‚Äôm glad Jaden can and hope someday I‚Äôll be able to as well"
14880,2020-12-21 10:37:01,kh67sn,"Dude, what? It is obviously much, MUCH, harder to help people if you're poor. When you're poor not only do you not have the money at your disposal that a rich person has, but you also have significantly less time and stability. When you're working 2 jobs, hell even just 1 full time job; when you're trying to maintain friendships; raise a family; maybe you're going to school part time, what do you have to offer people? 

And on the other hand, rich people are so incredibly privileged, even if they got rich only from their own hard work (literally never the case, but whatever), to be wealthy is the ultimate privilege in our world. They not only have more money, but much more free time, and, very importantly, an ability to create more free time for themselves.

I agree with the sentiment that you should always be good and help as much as you can, but it's obviously much easier, and much more impactful, when rich people decide to help.

You've got a real shit opinion for calling the other guy's comment shit. I mean you say you were homeless and yet you're so fucking stupid as to defend the child (Jaden Smith) of a man (Will Smith) who is worth 350 MILLION FUCKING DOLLARS, for spending less than 0.01% of that on inefficient care for the less fortunate? Either you've never been homeless, or more likely, you've fallen wildly out of touch with reality since you've become wealthy yourself."

A culture change is obviously necessary. Just look outside. But our current system incentivizes greed. Our laws only encourage that. People with good intentions and nothing else will always fail against those with the power and money to buy laws. 

For example, I walked past a local kiosk today where a woman was asking people to do a ‚Äúcompassion exercise to better the world.‚Äù In the face of systemic pressure, that sort of thing will be the first to go due to any number of things. She needs to eat first before she can help others. I dunno how long she can keep up what she‚Äôs doing with her resources. In contrast, big biz's PR and influence are way too strong.

For example, Uber and Lyft had the Mothers against drunk driving spokesperson to help sponsor proposition 22 in California. This proposition made it so their drivers would not receive adequate compensation or health benefits while they do their job. It‚Äôs an insidious proposition, disguised as a way to keep drivers ‚Äúin charge, by being independent contractors,‚Äù and a way to keep drunk drivers off their streets. Why is that? Because they threatened to take their business away from California if prop 22 wasn‚Äôt passed.

I could personally go out and fully invite 2-3 homeless people to fucking live with me permanently, and it would still be worthless compared to what someone with just 5 million dollars can do. 

Where it really becomes propaganda though is the news/social media/whatever platform. ""MOTHER OF FIVE GRADUATES COLLEGE, WORKS 4 JOBS, AND WASHES HER NEIGHBORS' CARS FOR FREE."" What a great person, only, I can't live up to that, few can. But still, those great people are used against normal people, like weaponized goodness, ""why can't you get a job? Why don't you help more? Single mothers work 2 jobs and go to school you know? I saw a story about so and so the other-"" you know what I mean. The personal achievements of others is used as a way of guilting individuals, taking the spotlight away from the actual assholes, corporations.

I'd also like to add, things like giving a homeless person beans or shoes or whatever, is a bandaid solution, much of what you suggest is. It doesn't solve any problems, only suppresses them. Sure that one homeless person has some beans now, but what about the rest? Even if everyone gave the homeless beans, well, they're still homeless. These are systemic problems, that of course can be aided by good deeds, but never fixed solely from the kindness of individuals.

Finally, like I said above, if you are capable of personal responsibility, go for it, it's obviously a good thing to volunteer, but don't claim that it's something everyone is capable of.

Also just to clarify propaganda in the US currently; our propaganda is obviously not like Nazi Germany propaganda, in fact it isn't even explicit propaganda at all, it's discreet, hidden, propaganda. Just watch [They Live](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096256/), simple and goofy, but effective and true with it's message."

I was sad for a while cause I felt hopeless cause those thoughts were compounded by the fact that this is happening everywhere around the world and I felt useless. But later on I found an organisation near my area that asked for volunteers and I was in high school at the time so I joined and they taught that you can do something even if it's a pair of school shoes that are really beat up someone who goes to school bare foot would appreciate them(my own experience) that if you feel like you can do give something even if it's as little as one Rand do it.

But don't you see that it is privilege to even be able to consider others at all? Many live in such a way that they constantly must ensure their own survival, let alone others. Is the homeless person lazy if he walks past another homeless person and doesn't give him the last of his sandwich? Is the single mother irresponsible if she doesn't think to donate her old clothes because her life is so hectic? Or am I obligated to give away my savings, my extra money, just because I want to help the less fortunate? Maybe my way of helping is educating people on this very topic, maybe the mother's way of helping is raising her kids as best she can.

What I am saying is individual effort is crushed by systemic pressure. Case in point - Recycling. When only 10% of all plastics we use today is not recycled, in the long run individual effort is almost meaningless when big corporations continue to deceive people into thinking the plastics they manufacture can be re-used, when 90% of goes to landfills, gets burned, or thrown into the sea. Individual kumbaya effort cannot overturn systemic pressure.

That said, legislation is tricky. To continue my example, California has banned single use plastic bags for groceries. Now the only plastic bags you can buy here are thicker bags that are even worse for environment. The solutions to our problems will be complex, but simply wishing people to be better isn't even a strategy at all. What we really need is to start at the beginning, and that is in our education system which poses another problem.

15079,2020-12-18 02:05:50,kfa3ov,Edwards taking over
15080,2020-12-18 01:53:30,kfa3ov,Damn I know its preseason but it's dead in here
15081,2020-12-18 03:56:52,kfa3ov,If you don't like that you don't like preseason basketball
15082,2020-12-18 04:15:01,kfa3ov,"This game is completely meaningless, but it's pretty hype."
15083,2020-12-18 02:01:03,kfa3ov,"Edwards loose with the ball, but has had two great contests."
15084,2020-12-18 03:06:35,kfa3ov,Imagine getting 2 Ts in 3 preseason games
15085,2020-12-18 01:48:13,kfa3ov,"Luka is getting to the rim, a lot easier when Jrue isn't defending him. LOL"
15086,2020-12-18 01:52:48,kfa3ov,"Richardson has been looking good, 2018 Richardson good. That was a push off tho...."

15089,2020-12-18 03:57:19,kfa3ov,"It's the 3rd strings in a pre-season game so meaningless and all, but the last minutes were impressively terrible.

edit:: and now for the thrilling OT."
15090,2020-12-18 02:06:39,kfa3ov,Why did you try to save that Naz...
15091,2020-12-18 02:37:39,kfa3ov,Okogie is the defender 6er fans thinks Simmons is.
15092,2020-12-18 02:36:11,kfa3ov,Kleber is such a great defender.
15093,2020-12-18 02:37:38,kfa3ov,I need to see Luka step it up in the second half
15094,2020-12-18 03:19:50,kfa3ov,RHJ looks like a slasher movie villain
15095,2020-12-18 03:27:46,kfa3ov,"That 3 point shooting of the Mavs is scary good. They will obviously cool down a bit during the regular season, but those preseason games should build a little hype for Dallas."
15096,2020-12-18 03:35:19,kfa3ov,We're getting 50 wins this year. Have some faith üôè
15097,2020-12-18 02:58:26,kfa3ov,Luka playing more and more Harden-y. This sub gon' turn on him lol.
15098,2020-12-18 01:56:05,kfa3ov,i almost wanted to die
15099,2020-12-18 02:21:24,kfa3ov,What a pass by Johnson
15100,2020-12-18 02:26:38,kfa3ov,Mavs are good about just being ready to shoot. 10/21 from 3 and I'd bet 4-5 of those 3's had a hand up a split second too late.
15101,2020-12-18 02:38:24,kfa3ov,Doriannnn
15102,2020-12-18 02:40:22,kfa3ov,Impressive Luka layup to end the half. He knew that Kat was right there and hit a weird bank layup.
15103,2020-12-18 03:00:53,kfa3ov,Dwight Powell is barbecue chicken
15104,2020-12-18 03:21:32,kfa3ov,Love it
15105,2020-12-18 03:23:22,kfa3ov,Richardson 68% from 3 in the preseason üòç

15107,2020-12-18 03:24:48,kfa3ov,James is such an unselfish player
15108,2020-12-18 03:31:53,kfa3ov,Is Rubio suppose to be the starting pg for the Wolves?
15109,2020-12-18 03:06:37,kfa3ov,You get techs for halfway raising ur arms?
15110,2020-12-18 01:55:23,kfa3ov,everyone prob in their own team sub
15111,2020-12-18 04:22:05,kfa3ov,Yeah we put in our third stringers against wolves starters in the 4q and never looked back
15112,2020-12-18 01:31:55,kfa3ov,fingers crossed
15113,2020-12-18 05:03:12,kfa3ov,Pretty good considering Luka was 0/6
15114,2020-12-18 04:16:04,kfa3ov,"If the preseason is something to go by, he's likely coming off the bench."
15115,2020-12-18 05:02:17,kfa3ov,Oh is that why Luka shot 33 percent with 4 turnovers?
15116,2020-12-18 05:41:19,kfa3ov,What's new? :D
15117,2020-12-18 05:14:55,kfa3ov,uhhhh do you see his plus minus? he was +21 idgaf what his splits were lmao

15164,2020-12-17 01:50:02,kenfim,"It was really weird how the sequel to Karate Kid reboot vanished.

AND THEY DON'T FIGHT KARATE, WHAT THE FUCK"
15165,2020-12-17 01:59:07,kenfim,"The New 52 has effectively become an Elseworld / multiverse counterpart of the Rebirth DCU, if I understand the mess correctly."
15166,2020-12-17 02:33:27,kenfim,"Basically every Terminator after Terminator 2

Except every single attempt at rebooting or continuing the series sucks so *every* Terminator after Terminator 2 is a spinoff."
15167,2020-12-17 02:39:56,kenfim,"This may stretch the term a bit, but DBS kinda made GT irrelevant. GT still has it's fans, but Super is now widely considered the true DBZ follow up."
15168,2020-12-17 02:28:26,kenfim,Isn't there a new Ghostbusters that's in the works that completely ignores that reboot one from a few years ago?
15169,2020-12-17 01:58:35,kenfim,I feel like David Gordon Green‚Äôs Halloween gets talked about a lot more now than the Rob Zombie‚Äôs films. Especially with Green and McBride getting 3 films while Zombie only got 2. Technically Zombie‚Äôs film is considered a remake but the 2010 Karate Kid is as well.
15170,2020-12-17 03:42:10,kenfim,"Ace Combat 7 to Assault Horizon. As it turns out, making its core mechanic an on rails shooter is **not** what people want. The release dates of AC6 to DMC4, ACAH to DmC, and AC7 to DMC5 mostly line up too.

AC6: 2007
DMC4: 2008

ACAH/DmC: 2013

AC7/DMC5: 2019

Funnily enough, both AC7 and DMC5 have a protagonist who are known by an insult starting with 'D', a tan mechanic girl, and an unreasonably tall tower that is a source of great energy and is visited early on, only to get kicked back and making your way back to it, ending off at Mission 20"
15171,2020-12-17 02:15:33,kenfim,Like how pretty much everyone thought Ghostbusters 2016 was a piece of crap that spurned the upcoming Ghostbusters Afterlife to be the real Ghostbusters 3 so the franchise can bounce back?
15172,2020-12-17 02:37:00,kenfim,"That's pretty nonspecific, almost every single reboot with a moderately negative reception (unless the franchise went bust after)

Also even though it was pretty bad, I watched it just because Jackie Chan is the shit"
15173,2020-12-17 01:56:33,kenfim,Jaden Smith Karate Kid was better than the original tbh.  Jackie Chan was good in it and there was a Snake.
15174,2020-12-17 02:17:56,kenfim,"does FFVII remake counts? the game is good, but it feels separate from the original timeline."
15175,2020-12-17 01:52:29,kenfim,"I was going to say The Kung Fu King doesn't sounds as good, but I just said it and it sounds *exactly* as good."
15176,2020-12-17 02:23:51,kenfim,"New 52 technically did happen in the main continuity, it's just that the stuff before New 52 *also* happened as well and the actual universe unaltered by Dr. Manhattan is both timelines combined. Or something."
15177,2020-12-17 10:59:07,kenfim,"Essentially Dr Manhattan pulled an FF7R Sephiroth and altered the past 10 years ago to create the New 52 (with some minor alterations due to Flashpoint's ""Time Boom"" effect). Some characters from the original timeline survived, and the original timeline is bleeding over into the new one, but the new timeline is still the one we're following."
15178,2020-12-17 03:28:11,kenfim,"Except Terminator Resistance, the REAL Terminator 3"
15179,2020-12-17 10:37:51,kenfim,"GT feels like a follow up to dragonball, while super feels like a follow up to Z."
15180,2021-01-08 10:30:18,kenfim,"Say what you want about gt

But in my opinion that ending is the best Dragon ball is ever gonna have"
15181,2020-12-17 14:59:25,kenfim,"Honestly, more movie franchises could benefit from having one ""ignore bad installment free"" card. Like ""autism Predators"" and the like."
15182,2020-12-17 08:56:27,kenfim,Yep made by Ivan Reitmans son Jason as well
15183,2020-12-17 06:40:42,kenfim,"Honestly, that just keeps happening with that series. 

Halloween 4 brought back Michael Myers after Halloween 3 decided to try to go the anthology route. 

H20 either retconned movies 4-6 to bring Jamie Lee Curtis back into the series. 

And Halloween 2018 didn‚Äôt just overwrite the Zombie movies. It overwrote every other Halloween sequel."
15184,2020-12-17 02:20:53,kenfim,But can it beat my favorite version of Ghostbusters 3 which was Ghostbusters The Video Game.
15185,2020-12-17 04:17:33,kenfim,"I'd say it's specific enough. They're referring to franchises abandoning the reboot and going back to the original series. Like the Halloween movies for example. Those Rob Zombie reboots and even most of the sequels are just straight up tossed out in favor of a direct continuation to the original.

But yeah, the Karate Kid reboot was alright. Until I saw Jackie Chan take down a bunch of kids and then it was rad."
15186,2020-12-17 04:54:26,kenfim,"I guess maybe not just ""bad reboot, original story gets continued afterwards"" but also if they're apparently making a reboot just to reach a broader or newer audience. The more unnecessary it feels, the better, like I think all regular Devil May Cry needed to be more well-received in the West was better advertising and to maybe be a bit more approachable for casual players. Changing its whole identity was a bit extreme.

With Karate Kid, the original is pretty timeless in my opinion. There's also that ""getting more with less"" going for it, cause it's pretty simple for the most part. I remember two things from the Jaden Smith movie, one being a joke that he'd go home to his mom and say ""today Mr. Miyagi taught me how to Jacket Off"" then cut to Miyagi being dragged away by the police ""He didn't explain Jacket On!"" And the second is them going to a temple, it's this whole big thing that Miyagi was taught by these enlightened grand masters or whatever, now he's training Jaden with the same powerful techniques. The original was more like ""Miyagi's karate is better because it actually focuses on the spirit of karate, which is more meditative and flowing, unlike Cobra Kai's which uses karate offensively and to use aggression."""
15187,2020-12-17 06:13:01,kenfim,Well... >!It is...!<
15188,2020-12-17 07:36:43,kenfim,"That‚Äôs because >!it‚Äôs not a remake, it‚Äôs a sequel!<"
15189,2020-12-17 01:53:09,kenfim,"Yo, that sounds rad"
15190,2020-12-17 02:17:03,kenfim,"It‚Äôs called The Kung Fu Dream in China. Makes sense they changed it there, since naming a movie about kung fu after some other country‚Äôs martial arts would probably piss off the China."
15191,2020-12-17 01:55:12,kenfim,It sounds like a spaghetti western but with martial arts involved.
15192,2020-12-17 06:19:46,kenfim,I'm pretty sure it was originally an original movie before the studio realized they have the Karate Kid name and slapped the name on it
15193,2020-12-17 02:29:47,kenfim,They tangled the web so hard you would be better off forgetting most of it. Like divergence.
15194,2020-12-17 03:03:19,kenfim,"Some parts of the New 52 happened, the characters introduced post-Flashpoint are still around and the biggest storylines are still canon, but it's mostly in a broad strokes sort of way that will only occasionally be acknowledged."

15196,2020-12-17 01:56:50,kenfim,"I meant Kid, but Kung Fu King sounds dope. That's probably a manga somewhere."
15197,2020-12-17 10:56:08,kenfim,They also removed scenes of the bullies being bullies and they replaced the shady kung fu instructor with a super nice and honourable one to make the Chinese look better. So it's basically a movie about Jackie Chan teaching Jaden Smith to beat up some kids he started picking on for no reason.
15198,2020-12-17 10:24:08,kenfim,"That would make sense, but doesn't it take a few scenes from the Karate Kid, like hands on/hands off?"
15199,2020-12-17 02:49:44,kenfim,"Considering New 52 was supposed to make stuff more accessible to newbies, it‚Äôs ironic that it just served to make the timeline *even more* convoluted later down the line."
15200,2020-12-17 02:38:30,kenfim,Man fuck comic books and their timeline shit
15201,2020-12-17 03:34:55,kenfim,Isn't like all of Aquaman still canon considering he got his origin and Black Manta's origin completely redone by Geoff Johns. Even the whole marriage proposal didn't get finalized until [now in Rebirth](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/m4x1t-du4PXNJ1R4GvXWSHTv0YIOzAlQXEvOxu19turDgASPq2d3xZbrpRjdkQ0kbkt8CRrmJIx_9HjF4mcaOKjEgaFl6XLDlHVt_KM-TVzhMXqOo5tygjZWON2i-e0cINfTnhJScw=s0) so his story arc was completed even when the series moved from New 52.
15202,2020-12-17 02:04:18,kenfim,[Kung Foo Kid](https://megaman.fandom.com/wiki/Kung_Foo_Kid) was an optional boss in Mega Man Star Force 2
15203,2020-12-17 01:57:35,kenfim,"Too late. If you want to leave king to the sequel it's okay, but call the first Kung Fu Prince"
15204,2020-12-17 14:56:19,kenfim,Interracial kiss was removed too I hear.
15205,2020-12-17 18:18:12,kenfim,"Could have been added in reshoots done after they changed the name.

Or i could be completely wrong!"
15206,2020-12-17 03:49:47,kenfim,"I legitimately have no idea what the deal with DC's continuity is thanks to the New 52 and Rebirth stuff, and that's coming from a guy who's pretty up on comics.


What kind of chance does your average Joe have of knowing what the heck's going on?"
