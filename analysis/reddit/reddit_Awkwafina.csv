3,2020-02-04 20:00:36,eyqynm,I thought you were talking about the water. LOL. I was going to say I hate Aquafina. It's too salty.
4,2020-02-05 01:26:22,eyqynm,I don’t like her because I just don’t think she’s funny. Her hosting and skits for SNL were terrible. I have not seen her be good in anything.
5,2020-02-06 07:09:41,eyqynm,I like her show Nora from Queens
6,2020-02-04 21:03:20,eyqynm,I don't like that water brand either. It has a weird mineral aftertaste

9,2020-02-15 23:39:10,ey87pu,"Hello everyone!

We know we were supposed to release the winners yesterday, Friday 14th, but I couldn't make it on time since work got in the way of my plans.

So, we're now aiming to release the winners this thursday, the 20th.

Hope you understand and sorry for the delay."
10,2020-02-03 16:00:13,ey87pu,I feel weird everyday for having lighthouse as my number 1 movie
11,2020-02-03 16:50:28,ey87pu,Where do we vote?
12,2020-02-03 22:11:19,ey87pu,A lot of these are what the Oscars should've been.
13,2020-02-03 15:35:40,ey87pu,Robert Pattinson snubbed again. Otherwise this is a great list
14,2020-02-03 17:29:40,ey87pu,"I liked 1917 more than Parasite, Marriage Story, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, so it's too bad it didn't make ""best film."" Still, great picks and fun categories! I'm happy to see Us get some recognition somehwere."
15,2020-02-03 19:52:32,ey87pu,"Damn,  Michael Abels (Us) got snubbed for score here too, but glad Show Yourself got nominated because I feel that's a better song than Into The Unknown."
16,2020-02-03 15:55:43,ey87pu,Sad that Joker isn’t nominated for best picture but pleased that Uncut Gems is here! Finally some love for the Sandman!
17,2020-02-04 00:56:41,ey87pu,Who's the lead role in Parasite if Song Kang-Ho is supporting? I put him in my leading actor picks.
18,2020-02-03 23:40:58,ey87pu,"None of these nominated ""scores"" are worth to be acclaimed as ""best"". Where's hauntingly dazzling dark ambient of ""The Lighthouse""? Where's Daniel Lopatin's masterfully produced, dynamic, weirdly gorgeous electronic of ""Uncut Gems""? Even ""Color out of Space"" has better score than any of these nominees."
19,2020-02-04 12:55:30,ey87pu,Glasgow from Wild Rose not getting a Best Song nomination is disappointing
20,2020-02-03 17:07:04,ey87pu,Neon will ensure Parasite wins in all its categories so I don't see the point
21,2020-02-03 17:20:08,ey87pu,Nah you've just seen the light.
22,2020-02-03 17:21:52,ey87pu,"This year, subscribers could submit their picks for the nominees, the voting part will be done by the Letterboxd Awards team on discord :)"
23,2020-02-03 17:27:58,ey87pu,"From the original Letterboxd Awards post:

**Who will be making the final decision?**

When  all the nominees are counted, selected and revealed, the Letterboxd  Elite group from our Discord server (what are you waiting to [join us](https://discord.gg/4ez75Xe)?)  will be individually picking their winners from the final list of  nominees. All the votes will be counted and the winner in each category  will be revealed on February 14th (this date can still be changed  depending on how the nominees develop)."
24,2020-02-03 22:24:44,ey87pu,"I was very surprised by that to be fair, especially since the noms are decided by the community's vote"
25,2020-02-04 12:50:25,ey87pu,"I kind of agree and he did get a couple of votes as best actor but most people nominated him for the supporting actor category. 

He also won or was nominated for best supporting actor at a lot of film critic circle awards (the full list on IMDb)"
26,2020-02-03 23:56:23,ey87pu,"People did vote for them, but not enough people for it to be nominated, these were the ones that gather more nominations."
27,2020-02-04 12:43:45,ey87pu,"These films are nominated by the r/Letterboxd community and voted on by the awards committee (which is made up of our most active members on here and discord). Neither Letterboxd itself or Neon have any role in the matter. 

I can still see it winning a lot of categories though. Great movie."
28,2020-02-03 17:32:44,ey87pu,Didn’t spill my beans
29,2020-02-05 05:04:03,ey87pu,I’m a bit confused on where to vote. where do we submit our picks?
30,2020-02-03 17:27:20,ey87pu,Ah okay gotcha.
31,2020-02-03 17:30:51,ey87pu,"Cheers, I didn't see the original post."
32,2020-02-03 15:06:11,ey0yh1,"I live in an ethnically diverse area and kids often have friends across several cultures. One thing that is always present is a person's cultural boundaries. Like, the kids from Thailand might be cool as hell with the kids from Somalia but at the end of the day they don't engage in serious cultural exchange. That sort of thing takes a long time. These kids grow into culturally aware adults but under no circumstances do they ever take on the mannerisms or cultural dress of their friends. So when you consider the examples above you should consider them to be actively seeking to transgress against their own cultural norms rather than seriously considering the aspects of Black culture that they're trying out. All of the women mentioned come from Eastern cultures who have been transplanted into a Western locale. The US and Canada are home to a lot of cultures and are very different from the largely ethnically homogeneous countries of Asia and it seems like many Asians experience a lot of cultural dissonance while they try to assimilate. East Asians can more easily blend into Whiteness because they're light skinned but South Asians are dark skinned and cannot assimilate into Whiteness because their otherness is too evident. This is why Awkwafina's leaning into Blackness is more irritating to a lot of Black folks. Lilly and Liza were never going to be able to be seen the way Awkwafina can be and so their leaning into the other mainstream culture is understandable. I would love for them to actually acknowledge that they owe their success to performing Blackness but I doubt that will happen."
33,2020-02-03 22:49:10,ey0yh1,"I'm not sure about Liza or Awkwafina because I'm not familiar with them, but from what I've seen of Lilly Singh, it doesn't seem to be appropriation on her part.  She's funny without being disrespectful and she's not biting off anyone's culture.  She does at times stereotype her own culture, but I don't think it's with harmful intent and most people who share her background that watch her videos seem to relate.  I never really viewed her as borrowing from Will Smith, but some might feel otherwise.   

That Awkwafina person sounds icky though.  To answer your question about appropriation vs. being yourself...to me, it depends on a person's intent and if they respect other cultures.  I'm part Jamaican and I have no problem with people enjoying aspects of my culture.  They might even learn something from it.  It's when somebody disrespects it or makes stereotypical comments that there's an issue.  So maybe that's what it comes down to, intent and the way a person approaches things.  Sorry this is so long...just my two cents."
34,2020-02-03 06:39:22,ey0yh1,I personally didn't see any real issues upon watching Awkwafina's performance in CRA. I probably need to revist the movie to be sure but I think it is at the very least a concern. It happens way too often where Asian-Americans in hollywood feel that they can use blackness to get ahead in their careers. And perhaps one of the reasons they feel they can do that is because we've allowed them too. It's probably important for us withdraw any support/money from any figure that feels they can use blackness as a stepping stool and drop it the second they don't need it anymore. Creating lanes and holding other minorities accountable for when they dabble in stuff like this is a solution.
35,2020-02-03 15:20:54,ey0yh1,"I think it order to have a true discussion on this issue we also need to talk about the black American relationship with Asian culture. From kung fu movies to anime black Americans have used ""asianess"" (is there an east Asian word for orientalism???) to alleviate oneself from the negative stereotypes of blackness while also maintaining a distinction from whiteness."
36,2020-02-03 11:42:04,ey0yh1,"Happy to be the minority voice if need be but I don't particularly find either of these girls to be appropriators. Its pretty common for brown Asians to lean into black identity as a consequence of their social dislocation. White folk treat them as some variation of black anyway. Black culture has always been welcoming of excluded POC and that must not change. We are special because we don't play purity test games.

What should raise alarm is applying the culture as a costume to be put on and taken off when it's commercially convenient. I raised this distinction between Justin Timberlake and Bruno Mars and I invoke it again with regards to these girls who as far as I know are not treating blackness as an alter ego. Liza is a brown girl from Houston, Beyonce is naturally her hero. Awkwafina doesn't turn into Gwyneth Paltrow when she's on the red carpet. I don't know much about Lily Singh other than the charity work she does for menstrual poverty in Africa and Asia. I have no issue with them."
37,2020-02-03 05:55:58,ey0yh1,[removed]
38,2020-02-03 19:39:37,ey0yh1,"Especially Black women too, sadly. Asian doll (the rapper) and Nicki Minaj come to mind. I think it has to do with black women/dark skin being viewed as inherently more masculine and our attempt to reclaim some femininity through attaching ourselves to notions of Asian femininity and culture. Asian doll literally claims that she is half asian (she is fully black) just because she has supposedly ""interestingly shaped"" eyes. Kinda fucked up and definitely on a similar level to awkwafina. Solidarity can never be accomplished if we keep pointing fingers without looking at ourselves."
39,2020-02-02 19:16:03,ext1nn,Who won Best Battle Angel
40,2020-02-02 19:04:55,ext1nn,These Blankies are feeling the gem!
41,2020-02-02 22:41:48,ext1nn,No surprises unfortunately. I feel like I wasted my time agonizing over my ballot.
42,2020-02-03 02:51:17,ext1nn,Surprised by how little love Ad Astra is getting everywhere.
43,2020-02-02 20:50:56,ext1nn,I had a feeling I should have stumped harder for Her Smell because Griff and David would feel they needed to abstain from including it. Moss had the best lead performance of the year.
44,2020-02-02 21:59:11,ext1nn,So pleasantly surprised that so many of us were able to see PORTRAIT!!
45,2020-02-02 22:45:40,ext1nn,Surprised Portrait got nominations for Picture and Director but the actresses were left out.
46,2020-02-02 22:16:45,ext1nn,"Seeing Midsommar (my movie of the year) on the list and the double Florence Pugh nom - good enough for me! I did my part!

Edit: Just watched Under the Silver Lake last night....realizing I did not watch that before Blankies voting has made me realize that perhaps, I did not fully do my part!"
47,2020-02-02 23:07:53,ext1nn,Sad to see *Monos* locked out – more people need to see that film! Great list overall though.
48,2020-02-02 20:12:34,ext1nn,Should we post our own ballots here?
49,2020-02-03 02:00:26,ext1nn,Cinematography is the most surprising to me.
50,2020-02-03 16:26:44,ext1nn,"Damn, somehow I missed the nominating period this year. I'll just have to post who I *would've* nominated when I assemble my Oscar wish list ballot this week."
51,2020-02-02 20:26:59,ext1nn,Judi Dench in Cats.

It’s my #1 of 2019"
54,2020-02-03 03:06:01,ext1nn,"There seems to be more of a consensus that in other years, but it's not like I expect everyone else to have the same unique picks as me."
55,2020-02-03 05:16:32,ext1nn,I think enough Blankies having seen Little Women that Florence pulled above Brad is pretty freaking surprising.
56,2020-02-03 03:59:53,ext1nn,"I agree with you. My biggest thought from this movie is if it suffers from the ""Blade Runner"" un-needed narration. I feel like the movie would be more fascinating if we weren't inside his head the entire move. I understand he's by himself most of the time so it might be confusing, but still a fascinating thought."
57,2020-02-02 22:46:36,ext1nn,"Noemie Merlant was fairly close, but I think it may have been a matter of people choosing to vote for one or the other."
58,2020-02-03 00:45:42,ext1nn,Probably splitting the vote but you know I doubled up.
59,2020-02-03 02:19:16,ext1nn,".... Why didn't we have a non-English category to vote for it in anyway? Movies like Parasite and Portrait that are hyped enough and fairly widely released are rare enough they can rarely break out into enough people's top lists. Parasite's super exceptional but I saw a bunch of cool foreign films, wish we could have compared our favorites in their own category."
60,2020-02-03 09:16:55,ext1nn,It was my #1 vote for ensemble. Great film.

68,2020-02-02 21:42:09,ext1nn,Respect to the urgently linked Youtube clip so we don’t think you’re a creep.
69,2020-02-03 06:02:58,ext1nn,"Not really, this sub and the podcast have been talking up Little Women for months."
70,2020-02-03 05:27:16,ext1nn,"I would probably be down for a cut of the movie with no narration. Would be pretty austere, but many of my favorite movies are that way anyway. In any case, as a big fan of 2001, I think As Astra is way underrated as a similarly scaled but like philosophically diamatrically opposed scifi epic. Lots to say about our current situation as a species and the whole role of science fiction in that, imo. 

On the whole though Im not really an awards person, I think they tend to be mostly industry horce race stuff, but I hope it gains some esteem bc I think it's genuinely an impactful, fascinating film."
71,2020-02-03 05:17:51,ext1nn,I know what I'm suggesting is more work but personally I'd love to have as many categories as possible. Love seeing what people pick!
72,2020-02-03 14:19:23,ext1nn,"> Movies like Parasite and Portrait that are hyped enough and fairly widely released

Portrait hasn't been widely released. A lot of blankies must have watched it through, er, ""alternative methods"" for it to have placed in multiple categories.

Anyway, I was also surprised there's no non-English category."
73,2020-02-03 03:08:16,ext1nn,I wish we could have gotten Majors in there.
74,2020-02-03 15:11:09,ext1nn,"Ah, right, it's actually a 2020 movie here unless you're a critic. I'm awkwardly saying it has a relatively strong promotional and critical push, unlike Monos for example, which I only even saw because it ran in one theater in Chicago at a time and I felt like it."
75,2020-02-02 02:05:58,exf2st,Was she a dolphin in bojack horseman?
76,2020-02-02 04:12:44,exf2st,"Wait, Sextina Aquafina?!?!?! Yaas!!!"
77,2020-02-02 03:19:42,exf2st,Same and she’s bi what a woman
78,2020-02-02 07:13:16,exf2st,I loved The Farewell. She’s amazing in it.
79,2020-02-02 02:59:02,exf2st,I watched her in Jumanji and fell in love
80,2020-02-02 03:11:01,exf2st,Loved her in Crazy Rich Asians! Her character was queer 🌈
81,2020-02-02 06:26:23,exf2st,"I really love her. But I can’t stand the “Awkwafina” name.

Her real name is so pretty! Nora Lum."
82,2020-02-02 01:23:17,exf2st,Yaaassss.  I love her <3
83,2020-02-02 04:35:44,exf2st,Nora from Queens is hilarious! Fills the gaping hole in my soul broad city left behind.
84,2020-02-02 05:11:54,exf2st,"Uh! Ultimate crush, she's the best! Her show Tawk is amazing."
85,2020-02-02 12:46:47,exf2st,Heh... Not down with her very obvious blackcent. She's cute but I wish she would acknowledge that's not on and speak on it.

87,2020-02-02 09:10:01,exf2st,Where was it confirmed that she is bi?
88,2020-02-02 08:37:56,exf2st,Is that #confirmed? I always got the vibe but never saw anything about it.
89,2020-02-02 10:04:22,exf2st,"Agree totally. She’s awesome in everything I’ve seen her in, but “Awkwafina” sounds like something a shitty soundcloud rapper would call themselves."
90,2020-02-02 11:07:09,exf2st,Awe I didn’t realize that wasn’t her real name. Nora Lum is so pretty!
91,2020-02-02 16:24:25,exf2st,"Isn't it more racist to gatekeep an accent just because of how she looks? She's not mocking people with the accent and she obviously likes that style of rapping. 

What if you told a black person that they shouldn't be speaking without a ""blaccent""?"
92,2020-02-02 12:48:19,exf2st,Kinda sad people down voted your comment. We need to make sure queer spaces are safe for black and brown people and call out racist behavior in our community :(
93,2020-02-04 00:25:01,exf2st,Nah she just made a joke about Nora from Nora from Queens being bisexual as f**** in high school calling it bischool
94,2020-02-02 16:30:09,exf2st,She literally got her start making rap videos on youtube
95,2020-02-02 16:42:29,exf2st,"Yeah i dont see how thats different than telling black person they shouldn't ""talk like a white person""."
96,2020-02-02 19:32:45,exf2st,"She is using black culture (or a cliché of it) for her own benefit without ever speaking out on black issues. Doing an over the top cliché copy of it is another way of mocking. 
The minute she wants to be taken seriously or does interviews she goes back to her normal voice. This is not okay behavior. She only wants to partake in black culture when it's convenient or beneficial to her. It's not gatekeeping either, a lot of non black people share and enjoy black culture respectfully and are loved by black people for it. Cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation are not the same at all! :)"
97,2020-02-02 17:35:07,exf2st,Very well. Then time to switch over to the ol’ grown-up name.
98,2020-02-02 19:35:49,exf2st,"Because ""speaking like a white person"" has never been a cause of discrimination for a black person. Being black, looking black, sounding black have detrimental consequences for black people and are only deemed cool when done by non black people like Awkwafina, Iggy Azalea, Christina Aguilera... On the flipside, assimilation for black people is a way for them to integrate and succeed in a racist system that denigrated blackness."
99,2020-02-02 19:47:41,exf2st,"Uh yeah it has. Plenty of black people discriminate against other black people for talking like a white person. Its a very common thing. I think thats a really negative way of thinking about it, that if a black person talks like that then theyve assimilated and theyre not ""real black"". It reminds me a bit of that line from that song ""can the Sub_bass speak"" by Algiers. Thats a form of racism, and really isnt that far from calling black people uncle toms. 



And as an aside i think its a bit disingenuous to say awkwafina and iggy are in the same stratosphere of appropriation. To me she has more of a new york accent than a blaccent. And christina aguliera is half Hispanic, even if shes white passing. Would you say the same thing about J lo?"

101,2020-02-01 02:19:25,ewxe3y,"Watched the pilot and gave up after 15 minutes or so. Not funny to me, but to each their own."
102,2020-01-31 16:20:25,ewqfp4,Representation and diversity are meaningless terms. Diversity in the west means asian women and black men. Only positive representation matters not negative representation.
103,2020-02-02 22:56:59,ewqfp4,"It's funny how nobody addressed the subject of flawed terminology itself and just redirected the topic to things they wanted to see more of, like positive/negative roles, sports figures, taking issue with Awkwafina."
104,2020-01-31 16:01:26,ewqfp4,I think we should focus less on representation in acting roles and more in professional sports. Sports achievements are hard power and gains legitimate respect from other folks. The stories of AM pro athletes are more compelling than anything I’ve ever seen or expect to see come out of Hollywood.

106,2020-01-31 16:15:50,ewqfp4,"Sure, actually, I'm surprised there aren't more Asians in UFC.  But personally, I still think it's still more beneficial overall that Asians emphasize academics or business success and maintain a higher income bracket than most.  Lots of African Americans have Hoop Dreams stories.  Asian Americans have Harvard Dreams.  They should go the JLin route, get both and still go to Harvard and NBA."
107,2020-01-31 16:20:58,ewqfp4,Cos one fc dominates asia.
108,2020-01-31 16:23:49,ewqfp4,"Re: UFC there are tons of Asian folks in MMA. It’s just that the money is good enough in Asia that they don’t bother coming to the US, combined with the biases of UFC recruiters. There’s great promotions in Asia already like ONE FC, Kunlun, and another one I forget the name of. There was a guy named Dynasty MMA I think who used to post here who wrote up a [good article about it](https://dynastyclothingstore.wordpress.com/).

Tbh no one respects academic or business success (they’ll just say it was “cheating, undeserved, robot culture” and so on). But if that’s what an AM is good at then more power to him."
109,2020-01-31 16:34:54,ewqfp4,"Makes sense, most would rather teach or entertain than get their face punched.  Poverty, low iq is a pro-fighter's stereotype."
110,2020-01-31 14:09:12,ewkbb6,"I don’t think the object of this new wave of Asian-American representation is to add more individuals (actors) to a list that people can point to and say “THIS is the prototypical good Asian-American”, but rather to dispel the idea that Asians are a monolith, which I see as the biggest obstacle in our continued success in film/TV/comedy/beyond. Awkwafina is exciting to me precisely because her career and persona are unexpected and uncomfortable to American audiences, and she does disrupt the stereotypical portrayal of a demure, quiet Asian women with her loud mouth, pot smoking, unemployed, queer character of Nora from Queens. (And there are plenty of Asians who grew up in Queens who speak like her.) It might not make her look like a hero, but it is authentic, and there are so many Asian Americans out there who fit that bill and have never been seen on screen like that otherwise.

I mean, there will definitely be people who see characters like her and have a negative impression. But like any lead TV character, she will be fleshed out and turned into a multifaceted individual with strengths and weaknesses, and American audiences tuning in will be able to take that journey with her and see the extent of her humanity beyond her skin color. On a personal note, growing up I would often get comments from friends that I was “so funny they forgot I was Asian” (not trying to toot my own horn, I am a lot less funny now). But I internalized that and would often act out just in an attempt to get my classmates and teachers to see me as just a fully realized human with flaws, instead of a walking Chinese flag. The expectation as an Asian-American to be smart, proper, and “good” destroyed me as a teenager.

I don’t think every new portrayal is inherently positive; I had some problems with Crazy Rich Asians, for example, but the diversity of those portrayals are a net win in my book, at least for the next few years as Hollywood and America gets more comfortable with the idea of different types of Asians. We’re about to get an Asian Marvel superhero; is that more of what you’re talking about in terms of positive icons?

This is long, and I do see what you’re saying in the way of presenting ourselves in a good light. But I also think we need to take baby steps and time, and support a variety of Asian artists who have unique and differing voices. That is what will break down stereotypes. I don’t think we need to worry that white Americans will all see us as idiot schlubs now because of Awkwafina (or Jason Mendoza on The Good Place, which has been on the air for four years now, just ended). These characters are outliers so far. I’d like to see more of them. We need to plant seeds in every corner."
111,2020-02-01 05:01:54,ewkbb6,I think this is quibbling semantics and/or creating a problem to debate.
112,2020-01-31 15:49:18,ewkbb6,"Looking at any public figure and stereotyping is just what people do.  Representation is kind of an acknowledgement of that.

Maybe I'm being a grammar nazi, but doesn't representation literally mean to stand in place of another?  To serve as a sign or symbol of?

Would you feel it's accurate saying this Actor is our representative?  This Actor represents us?  Isn't that what's being said?  If that's not what we mean, I'm not sure representation is the best way of putting it."
113,2020-01-31 16:13:17,ewkbb6,"I suppose this is just a semantic debate then. No, I wouldn’t say any one actor “represents” , by your definition, ALL of us. That is reductive, and simply impossible — I mean, we are both Asian presumably and can’t even agree on this, so how could a single person speak perfectly for all of us?

I think of representation within film/TV as a sum and a group effort. We can then as viewers extrapolate an individual character’s experience to larger cultural truths that can apply to many within that demographic. It’s fodder for more introspection and critical analysis. For example, I don’t believe T’Challa from Black Panther represents all of black America — he’s not even American — nor of Africa. Captain America doesn’t represent all white American men, because real people are far more complex than fictional characters. But I think Black Panther as a film itself is a good piece of representation because it presents a different schools of thought within the black community in the divide between T’Challa and Killmonger. Even so, there will never be one singular figure or story that will perfectly encapsulate “us”, because we are all just different individuals.

I see what you’re saying but I just think you may be overthinking this. The word “representation” is just a shorthand for, like you said, the presence of more stories and characters that resemble us. Apologies for any typos, I’m writing this on a treadmill lol"

118,2020-01-26 05:17:19,eu1z1j,I'm not a fan of Awkwafina. Won't support her.
119,2020-01-26 05:01:37,eu1z1j,"Not a big fan of Awkwafina, had some mutual friends with her before she became popular and use to do college shows. She was constantly shit on places or parties for being ""too Asian"" despite the fact she was invited by X Asian Students Organization at X college to perform lol. Why take their money then?"
120,2020-01-27 18:35:00,eu1z1j,"I would support awkwafina if it weren’t for the imo valid accusations of appropriating aave. She claims she’s from forest hills and so picked up the accent presumably amongst black friends, but I’m from queens and know the population there is majority white/Jewish and Asian, with few Latino, south Asian, and black people dispersed infrequently."
121,2020-01-26 06:25:44,eu1z1j,">She was constantly shit on places or parties for being ""too Asian"" despite the fact she was invited by X Asian Students Organization at X college to perform lol.

Request for clarification: 

She was constantly *shitting on* her inviters?

Or she was constantly *shit on at* places or parties for being ""too Asian""?"
122,2020-03-07 09:58:20,eu1z1j,"I didn't hear anything about shitting on her inviters, that would be pretty bad given they were basically paying her performance fee. More so the second part shitting on places for being ""too Asian"". I wouldn't be surprised if she felt this way towards inviters as well, especially  X Asian Students Organization. There's usually a show and an after-party at some club. Why even bother going to the party, or even performing at all, if she feel it's ""too Asian""?"

Here's your answer:  Asian-Americans represent 2% of all actors in America, in all arenas of acting, and that's the *highest its ever been*.  Source is the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  And that has far more to do with trends within the Asian community.  The stars have to align for someone to win an Oscar.  When you have a group that is roughly 85% white and 2% Asian, probabilities suggest that the stars will tend to align on a white person.

I really hate this kind of faux progressivism.  The author here is using bad math to justify a presumption of racism, in a form of *conspiracy theory*.  

You could use the exact same logic to prove a ""Jewish conspiracy"" by simply pointing to the *massive* overrepresentation of Jewish actors, actresses, directors and writers in history of the Oscars, and I have seen white supremacists on 4chan do exactly that."

165,2020-03-21 14:14:19,fm9epo,"I like her. Judging by the few clips from her Comedy Central series, she seems to do a pretty job parodying the Chinese-American experience in Flushing without it being too pandering. It has some elements of Broad City, but without it being too self-deprecating. Thoughts?"
166,2020-03-21 14:54:34,fm9epo,"Check out the doc Bad Rap which follows her and three male rappers, including Dumbfoundead. You can see the dichotomy of the situation along gender lines, this before Awkwafina blew up. 

Hard to fully criticize, because although the other guys really talented in their own ways and Dumbfoundead has a loyal long-time following, they might not have the same unique angle that Hollywood is ready for, different from Simu Liu for example. Awkwafina has a unique female persona that fits the trend right now and actually pushes it forward."

Tried to watch the farewell.  But the 1st 15 minutes really bugged me.  I know she's playing an ABC, but that Mandarin...I was like don't you have to practice those lines for hours, why do you sound so bad...unless that wasn't acting and that's her Mandarin.

Caught some of her Nora stuff.  It's pretty good, a raunchy version of Fresh of the Boat.  Some of the jokes don't vibe with me because it's from a chicks point of view.  But seems pretty good."

173,2020-03-21 14:33:06,fm9epo,"If she were an Asian man, I feel probably not- we aren't there yet. Unfortunately, that's an extension of the larger difference in societal perception that exists between Asian men and women in our society currently. Hollywood is both a large creator and a large consumer of the image of acceptability in America (which is part of why it also is a large contributor to the perpetuation of the stereotypes). 

Some of the things the film industry seem to be driven by are visibility, and sexuality. As a woman, this works in her favor in Hollywood, in many ways. It means that she has less distance to cover in the minds of the decision makers there, as far as being acceptable to them (for roles). Being an Asian woman has a different set of stereotypes that being an Asian man has in our society, but one that Hollywood cares a lot about in particular, being attractive. It's easier for an Asian woman to be in that category without as many, or any caveats even, although 'exotic' probably still shows up.

And, for good and bad both, she benefits from the way Hollywood treats women, and how our society stereotypes Asian Women, as compared to Asian men. 

That's all a long winded way of saying that she's getting a similar treatment to how the film industry handles any woman that becomes highly popular. Charlize Theron, Gabriel Union, Kristin Stewart, Scarlett Johannson...the list goes on, have all benefited from the same response. When they got popular, it seemed like they were in everything- it's probably even part of the rationalization that ends up with the whitewashing problem that happens.

Attractive woman gets popular, and it gets roles. That's not 100% of it by any means (I hope!), but it helps. There have been numerous studies over time, that, unsurprisingly, have shown attractive people have an easier time/tend to do better in our society. It's a little unfortunate, but that's how life is, I could argue it's fundamental to the very definitions of beauty and ugliness as tied intrinsically to the ideas of that which is liked, and that which is not. 

Anyway, Asian women have a much easier time falling into that category of 'attractive' then Asian men do (although, not always without some additional stereotyping). And in Hollywood, that matters."
174,2020-03-21 22:22:35,fm9epo,"She was ok in The Farewell, all the praises were overrated, both my wife and I think so. She's just another Asian actor got the right break via CRA and is milking as much as the opportunities coming her way.
All the talk about "" Asian diversity"" is just all fluff and in the end the CRA casts are just about themselves. I would give more attention and credit to asian actors like John Cho who actually will use his platform and speak up honestly and fight about Asian issues."

186,2020-03-21 21:19:47,fm9epo,"Normally I'd hear you on the stereotypes, but the film being based on the personal experience of Lulu Wang (director) makes me think the characters are more true-to-life than just being empty caricatures. Wang talked about her story on [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/585/in-defense-of-ignorance/act-one-7).

 Of course, that doesn't mean the characters can't be stereotypical either I guess. \*shrug\* I think it's hard in Asian American media when the stories people tell have this pressure to be representative of huge cultural issues like immigration/diaspora. So I could kind of see how some of the dialogue in certain seems might come off as stereotypical to someone."

Sure, China is a big market and they know that they can expand their market there with some pandering, but it also just seems to be a part of Feige's plan of diversifying the MCU. Apparently, Chinese audiences aren't even a fan of Simu Liu's casting due to the fact that he's ""American handsome"" and not ""Chinese handsome"".

377,2020-03-01 03:04:26,fbm4qo,Eh. Just pretend it was a dream from ruffalo who nodded off while Tony was talking if you're just gonna be a sensitive lil dude bout it.
378,2020-06-08 14:01:59,fbm4qo,"And I say context matters. If the Mandarin is planning to take over the world in Shang-Chi, he may as well have a good reason for it. 

From what I've read of the 10 Rings, they seem like artifacts powerful enough to conquer a planet (especially when the powers are used in combination with intense focus, as one devoted to martial arts like the Mandarin would be perfect for). Maybe Mandarin is thinking small-scale in his rule at the start of the movie, but once he gets the 10 Rings (assuming he won't already possess them at the start of the movie) it'd be easy for the guy to assume he can control Earth. 

Even if they aren't Infinity Stones, those 10 Rings are still overpowered in comparison to the capabilities of some of Earth's heroes.

One of my biggest problems with Infinity War and Endgame is that we didn't get enough creative use in power, ability, and devastation from the use of the Infinity Stones. Those Stones are the most powerful items in the universe, and I felt they were severely underutilized even with the Snaps and the small instances where we saw a whiff of the potential of those Stones in those movies.

People may argue that the full power of the Stones may make Thanos too OP and surreal/insane for general audiences to witness, but then what is the point of introducing the Infinity Stones in earlier movies if we aren't getting a god-level threat that tests the Avengers, Guardians, and other heroes whether mentally, physically, or through space and time itself. As one example, you could have Thanos accidentally send one of the heroes through an earlier point in history and at a different location from where they were previously with the powers of the Time and Space Stones, with Thanos being unaware of where and when he sent the hero to, as one demonstration of terrifying cosmic fear that the use of the Stones can elicit; I hated Endgame's time travel rules, so it would be more compelling if the hero sent back in time had a chance to change the timeline he witnessed and lived in before Thanos arrives. 

Hell, have Thanos accidentally overshoot the power of all six Stones in anger while being attacked by Thor and end up wiping out all life across the universe. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it could set up the idea that you need complete mental control in order to use the Stones lest you exaggerate the damage and chaos brought about by the Stones. It would have given tension to the audience since the hero sent back in time wouldn't know that Thanos ended up destroying all life, but they would still try to change the timeline regardless so Thanos doesn't even come close to wielding and using the full power of the Stones in the second run of the timeline.

I don't know if they'll emphasize the power of chi and chakra to boost Shang-Chi's capabilities, but at the same time I don't want the 10 Rings to end up being underplayed and barely utilized to its maximum creative directions in combat and displays of power like what happened with the Infinity Stones during IW and Endgame. Even Thanos ripping apart a moon and throwing the debris at the heroes on Titan felt minor and not as devastating as it should've been; though Iron Man got hit by the debris, it's not like we saw the suit take extensive damage from something that would be destructive to even the suit's strong metallic composition. The falling of the debris didn't even clue in to that dumbass of the fact that Thanos is way out of his league, and I get pissed at Tony blaming Steve considering that Steve had a better army and Tony was the one who almost died were it not for Thanos getting some benefit out of sparing Tony's life, but I'm digressing.

So you bet I expect a world-class threat out of the Mandarin and his 10 Rings."

ME wanted to make TV shows through Marvel Television so he had to cede control of some IP in that effort.

I mean fuck, further back in 2010 Marvel Television was even trying to develop a [Hulk TV series!](https://deadline.com/2010/10/abc-developing-incredible-hulk-series-75758/)  Feige had to let go of stuff like Iron Fist as a trade-off to keep their hands off the A-listers."

394,2020-03-01 02:14:08,fbm4qo,Disagree but we're all entitled to our opinions. I'd be boring if we all agreed on everything MCU. I personally love that movie and TIH.
395,2020-06-08 14:31:05,fbm4qo,Honestly context doesn't for me. I think conceptually world domination is a tired trope for villainy. I'm sure it might be a unique presentation but the end result of the same tired trope is there
396,2020-03-01 03:23:46,fbm4qo,Yeah that’s a fair point actually. Given he prefers the cosmic and mystical side of Marvel he probably did want to use Iron Fist.

Some people just get unnecessarily salty, rude, and gatekeepy when some Netflix or TV characters get brought up. It's funny to see a day where people dislike/shit on Iron Fist but are excited for Shang Chi, who I guarantee a majority didn't know or care about until Marvel Studios showed their involvement. We all know who was more popular until Marvel Studios announced Shang Chi. Iron Fist has a less than stellar adaption, everyone should just get over it like we did with the F4 and realize like with F4 there's still potential there.


If Feige came out tommorow and said Iron Fist would be in the sequel a ton of people would be flipping out, it always bugs me when fellow fans downvote/crap on other's expressing their desires."

I honestly think that that was a PR-prepared excuse done as a way of getting ahead of the inevitable ""Why aren't they connected?"" complaints that they knew that they were in for. In reality, it was probably an idea that they talked about for five minutes before trashing it, and it was never seriously considered. If there were concept art done for such a cameo, then this would be a different story, I think."

403,2020-04-12 04:27:07,fbm4qo,">Considering what they have done thus far with Jessica Jones and Daredevil, I don’t see why he wouldn’t trust Netflix

because they could potentially reboot in the future and do their own canon, popular, comic-accurate versions of Luke Cage and Iron Fist with none of the baggage of the Netflix shows?"
404,2020-03-01 02:03:36,fbm4qo,"They were all sold to Netflix at the same time dude. I remember all the articles and video the day it came out. They had the idea to do these 4 heroes then have them come together for the Defenders from the start. Only Punisher was added later. So Daredevil could’ve been complete shit and Netflix still would’ve had Iron Fist to do whatever they wanted with. 

Also Marvel has been feeding us that crap the whole time they pretended the TV side was canon. They always had an excuse though every single time. If they really wanted to fit a character in that bad especially one already established than they would. 

Also I didn’t downvote any link you didn’t even had a link when I saw your comment. What a weird thing to add to your comment."
405,2020-03-01 14:25:29,fbm4qo,While I agree the Netflix shows were probably more out of force from higher ups pushing for television shows I still think Feige had a good bit of say on what heroes he was willing to give for the shows. It doesn’t at all mean he hates the heroes but he still chose to give something like Iron Fist when he could’ve gave say Shang-chi.
406,2020-03-01 13:44:44,fbm4qo,"He was in prison for it, but the Mandarin kidnapped him from there"
407,2020-06-16 17:19:35,fbm4qo,"Yeah well, global/galactic/universal domination is a pretty standard trope in villainous schemes. If you're gonna have a problem with the Mandarin thinking large-scale domination, then I doubt you'll be able to ignore other threatening Marvel villains conceptualizing some form of conquest like Dr. Doom or Magneto (I know the reasons and plans between each of those villains are different, but their end goal is still maximum control over the world if Doom tries to control more than Latveria and if Magneto plans to overthrow the ruling powers with his mutants).

Not every MCU movie going forward has to be an epic globe-trotting adventure and planet-defending war, but going forward with smaller stakes like the MCU Spider-Man movies is gonna feel really disconcerting when we've already had dangerous galactic menaces like Thanos and Ego.

There's no more point worrying over things like the Accords and high school when half of the Earth and the universe was wiped out even if that half came back. 

When larger threats like Galactus and Dormammu (you bet I'll be pissed if they don't allow Dormammu to be appear in his badass flaming body form, even if that form is a fraction of his total power) come to destroy the Earth, you bet I'm gonna expect the heroes to be more than prepared for cosmic threats though I don't doubt that the fight with Galactus is the gonna be the most nightmarish battle this universe will have to face.

Frankly, I'm shocked Peter Parker is acting so dismissive and ignorant of potential galactic dangers during Far From Home. I don't care if you're traumatized Peter, you don't get to hang up your heroic duties because you lost Stark (who, by the way, made things worse and was one of the leading causes to the Decimation) and you feel insignificant.

I'm not saying Peter should get over his shell shock, I'm saying he needs to stop thinking so narrow-minded and start thinking about how he'll better prepare protection for himself, the world, and the universe in case another Thanos drops by. Every person matters, Peter, including yourself. You don't get to quit even if you think other heroes like the Avengers and Mysterio (before the reveal in that film) are better equipped and skilled than you.

At least with upcoming characters like Blade and Moon Knight, they have better excuses to go smaller-scale. With Blade, it's because vampires are a legitimate threat even if they're very covert in their actions and operations on Earth (Deacon Frost's end goal is world domination, but his motivation is primarily about completely turning humanity into meals and subservience to vampires and especially to himself. It doesn't make his scheming any less valid, compelling, and threatening). 

And with Moon Knight, it's because the dude has a fucked-up mind which lends his fractured reasoning better to primarily focusing on vengeance above all else during his introductory story."

409,2020-03-01 14:21:06,fbm4qo,I agree with everything you’ve said. I want Netflix to stay canon and was always a fan of the lack of Defender/Avengers crossover because I liked looking at the Avengers as basically celebrities to the world while Netflix heroes were just the little guy still trying to do right to the best of their abilities. I don’t think they will stay canon for a handful of reasons but I would love it if they did.
410,2020-03-01 02:05:33,fbm4qo,"If they did concept art and such, I would believe that it was part of a draft or something. But they didn't, so I find it hard to believe that there were any serious considerations to use those characters."
411,2020-03-01 02:03:35,fbm4qo,"If the directors said it, I have no reason to called bullshit. It was a passing comment, and they stated they tried and tried various ways but it felt to rushed in an already rushed movie. Seems legit to me. Considering these guys are very passionate about their work I doubt it’s a PR-required statement."
412,2020-03-01 02:41:57,fbm4qo,"Exactly and as far as the no crossover = no canon thing goes, it just tells me they don't read comics or grill them to the same degree they do with the MCU. The comic crossovers and such are always like that, yet if heroes don't show up you don't hear people denouncing their solo runs as non-canon. Even with the behind the scenes stuff the MCU as a whole is more consistent and tied together than most of the comics. How many major events had only the X-Men or Avengers showing up without asking for backup? It's just annoying, yes some of them were less than steller and could have been better but I'll miss the tonal diversity. Marvel Studios would have never made Daredevil the same way, or we still perhaps wouldn't have Daredevil again to this day. I guess it's all about perspective really."
413,2020-03-01 08:30:52,fbm4qo,"I'm sorry but Feigee doesnt need to come out and say anything. He has continuously ignored EVERY SINGLE ONE of the shows except the one he produces.

&#x200B;

There are dozens of events in those shows that could fall in the Avengers attention and they havent even been mentioned. There hasnt even been a line of dialogue. Meanwhile the D+ shows which HE PRODUCES will have a direct effect on films (Wandavision leading to MOM) and characters that are inroduced there will appear in films (Feige has confirmed that Moon Knight, She-Hulk and Kamala will all appear).

&#x200B;

Anyone with half a brain can see what's going on here. Marvel Studios deliberately refuses to acknowledge and canonize he shows."
414,2020-03-04 07:51:31,fbm4qo,"Not sure if I'm one of the fans you mean, but I really like (and in the case of JJ season 1, love) the Netflix shows and the reason I don't like to think of them as 'canon' to the MCU is that I feel they're artistically valid as their own thing, and don't really 'fit' with the MCU's tone or world and I don't want them squeezed into that box. I'm sure they'll be declared alt-universe or something at some point to try and appease everyone, and that's fine. But mostly I just like to think of them as their own thing. 

Same with Runaways, Helstrom, everything else. It's just a different set of DNA."
415,2020-03-01 08:32:23,fbm4qo,"It’s not that people are aggressive about it being not canon, it’s just dumb to assume it is, and gets quite annoying to keep talking about, because the wrong people spout the wrong info. 

If Big Bang theory mentions DC does it make it canon?
If Marvel references Star Wars does it make it canon?

The answer is no. Which is literally all the shows do. They reference the mcu but never get referenced back. If we go by the logic that because they mention stuff from the MCU, then what I just mentioned is canon to the DC and Star Wars. 

It’s quite an simple concept to grasp if you ask me."
416,2020-03-01 02:09:16,fbm4qo,"Here's the thing - trying to logistically include four or five characters from then-ongoing television series into a blockbuster film would have been a recipe for disaster. Even with Disney being hyper-competent in terms of juggling the schedules of their actors. Meanwhile, Netflix would likely have a say in it, and stuff that people like u/SorryEveryoneMyBad have indicated that there were no serious plans to ever include those shows within the context of the movies."
417,2020-03-01 15:37:06,fbm4qo,">People are weirdly aggressive/obsessive about insisting the shows were never canon.

Exhibit A:  Your comment.

People on both sides of the debate understand all of these points by now. 
It's tiresome.  Until Marvel Studios makes an explicit move on TV canon, reboot or continuation, it's pointless to argue."

In previously someone typed Awkwafina as a SN, but idk, i can see why, but she can be  a type of gamine, too.  
But these are only guesses :)"

467,2020-04-07 10:04:46,fwesr2,"yes I do feel like Sarah has a really strong vertical line and I don't see much yin or balance to her....

ooh, I could see an argument for SN but I can also see gamine possibilities for Awkwafina there too, and I quite like her in sharp & broken geometrics... but yeah its all guesses really"

If anything they might appear in the UK at some point given that MI6 is apparently playing a role in this movie, but I don't expect them to appear in the USA. I know Shang-Chi is Chinese-American in the comics but that doesn't need to be true for the movie. Especially given the rumoured Agents of Atlas I feel they might just simply have him living in China (or otherwise being some sort of global nomad).

623,2020-06-25 05:24:46,hf6wyl,"I would start with twice daily and for at least 4 weeks.  It may be a good idea to also loosen up these muscles through self massage with a tennis ball.  Try placing a tennisball in between your shoulder blades and your spine and gently going into the wall with it.  [Short demo of it here.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BhE3JubgX6d/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) You'll be getting more so the middle trap/rhomboid and not as much of the levators but it is all tied together.

Also massage out your [pecs](https://www.instagram.com/p/BhMaAw0goDy/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) too.   I would try both of these before performing the 4 stretches that I recommended.  Let me know how it goes"
624,2020-06-24 19:18:10,heufjt,"None of the things you wrote are wrong. The Asian diaspora is full of identity issues for obvious reasons. No one is denying the things you wrote here.

However, 

1) Too often the blame for these identity issues are often laid upon the current generation of diapora AM.

2) Not often enough do AW try to tackle these problems head on with their AM compatriots. Instead discussion is shut down.

We see both of these point come out clearly in the Yam article. Not only is there no discussion of the role Kellie Chauvin's race played in her marriage to Derek Chauvin, but it also deflects it into yet another case of blaming Asian men. 

What would be ideal would be that the Asian diaspora have an honest discussion of how white worship affects our communities and work together on abolishing these toxic mentalities."
625,2020-06-24 18:30:44,heufjt,"It's somewhat difficult to follow, but if I understand, kmoh74 was arguing that it's weird for current generations of asian diaspora women to project their hangups with their parents onto asian men their own age, who experienced mostly the same of what you are describing.

Your post goes into specifics of that experience, but I'm not understanding how it responds to kmoh's post since these specifics sound like they apply to all diaspora children?"
626,2020-06-24 05:22:58,heufjt,"I’m an Asian-Canadian girl and your point about cross-cultural experiences and being Third Culture Kids definitely applies to me. I prefer Asian-Canadian guys as romantic partners because I tend to connect on a much deeper level since they have that mix of Eastern and Western influences. When it comes to guys of other races or Asian guys that are “fresh off the boat”, it feels like there’s a greater disparity in values and attitudes, and their world view is fundamentally different from mine. Obviously that’s not to say every Asian-Canadian guy I come across shares the same values and views as me but it’s just more likely to find someone who gets the nuances of both cultures in that group and that ends up playing a significant role in compatibility."

Good god, some of these aboriginal people living in the northern part of Australia are literally living in shanty towns, akin to racially segregated towns around civil war times in the U.S. Can't imagine what Aussie Asians go through as well..."
629,2020-06-25 04:28:13,heufjt,"Thanks for sharing your insights as an AF!
Your point about GenX  (and earlier) vs GenY is keenly perceptive- totally agree that everytime I see a WMAF where the girl obviously married for the guy’s money/career (and not his Walmart khaki pants lol) the AF tends to be of an older generation.

Also your point about AFs with mental illnesses  winding up with WMs also rings true to my experiences. I have “rejected”  (for lack of a better word ) and have met AFs that had some serious issues (prob clinical) and yes they wound up with WMs who, with their asian fetish, have overlooked them. Same with how for some WMs the girls don’t even have to speak english lol"
630,2020-06-25 04:01:22,heufjt,">To change deep values; it has to be a conscious effort of questioning why you think the way you do etc; rather than leaving it up to ""osmosis"".

And there is the flaw of Tradition, *especially when handed down to generations with completely different circumstances*.  Tradition seems to assume some degree of constancy in conditions from one generation to the next, which doesn't apply in this fast-changing world of ours, esp. if you grow up in different countries (as immigrants/kids-of-immigrants do).

>I agree that alot of extreme right-wing White guys (with very dark and sick personalities) found this ""glitch"" aka extremely traumatised Asian women (usually someone with a BPD diagnosis) and are purposely attracting young Asians women by making fake promises

Interesting point.  Yes if you see white bro-lit that talks about zeroing in on women that have 'issues' a little like a predator picks up on weaknesses in prey.  Its sad that they exploit Asian women whose issues stem from reconciling their priorities versus their parent's outdated expectations.    Nonetheless, a good insight into what's going on.  Sometimes we oversimplify it here as an AF dating white by 'rebelling' against her Asian family, but this ignored WM predation."

634,2020-06-24 08:35:07,heufjt,"I think this just feels patently untrue for a lot of AM. Hence, the existence of AznId. It makes a ton of sense both rational and emotional that cross cultural Asians would end up in each other’s arms, but we don’t see that really happening as often as it should. Rather, it’s almost the opposite that’s been happening, and that’s why AM have been on a woke spree for the past number of years. 

It could be due to the fact that conventionally pretty AF aren’t high in numbers, but idk about that. Seems like all the “pretty” ones just utilize that as an eject button from their culture, heritage, and society. Of course it doesn’t end well in the long run, but life is hard and most people look for the easy way out."

639,2020-06-24 21:23:54,heufjt,"That does seem to be the trend, and I can only attest to my personal experiences and observations. My perspective may vary from the trend because I live in Asian enclaves in Canada, so for me Asian couples have always been the norm and interracial couples are rare. For example, one of the Asian guys I know pursued several Asian girls in the past and was rejected by them, but they all of them still ended up with Asian guys. And one of my Asian girl friends, despite attending an Ivy League school and becoming a bit of a boba liberal, when she went on first dates with white guys and Asian international students she didn’t really connect with them so she also ended up in a relationship with an American-born Asian. Being in an Asian enclave,  I feel like we are conditioned to be closer to our Asian heritage and distanced from whiteness, so as a result most of us end up in relationships with other Asians."

642,2020-06-25 15:46:05,heufjt,"How we feel on the inside and how society want to perceive us are 2 different things. Unfortunately the older you get regardless of work, social circles etc. (unless you live in an asian enclave) there are some hard choices to be made just so you can fit in a certain mold. BTW, I live in the south, I see it at work all the time for a minority to succeed you have to adhere to white cultural standard, feign to share common interest or pretend their casserole at the office party taste ""great"" when you really couldn't give less of a flip. People's opinions are less malleable the older you are, there's no level of wishful thinking can make you be both Asian and Western without diminishing the value of one as everything and everyone around you is asking you to choose a side. The expectation is monoculture, and that culture has been white since the founding of the U.S. and you can't escape it."

What’s cringe is you think you can cast judgement on what is or isn’t “cringy” without providing reasons why. It implies you think you’re actually cool. Lol"

676,2020-06-04 03:38:06,gw7wiw,"Because in their opinion, that’s what white Americans think how the Chinese should look like and how they tell the Chinese if they’re beautiful or not. people think that when casting an Asian role in their movies, Hollywood only pick certain looks for their own agenda."
677,2020-06-04 03:55:45,gw7wiw,"Sunken eyes, beak noses, and angled jawlines are dominant western traits, but we don't accuse them of self hate or Asian worship when they fix them with make-up or surgery. East Asians generally don't even care much about the west when it comes to beauty standards simply because whites and Asians look way too different to make comparisons. Topics like these tend to circulate between China, Japan, and Korea, and ""Chinese style make-up"" even became a trend in Japan recently with online tutorials and stuff. You can google 今流行りの中国風メイクやってみた if you're interested. White worship? This is really a case of ""I don't even think about you at all"" meme.

Now that brings us to the topic of why the backlash on Asian representation in the west, and there are quite a few complex reasons for why this is happening. One, Asians the west are blissfully ignorant of beauty trends in East Asia, and generally lean towards somewhat dated aesthetics. It's like western society's view of Asians is stuck 30 years behind or something, and people feel the need to point that out. Unfortunately not everyone is capable of communicating their point across eloquently and pass it off with a simple ""she's ugly"".

The truth is... there is a mild case of uncanny valley involved in all this, with all things considered. You have a standard that grows and circulates amongst people in a region that don't really care for anything beyond, but suddenly a person of similar ethnicity, but from a different society, sporting an unusual aestheticity (not a word but just wanted it to rhyme lmao) is brought forth to represent them, it all feels somewhat uncanny.

With Awkwafina as an example, compare the folk in [this picture](https://obs.line-scdn.net/0hz1jtc2oLJR5XDQ1inc9aSW1bJnFkYTYdMzt0AQhjeyouPTEabWNucHRfcyZ9aGJAPmtjcXELPi8pOWQcP2Ju/w644) and in [this picture](http://n.sinaimg.cn/kandian/transform/79/w550h329/20181016/qePf-hmhafir9302241.jpg). I'm pretty sure even if I covered up the words, ANYONE would be able to tell the picture with Asian-Asians from the one with western Asians just from appearance alone. This uncanny-ness doesn't sit well with the native folk, that's all.

Lastly, I can't tell whether you're Asian or not but if you are, please don't fall for that ""Asians are trying to be white"" BS, because likewise one could easily say the same about the opposite if you refer to my first paragraph. Except we don't because we don't need to put down other people's preferences to make ourselves feel good aka, superiority complex."
678,2020-06-04 02:50:33,gw7wiw,"Studies have shown 70% of Chinese people have double eyelids, so it’s not white-worshipping for them to prefer them over monolids. It’s not like more than half of Chinese people have Caucasian eyes. The pale skin beauty ideal also predates European colonialism, due to the timeless association of fairness with the wealthy class who stayed indoors and tans with the peasant class who worked outdoors. They held these beliefs long ago."
679,2020-06-04 05:09:38,gw7wiw,"I don't know if it's discriminatory but rather that Eastern beauty standards greatly differ than western beauty standards.

That's what happen when Hollywood is run by mostly white males. Why the hell would they know what the Chinese population want? They barely acknowledged Asian Americans actors/actress as is. For the longest time, the only roles Asian Americans get are roles that fit into what the non-Asian thinks Asians look like and what they think they care about. 

Hollywood whole trying to cater to China is like trying to pass off Chinese Takeout food as the crowning example of Chinese food.

Pale, thin and clear skin (white powder foundation) has always been a staple of Chinese beauty standard long before Hollywood and before Europe tried to colonize China. It could be a reason that leads to some white worshiping.

Look at western beauty standards and compare that to your average American women. How many of them are tall, slender, not too thin of a lip, and such? 

Why does there need to be a bridge? There isn't a need because that implies that China should conform more to western beauty standards."
680,2020-06-04 02:45:47,gw7wiw,Koreans share the same sentiment as the Chinese with regards to this issue as well . They also feel insulted that the features they find unattractive are overrepresented among Asians in the American entertainment scene when they have no shortage of conventionally attractive celebrities in Korea.
681,2020-06-06 08:03:11,gw7wiw,"Isn't Liu Wen crazy popular in China though?? She always land quite a few top fashion magazine covers each year, in the face of great competition. I just checked that she has 25 million followers on Weibo. Is that considered a lot in China? And to my surprise, Lucy Liu is popular enough to land a Marie Clare cover a few months back!   [(Link: Lucy Liu - Marie Claire Mag)](https://www.gofugyourself.com/lucy-lius-marie-claire-china-spread-is-amazing-03-2020) Apparently she has a cult following for her new show. So never say never! I think China has a market accommodate for a wide range of aesthetics, but just the A-listers seemed to be talked about outside of China.

Aesthetics, language abilities and acting style aside, I always thought there is a certain amount of talent agencies ""gatekeeping"" behind the scene, enough that that it is hard for actors to crossover from China entertainment circles to Hollywood and vice versa. The agencies only make money if you use their actors and local actors can guarantee their box office appeal compared with someone from a foreign market. So it's harder for an Asian American to go to China because they have no connections!  It is also harder for Asian American to crossover because most make their mark in comedies and comedies are always hard to market. For example, Fresh Off the Boat doesn't seem to have made any mark in China at all, they really just don't get situational humor. Side note, what do they think of Constance Wu and Gemma Chan? 

I think Crazy Rich Asian doing poorly in China isn't just about the actors' aesthetics though- there was also  a few months lag in its release in China allowing the movie to be pirated by just about anyone who was interested in watching it. I also read somewhere that the audience in China was offended by the irresponsible ""spending"" by the rich families. To be quite honest, the story was about Asian American culture clashing with Chinese-Singaporean old money culture which is I think would have been difficult to market to audience in China by itself. (No identity with either culture).   Awkwafina's The Farewell bombing might also be about timing: I noticed it was release prior to Chinese New Year and for a movie with such a heavy theme and opening in such a tiny amount of theaters, maybe it just wasn't appealing to audience seeking something more joyous for the holidays? Kind of mean of the reporter to blame it bombing on Awkwafina's looks! Maybe the better approach for Asian America films should be selling it to media platforms to stream rather than have it open in theaters to gain wider audience first?"
682,2020-06-04 13:19:49,gw7wiw,"Here's my theory.  White people don't have a chance with Chinese people who are considered very attractive by other Chinese.

So they learn to go after Chinese people that aren't as attractive.  Less competition for whites to get their attention.

I observed this in Shanghai when I was studying there.  ABC and East Asians that could speak Chinese got swarmed with attention on campus.  Foreigners with less Chinese language skill got way less attention.

So if that foreign classmate came back to the US to become a movie producer.  He might cast Chinese people who looked like people that paid attemtion to him when he was a student...the less attractive ones.

684,2020-06-04 13:31:53,gw7wiw,"I refute the suggestion that  double lids, tall proportions are traditional Asian beauty standards. Fair skin certainly is but too often this is used as a crutch to refute the very real way that Chinese beauty standards have become more Eurocentric/mixed. Look at traditional Chinese art's depictions of women and see how those don't match up to the standard pushed today of Big double lidded eyes and V-shaped face.

 [https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/culture/attachement/jpg/site1/20170308/f8bc126e49161a29ad3c02.jpg](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/culture/attachement/jpg/site1/20170308/f8bc126e49161a29ad3c02.jpg) 

I'm not saying these traits don't exist within native Chinese people but these were not the traditional beauty standards. It's delusional to think that Western exposure and the subsequent century of humiliation didn't influence the way these standards are held today. 

These modern standards aren't straight up white but they are definitely white influence. It's no wonder that rich Chinese woman would be seeking White sperm donors when 'high nose bridge' and 'big eyes' are so promoted.

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/e74jr6/affluent\_single\_chinese\_women\_seek\_sperm\_donors/](https://www.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/e74jr6/affluent_single_chinese_women_seek_sperm_donors/) 

It's spelled out clearly in the article - they want high nose bridges and double eyelids in their future offspring. This is why the 'preference' of this particular Asian beauty standard is so alienating to a large majority of the native population. I'm not saying this doesn't occur naturally with 'pure' East/ South-East Asians, but this standard doesn't represent a majority of the population and IT JUST SO HAPPENS that these beauty standards changed drastically after historical contact with European nations.

Given this beauty standard guess the easiest way an Asian woman with wide set cheekbones, a flat broad nose, monolids and a square jaw can get children with desirable features (v shaped jaw, double eyelids, high nose bridge, flat cheekbones).

Have hapa/Eurasian children with a White guy

From a male perspective having the focus be on high nose bridge, sunken eyes and narrower face is simply counter productive. If you want the beauty standards to be based on a 'poor man's white man' then you get shit like this.

There is seemingly severe cognitive dissonance for how the majority of Chinese/East Asian people look from the native population. Plastering the media with people that have atypical features or had plastic surgery to achieve that look isn't the solution.

There is a huge disparity in the typical looks of Native East Asian celebrities and East Asians successful in strength based sports. 

My personal theory is that narrower face look has less correlation with muscle building genetics.

At some point Hollywood studios have to ask themselves if they should pick actors like Liu Yifei who would be conventionally attractive to the Chinese market.

[It has a good score on Douban](https://movie.douban.com/subject/25885410/), not as high as Friends, Yes Minister, Modern Family etc but still good. Are you Chinese? It's kinda mean to say ""they really don't get situational humor"" when there's Stephen Chow, Michael Hui, Xu Zheng, Wong Jing, or a similar family sitcom called Home with Kids 家有儿女 that's still very popular even if it's a decade old. 

>Side note, what do they think of Constance Wu and Gemma Chan?

They are pretty but their styling and makeup is very Westernized and heavy especially Gemma. Koreans and Chinese like a ""no makeup"" makeup look versus the heavier colors used by Hollywood i think. There are many popular actresses in HK/China from USA Canada Australia UK etc who took part in pageants to act like Fala Chen, Kelly Cheung, Bernice Liu, Grace Chan, Linda Chung, Leanne Li so it's not that Asians in the West are poorly regarded, it's more that they have to go to Asia and act in HK/China productions to be noticed because Hollywood TV and films will never be mainstream in China *where the market of 1.4 billion is bigger than USA+Canada+EU+Australia+NZ combined*. Chinese audiences don't have to get Western films or TV, they have 3000 TV stations (eg CCTV is the main channel but every province has a few like Hunan TV, HK's TVB and ATV, Beijing TV, Shanghai Media Group, Jiangsu TV, Anhui TV etc) with endless content and dramas that compete for viewership on YouTube too. Western film studios don't have to pander to China, Capernaum is a French-Lebanese film about refugees that was a hit in China despite doing average in other countries."
699,2020-06-04 18:27:40,gw7wiw,"Sadly Chinese men don't want to look like roided beefcakes or jocks because it makes you look 笨重 or stupid and clumsy. A streamlined buff look is cool and fashionable in Asia. Chinese dudes prize looking smart/dapper and China's audiences are sophisticated enough to dislike Hollywood for endlessly typecasting Asians like Mike Moh, Ludi Lin, Simu Liu as fighters or comic book heroes (eg Ludi had to play a videogame fighter even when acting in scifi show Black Mirror, why?!). Asian Americans don't realize that Asians do notice Hollywood mostly gives comedian or dumb jock fighter roles to Asians, and Asians aren't really seen as equals in Hollywood until they get lead roles where they can show off their acting chops as a heartthrob, king/queen, anorexic prisoner, dementia stricken grandma,  drug cartel kingpin, kidnapper etc. 

Nobody in Asia cares about watching Asian Americans in jock superhero roles when there are cooler  Asian wuxia/xianxia heroes (see Zhang Ziyi, Takeshi Kaneshiro and Andy Lau in House of Flying Daggers, or Hero, or Crouching Tiger, Park Haeil in War of the Arrows etc).

Most Chinese women don't find those roided athletes attractive compared to hunky actors with a handsome face like [Eddie Peng](https://movie.douban.com/celebrity/1013782/photo/2564565586/#comments), [Shawn Dou](https://movie.douban.com/celebrity/1274225/photo/2493130721/), [Johnny Huang](https://movie.douban.com/celebrity/1354442/photo/2428423362/), [Xu Kaicheng](https://movie.douban.com/celebrity/1337019/photo/2460572288/), [Li Xian](https://movie.douban.com/celebrity/1324619/photo/2327391897/), [Deng Lun]( https://movie.douban.com/photos/photo/2530801028/), [Choi Siwon](https://movie.douban.com/celebrity/1240451/photo/2235435426/), [Rain](https://movie.douban.com/celebrity/1035671/photo/1174758471/) etc (any of the above would attract tons of Chinese if they played a superhero, some are tan or monolided like Simu but taller with better skin and build).

Facial aesthetics are everything in acting. Athletes are cool in a ""Hey he's a sportsman!"" way but neither Yanks or Chinese find the average weightlifter handsome or talented at emoting scenes as a heartbroken lover, poor student, deaf person, soldier, wuxia hero, etc etc. You seem to be convoluting what actors do (emote scenes and read with good diction) and what athletes do (most can't act naturally and sound horrible), even if you think a rugby player is hot, he isn't a professional actor."
700,2020-06-04 17:03:10,gw7wiw,"Have to agree with you on this one.

I used to be one of those people who defended East Asian beauty standards by citing the fact that – contrary to popular beliefs in the West – double eyelids, fair skin, tall noses etc. also occured amongst us, therefore it's okay for native Chinese to like such features.

What changed my mind was realizing how native Asians themselves apply their own beauty standards, and it's exactly as you said. 

They don't just like those features on their own people but on **ANYONE** who has them. And we can all see which groups of people have those traits more **on average**.

This is why even average white men and women can get modelling gigs in China, Korea and Japan, provided they aren't old or obese. Why some native Asians want ""cute mixed babies"". Why street interviews conducted in East Asia yield answers like: ""I like German men/Ukrainian women because they have tall noses and very pale skin"".

**The truth is uncomfortable.** But enough examples clearly show, modern Asian beauty standards are linked to the foreign worship phenomenon in East Asia. There's no need to keep them or not change them when they clearly feed into white/Western worshipping mentalities."

Hence why [Shangchi isn't predicted to do well in China](https://youtu.be/9Blwfh4YPas) (the Chinese comments agree the story is anti-China) or [see Douban](https://movie.douban.com/subject/30394797/) discuss the Fu Manchu yellow peril backstory and casting."

Actors like Hu Ge, Eddie Peng, Takeshi Kaneshiro, Chen Kun, Zhu Yilong, Li Xian, Xiao Zhan have huge female fanbases in China and do not confirm to Caucasian beauty standards at all. If these actors started out in the West would get criticized for being too effeminate but in China they are considered aesthetic looking, hot and appealing without having to look stereotypically muscular like in Hollywood. Compare [Weibo](https://www.hotpot.tv/news/top-weibo-accounts-of-2019-most-popular-celebrities-on-sina-weibo) or Douban followings, Xiao Zhan has 190k Douban followers which is the highest among all celebrities Western or Eastern, male or female.

Hollywood gives all those roles to mainly white actors.

 **Do AsAms get to act in Oscar worthy roles like Jake Gyllenhaal, Daniel Day Lewis, Tom Hanks, Joaquin Phoenix, Di Caprio?

If you still need further explaining why Chinese and Koreans hate stereotypical looking Asians playing typecasted roles in Mortal Kombat, Shangchi, Power Rangers, you don't get it. Asians rather see Hu Ge play a vengeful disabled general (Nirvana in Fire) because there's a ton of depth, plot and better acting skills shown.  They rather see Gong Yoo portray a tired single dad fighting zombies in Train to Busan. They rather watch Ge You (my fave older actor) act as a repentant gambler trying to survive Commie China, or a single man looking for a wife online.  They rather watch Leslie Cheung, Chow Yunfat, Song Kangho in a gangster trilogy. Or Gong Li as a cruel empress, and Zhou Xun act as a female taxi driver. Or Brigette Lin crossdress as a lesbian.

I remember seeing this advert in HK. Hu Ge looks whiter than me and I'm literally Eurasian. (I do think part of this was intentional in the way the picture was taken.)

Simu has the rougher 'peasant' look but Zhang Fei and Guan Yu aren't meant to be played by xiaoxianrou. The Michael Cera comparison is pretty insulting, he's better looking than Wu Jing who has been headlining a lot of blockbusters lately (and I'm glad Wu Jing has been making it big in China).  

You can't say China and Korea don't care about Jawlines and cheekbones and then mention guys like Shawn Dou and Choi Siwon. Li Guangjie would definitely fit that category as well. 

I'm not disagreeing that Awkwafina is pretty plain by any standard.

Funny how the example of female faces are all HK actresses/in TVB, if you want to stay with the HK comparison then how about Andy Lau in Infernal Affairs who has a completely different look to the faces in your male link.  
 [https://kknews.cc/zh-sg/entertainment/v8n2yr2.html](https://kknews.cc/zh-sg/entertainment/v8n2yr2.html)

They have \^Young boyish faces, oval shape from the front and 3/4 profile

By comparison these guys, most of whom you mentioned later don't actually have that look. Exception is Johnny Huang who has that 'poor man's white man' look and looks pretty goofy in a lot of angles.

(Shawn Dou, Choi Siwon and Li Guangjie, Xu KaiCheng - though chin a bit narrow- )

Protruding cheekbones at the 3/4 profile, prominent jawlines. They definitely get a softer more approachable look for their public pictures but those features are definitely there.

It seems more like they can have the more 'Asian' features as long as their eyes are 'big and expressive' enough."

I'm fairer than Hu Ge with double eyelids and a sharp nose but I am full Asian. I hope you aren't an alt of EurasianTiger.

Most Chinese believe Simu Liu, Awkwafina, Lucy Liu, Daniel Dae Kim etc hit it big in USA because there are fewer good-looking Asians in the West (diet, diff beauty standards, bad porno-style makeup) and Western casting directors like exotic Asian faces. Asian casting directors have a different preference to Western casting directors who favour ""strong-jawed Asian muscle men"" because they aren't casting Asian dudes to play characters like Timothee Chalamet's role in The King or Robert Pattison's role in Twilight.

China is a country of 1.4 billion and there are a ton of actors for every role, competition is super fierce. If you want teen actors you have Roy Wang, Jackson Yee, Cai Xukun, Karry Wang. If you want tough bad boys you have Kris Wu, Zhang Yishan, Darren Wang, Li Xian, Wang Kai. If you want pretty boys you have Yang Yang, Jing Boran, Hans Zhang, Dylan Wang, Song Weilong, Lu Han. If you want Wuxia heartthrobs you have Xiao Zhan, Li Gengxin, Wang Yibo, William Chan. If you want everyman heroes you have Zhang Ruoyun, Dong Zijian, Liu Haoran. If you want comedians you have Xu Zheng, Deng Chao, Wang Bao Qiang, Ge You (these guys are all insanely popular more than 小鲜肉). If you want mature 实力派 lead actors you have Liu Ye, Hu Jun, Chen Kun, Lu Yi, Jin Dong, Liao Fan, Wu Xiubo, Chen Daoming. If you want older method actors you have Ni Dahong, Zhang Jiayi, Jiang Wen (terrific director), Li Baotian,Zhang Fengyi. All of them don't look alike, there is such a diverse range of builds, faces, accents, heights, that it's insulting you generalize ""All China actors look like white or prissy"" etc. They fucking don't. Wang Baoqiang was a poor countryside kid with a funny accent who hit it big. Ge You is renowned for his acting and wit. Xu Zheng is China's Stephen Chow, please watch No Man's Land which features a cast of diverse Chinese actors. There's something for everyone. FYI currently the hottest Chinese actor is Xiao Zhan, who inspired huge manic popularity after acting in a BL wuxia novel adaption (well if Johnny Huang, Timmy Xu, Jake Gyllenhaal, Heath Ledger can do it...). His fans called up the CCP govt to ban his fanfics because he's straight which started a big CCP censorship row, and schoolteachers got fired for rallying students to support him by buying his CDs or sending him video chants. I've never seen anything quite like it and the actor and his agency are extremely worried that the government will clamp down on his manic fanbase and deem him a bad influence because he portrayed a gay character. I agree that he's extremely charismatic especially in wuxia, hence Chinese actors' diversity cannot be overstated. I didn't even mention Hongkong actors like Leslie Cheung (who is the #1 fave actor of many Chinese and also did gay roles), Anthony Wong, Tony Leung, Gordon Lam, Ti Lung etc... 

In general Asians find the range of roles in Hollywood too narrow and disappointing, and most Western-born Asians should learn their mother tongue and head to China/Korea/Japan if they really wanna act in better roles. Elvis Han, Kris Wu, Shawn Dou, Eddie Peng, Ludi Lin are good examples. Simu Liu suits the US market and would find it harder to get good roles in China because his off-tone Chinese was noted by Chinese netizens at the official Marvel launch when he said 上棋 and 漫为 instead of 上汽 and 漫威, which was surprising because he was born in China."
715,2020-06-04 20:28:58,gw7wiw,Lmao are you a Korean female? Asian guys like Simu Liu because he looks relatable and not too handsome which makes them feel like average faces can be superheroes too. It's kinda like Sandra Oh and Awkwafina representing AsAm women and Koreans/Chinese complaning they look average but AsAm women saying the men think they're hot.
716,2020-06-04 20:38:15,gw7wiw,"Thanks for articulating your point. Just to reiterate I did list a number of actors and have watched a number of the films you mentioned. I never stated that ""All China actors look like white or prissy"" and gave a list that included Andy Lau, Shawn Dou, Choi Siwon, Li Guangjie and Xu KaiCheng who definitely don't look white or prissy. Jiang Wen in Rogue One definitely had a badass look and I should try to see more Chinese movies.

I hope Simu has been trying to improve his Mandarin during this time, I do agree the pool of diaspora Asian actors is definitely limited compared to their native countries but it's still good when one of them makes it big in the West considering the obstacles they face as an actor. Hollywood definitely is not going out of their way to cast 'strong-jawed' Asian men, The trend has been emasculated eunuchs like Ken Jeong, Matthew Moy etc. 上汽 might not be a role with that much nuance and I certainly get the political implications of the Western Chinese killing his evil yellow peril father and joining the whites from the orginal comics. I hope if Simu has any influence they'll go away from that plot."
717,2020-06-05 08:51:24,gw7wiw,"Simu Liu...  I don't know what his face looks like because I'm too busy staring at his body.

I hope he keeps getting cast in roles that don't require any shirts ♥♥♥"
718,2020-06-05 12:11:10,gw7wiw,"Actors like Steve Yeun, Archie Kao and Harry Shum Jr are famous, hopefully more Asians can get starring or lead roles in TV or films that aren't ""Black"", ""Asian"" or ""White"" by default, like Crazy Rich Asians (it's like an Asian version of My Big Fat Greek Wedding), Kim's Convenience Store or Fresh off the Boat. From an outsider's POV the reason why US race relations suck is because there is a ton of animosity, mistrust and competition between races. Rarely do shows feature a mixed race cast that mimics society more organically without typecasting the Asian to be a nerd or Black to be athletic. USA is weird in that regard.

I don't agree that Ken Jeong, John Cho etc are emasculated eunuchs, they're comedians and it is their shtick. Even in Asia there are tons of comedians like Stephen Chow (self deprecation and gross out humor), Ng Man Tat (Stephen Chow's eternal sidekick), Xu Zheng (bald comedian), Wong Cho Lam (矮仔 comedian whose schtick is self deprecation yet married a beauty queen), Sam Lee (always plays cowards), Ge You, or Choi Wooshik (plays pushovers 호구, acted in a show with that title). Jason Biggs, Rebel Wilson, Mindy Kaling, Amy Schumer, Michael Cera, Steve Carrell etc also portray unflattering stereotypes but it doesn't mean all white people are desperate virgins? North America is a poisoned well, but most people in Asia are able to enjoy a self-deprecating comedian act like a loser or goof off without thinking ""OMG he makes all Asians look bad"". Korean variety shows are full of Ken Jeongs like Kang Hodong, Seo Janghoon (both former big guy athletes who are now comedians), Yu Jaesuk, Lee Sangmin, Lee Soogeun, Kim Youngchul, Kvariety Knowing Brothers is popular because it's a bunch of guys poking fun at their own scandals like bankruptcy, gambling, weight, divorce, inceldom, gay rumors and getting guests to spill their own dirt. 

 Shangchi can succeed outside China but within China the impression is that it's a story about a Westernized Chinese person killing his Asian dad (Douban fans say the plot may change but the roots are still racist) and most Chinese are relieved a Mainland China actor wasn't casted because it is controversial. Chinese people dislike the slanted eyed Fu Manchu racist caricature and assume Marvel picked Simu Liu because of Fu Manchu's image. [He's not attractive by their standards](https://m.douban.com/group/topic/146344651/) and his Mandarin isn't great so it is hard to garner Chinese fans."
719,2020-06-12 02:39:26,gw7wiw,"There have been Asian characters in US media where the Asian wasn't a nerd and was attractive, such as the Asian male characters in tomb raider, walking dead, CRA, or even films like Searching. More and more these days, there is a greater range of diverse roles that Asians are getting in Hollywood. It's still not at the level of Asia's own film industry, of course, but still better than that of any other western nation. Race relations are also good for Asians in the , especially if they're aesthetic and non-fobby.  The issues lie more with the ghetto black communities."

No. I’ve also seen a fair enough of Asians engage in Anti-Blackness. There was also an Asian American officer involved in this case, too. We must take ownership of that. We have experienced racism before COVID-19. But it was being seen as the other, not as a threat. If you learned anything from the racism from COVID-19, you should realize this has been the reality for Black people, Latinx and Muslim people for years with greater intensities."

**YES**"

792,2020-05-29 01:09:41,gs8g2u,"Would watch anything with these two!

That's right I did! Jumanji :The Next Level"
793,2020-05-28 20:59:22,gs8g2u,I’d love a Reddit thread that actually talks about the project and doesn’t obsess over a woman’s stage name that has brought her... (checks notes)... an immense amount of notoriety and success.
794,2020-05-28 23:13:39,gs8g2u,"If you're the Hollywood producer who developed this, please give me back my diary."

796,2020-05-28 22:34:08,gs8g2u,Now is this 'Barry' or 'Other Barry'?
797,2020-05-29 13:54:02,gs8g2u,Is Awkwafina actually any good as an actress? I've only seen her in Oceans 8 and Jumanji and was the clingiest part of those films.
798,2020-05-28 15:38:14,gs8g2u,"I am so invested in this project just by reading the storyline! Also another collaboration of these two actors, count me in!"
799,2020-05-28 20:11:34,gs8g2u,So something written by an SNL cast member meets something else written by another SNL cast member.
800,2020-05-29 12:25:38,gs8g2u,I’ll take awful sounding movies for $500.
801,2020-05-28 21:02:35,gs8g2u,Awkwafina is not funny.
802,2020-05-28 18:31:03,gs8g2u,Awkwafina is fucking hilarious.

805,2020-05-29 09:04:14,gs8g2u,So basically a gender swap of Grosse Pointe Blank ?
806,2020-05-29 09:12:06,gs8g2u,Karen will sure assert some dominance.
807,2020-05-29 12:22:02,gs8g2u,So [**Grosse Point Blank**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJ7AXKWmWOg)? Ok.

809,2020-05-29 13:47:34,gs8g2u,I'll give Awkwafina my life savings to change that stage name
810,2020-05-28 16:15:41,gs8g2u,Wow this sounds fantastic
811,2020-05-28 20:03:08,gs8g2u,TIL that aquafina from bojack is actually based on someone with the name awkwafina
812,2020-05-28 21:34:54,gs8g2u,Cool. I describe it as “contrived” meets “an utter waste of time.”

820,2020-05-29 02:28:58,gs8g2u,So a crappier version of Barry for feminism?
821,2020-05-29 03:15:00,gs8g2u,"copy and pasting Grosse point blanke while making some adjustments to the later act is really just depressing. Happy people remember the film and want to make something similar, but for gods sake, do your own homework and stop copying other peoples"
822,2020-05-29 06:03:48,gs8g2u,Fuck off awkwafina.
823,2020-05-28 16:16:03,gs8g2u,Kinda sounds like grosse point blank with the whole hit man reunites with high school thing.
824,2020-05-28 18:58:44,gs8g2u,Damn the new Jumanji movie seems really dark
825,2020-05-29 01:53:22,gs8g2u,Kind of like central intelligence imo. Little different but the “highschool loser” still turns into “super secret badass agent” and befriends their old highschool bully
826,2020-05-29 15:02:15,gs8g2u,Very Gross Pointe Blank.
827,2020-05-28 19:04:25,gs8g2u,Honestly this sounds so dumb

831,2020-05-29 00:45:21,gs8g2u,What's ligma?
832,2020-05-28 17:03:38,gs8g2u,"Hader and Berg are so involved in Barry, I really doubt someone else could replicate the show."
833,2020-05-28 20:47:57,gs8g2u,"What, you don't think anyone else can pull off a dark comedy? Barry doesn't have a particularly unique tone, it's just really well balanced and executed."
834,2020-05-28 17:08:53,gs8g2u,So over the course of a day a charming sweetheart with ambition befriends a group of jaded and judgemental friends?... Screw it I'd watch that if it came on Netflix
835,2020-05-28 18:15:55,gs8g2u,I'm just now learning that the Bojack character with the most ridiculous name was based on a real person. Wow.
836,2020-05-28 19:16:05,gs8g2u,I have to wonder how much of it is commitment to the stage name and how much of it relates to doubts (given the film industry's history) of someone using the name Nora Lum being able to find much work.....
837,2020-05-28 22:07:25,gs8g2u,This is the name she’s used since her goofy rap videos and so far it’s worked to build her recognition. I have no doubt she will eventually go to her real name when she’s established enough. Think of Dwayne Johnson and how he barely goes by The Rock in movies anymore.
838,2020-05-28 18:29:48,gs8g2u,"The Rock still has to deal with ""The Rock"". It took him years to finally get called ""Dwayne Johnson"". Awkwafina is gonna be around for a while given she was ""recently"" discovered in the Hollywood timeline."
839,2020-05-29 01:20:10,gs8g2u,"Yes! I've always wondered if Pepsi sponsored her choosing the name. Like, did she contact companies, and sell her stage name to the highest bidder?"
840,2020-05-28 22:24:32,gs8g2u,I really wish she was half as funny as casting agents seem to think she is.
841,2020-05-29 00:21:10,gs8g2u,It's a rapper name like Pitbull.
842,2020-05-29 08:54:36,gs8g2u,"I dunno man, we live in a world where rappers are called Juice World, so I personally think Awkwafina is a fine name."
843,2020-05-28 18:00:30,gs8g2u,It sounds like a brand of water
844,2020-05-28 18:18:40,gs8g2u,Tumblr vibes
845,2020-05-28 23:00:55,gs8g2u,Lowest common denominator pitches really interest you huh?
846,2020-05-29 01:52:46,gs8g2u,95% male
847,2020-05-29 00:14:33,gs8g2u,"To be totally truthful, and saying this on Reddit is probably insanely stupid, I just can't get over my prejudice with her stage name. It's unbelievably awful, and I really can't find it within me to care enough to take her seriously.

Tbf, I don't think I've ever commented on this sub before, so I probably don't reflect the sub very well.

Edit: pressed ""add comment"" too early"
848,2020-05-29 02:34:15,gs8g2u,She's pretty good in *Crazy Rich Asians*
849,2020-05-28 19:39:45,gs8g2u,It's such a stupid stage name too.
850,2020-05-28 20:27:49,gs8g2u,"Oddly enough every producer I know says not to pitch your project as ""this meets this.""  It pigeonholes your project and makes it more likely you'll get rejected because the thing you name-dropped isn't on the list of things they're looking to rehash.  Or they don't like that thing as much as you so it loses their interest.  Usually ""this meets this"" is used to appeal to people outside of the industry, to get the audiences of those respective shows interested."
851,2020-05-28 23:32:22,gs8g2u,Stop trying to make fetch happen
852,2020-05-28 21:09:00,gs8g2u,I don't think her stage name did that
853,2020-05-28 17:18:45,gs8g2u,"You might be seeing together more, depending on how Shang Chi plays out."
854,2020-05-29 04:16:01,gs8g2u,IMO she was a highlight of Jumanji: The Next Level.
855,2020-05-29 00:04:14,gs8g2u,*You* don’t find her funny. That doesn’t mean she’s not funny.
856,2020-05-28 23:11:07,gs8g2u,"Agreed 
I find her grating"
857,2020-05-29 06:53:39,gs8g2u,"Other than it stars a female assassin, I'm not sure the comparison makes much sense."
858,2020-05-28 23:39:40,gs8g2u,Hot take and so intelligently put!
859,2020-05-29 06:52:38,gs8g2u,That's the joke.
860,2020-05-28 20:22:28,gs8g2u,"Unless her character was adopted. I have had several students born in China or Korea who were adopted by American couples who ended up with very generic names, or even if they have a Chinese or Korean name, they usually have an “American” first name that’s easier to pronounce from an American’s perspective. Look at Lily Tucker-Pritchett in Modern Family as an example."
861,2020-05-28 23:29:26,gs8g2u,I've got two Korean cousins named Caitlyn [American last name] and Travis [different American last name]. It was a big thing a couple decades ago.
862,2020-05-29 04:47:20,gs8g2u,A lot of Asian people I know have white names as their legal names.
863,2020-05-28 23:56:10,gs8g2u,Yeah and Gillan's character is named Park ... probably the article has mixed it up
864,2020-05-29 06:52:51,gs8g2u,Who said anything about feminism?
865,2020-05-28 17:01:28,gs8g2u,Gross Point Blank should be stolen from more. It was great.
866,2020-05-28 19:13:26,gs8g2u,"So, which Detroit suburb should they set this in?"
867,2020-05-28 18:05:14,gs8g2u,"No this sounds *exactly* like grosse point blank lol. Whatever tho, that’s one of my favorite movies to show ppl for the first time, so good"
868,2020-05-28 19:06:31,gs8g2u,It's like role reversal Grosse Pointe Blank where Minnie Driver becomes the assassin instead
869,2020-05-28 23:08:38,gs8g2u,"Exactly what I thought, except I couldn't remember that name since I constantly get it mixed up with Point Break which I think of as Point Blank."
870,2020-05-29 12:53:02,gs8g2u,Miss john cusack.
871,2020-05-29 02:05:55,gs8g2u,Minus the whole explanation of why she would have any assassination/combat skills aside from GirlPower
872,2020-05-29 11:58:48,gs8g2u,Wasn’t the whole point of Central Intelligence that Kevin Hart was the only nice person to The Rock?
873,2020-05-28 20:55:13,gs8g2u,Really? It’s an original dark comedy that plays with pretty relatable themes to women especially. I miss original comedies. I’ll support the hell out of this.
874,2020-05-28 21:01:43,gs8g2u,So does summaries of Barry. Yet Barry is great.
875,2020-05-28 19:05:52,gs8g2u,What's what
876,2020-05-28 18:40:58,gs8g2u,What's what?
877,2020-05-29 00:48:10,gs8g2u,[deleted]
878,2020-05-28 20:48:26,gs8g2u,"No one said they were trying to replicate the series, people just pitch things as ""*this* meets *this*"""
879,2020-05-28 20:50:08,gs8g2u,But it's also shot incredibly specifically with care and time taken in every moment. No show looks the way barry looks and is as funny as Barry is. It's shot more like a Cohen brothers movie than any other TV show that's on.
880,2020-05-28 21:02:49,gs8g2u,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwzlwyr64pg
881,2020-05-29 11:43:42,gs8g2u,"Same for some silly reason I thought she was based off Christina Aguilera (Xtina) 

Brrap Brrap Pew Pew"
882,2020-05-28 20:24:46,gs8g2u,"I used to work in casting.  Asian actresses are some of the most difficult to get cast, and it's usually white women who are doing the rejection at the producer or client level."
883,2020-05-28 19:55:52,gs8g2u,"I personally don't see anything wrong with the name Nora Lum for an actor, sounds professional. Awkwafina sounds like a cheap Nickelodeon character or something."
884,2020-05-29 00:16:34,gs8g2u,"I just don't get why she doesn't go for just a normal name. Like Nicolas Coppola being Nicolas Cage.

Like, yeah, I get that it's unique, but ""Awkwafina"" just sounds like a talentless YouTuber.

At least, say, ""Zendaya"" sounds like a real name and not some corporate brand."
885,2020-05-29 23:21:47,gs8g2u,I think Nora (Anything) would be taken more seriously than Awkwafina.
886,2020-05-28 23:04:09,gs8g2u,"Agreed, I think her name represents her brand and humor well."
887,2020-05-28 18:33:49,gs8g2u,"While you're probably right about the name following her I think the difference here is that even in his early roles he was credited as Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. She strictly goes by Awkwafina at this point."
888,2020-05-28 22:43:06,gs8g2u,"Don't think it's a case of him ""still having to deal with"". He goes by The Rock on Instagram and Twitter and he has enough clout in Hollywood now to request it not be used in interviews with him yet he doesn't.  The name is still very much part of him."
889,2020-05-28 18:03:58,gs8g2u,"Seriously? It  *is*  a brand of bottled water, that's part of what makes it so bad, that and the intentional misspelling."
890,2020-05-28 20:58:34,gs8g2u,Better than anything Reddit vibes.
891,2020-05-28 23:25:31,gs8g2u,What's your purpose?
892,2020-05-29 01:55:44,gs8g2u,Seems like a sizable part of the sub is with you on the name. I don’t personally get the hate. The name is a complete non-issue/non-factor to me
893,2020-05-28 23:18:47,gs8g2u,"It was her Youtube persona. Just happened to stick to her movie acting. Exactly like The Rock, Except The Rock was a pro wrestler."
894,2020-05-29 00:47:11,gs8g2u,Grool.
895,2020-05-28 23:06:04,gs8g2u,Her name probably was quirky/funny enough to gain some traction back when she was just doing comedy rap.
896,2020-05-28 21:10:25,gs8g2u,Hasn’t hurt.
897,2020-05-29 14:19:23,gs8g2u,"She wouldn't have gotten called into as many rooms to audition if the name on her CV was ""Nora Lum""."
898,2020-05-28 17:29:58,gs8g2u,Right and possibly a third Jumanji film
899,2020-05-29 09:14:09,gs8g2u,Why is that? Were Asian Americans changing their names to sound more typically American?
900,2020-05-29 09:13:26,gs8g2u,Really? I didn't know that. Any idea why?
901,2020-05-29 20:27:03,gs8g2u,"Yeah ghostbusters definitely wasn’t a feminist reboot. Neither was the female joker movie. Neither is this, being pitched the way it is. 

It’ll be exactly as well produced without the kitch, virtue signaling bs the other two died of, because the plot doesn’t reek of rip off a great title under the auspices of girl power. So excited."
902,2020-05-29 12:22:54,gs8g2u,Peak Cusack(s)

905,2020-05-29 12:23:32,gs8g2u,Except it won't have even close to as good a soundtrack.
906,2020-05-29 00:43:35,gs8g2u,">No this sounds exactly like grosse point blank

It really doesn't."
907,2020-05-29 04:12:56,gs8g2u,"I mean why does John Cusack have assassin skills

Is it boy power"
908,2020-05-29 21:35:18,gs8g2u,"I get why you are getting some down votes for something we aren't supposed to say, but John Cusack comes off as a quiet guy capable of being an assassin.  Awkwafina comes off as quirky and fun.  Harder to see her as an assassin.  Uma Thurman can play a killer believably."
909,2020-05-29 12:11:07,gs8g2u,"Yeah, Hart was a super nice guy in that movie."

914,2020-05-28 20:53:46,gs8g2u,"You realize them describing it as “like Barry” is not them saying they’re going exactly for “Barry”, right? It’s a marketing ploy. Giving people a general expectation based on tone. Also, gotta agree with the other guy. You’re being incredibly hyperbolic. Barry is an excellent show. It is not the ONLY show that has or is capable of doing what it does."
915,2020-05-29 02:49:36,gs8g2u,I’m pretty sure Fargo takes the crown there
916,2020-05-28 20:51:03,gs8g2u,I am a huge fan of Barry but that's extremely hyperbolic. I think Fargo does everything you have talked about equally as well if not better than Barry.
917,2020-05-29 00:01:59,gs8g2u,"As an Asian actress who often gets put on hold then hears nothing, this made me so sad."
918,2020-05-29 06:49:50,gs8g2u,"It's a lovely name, but she's built a career as Akwafina. Pivoting now would be hard. Stephanie Germanotta is a lovely name, but Lady Gaga was the name we saw on the Star Is Born posters."
919,2020-05-28 20:03:45,gs8g2u,Execs probably think Nora is too old-sounding on paper
920,2020-05-28 20:07:05,gs8g2u,Sounds like a brand of bottled water.
921,2020-05-29 00:48:06,gs8g2u,"She didn't originally plan to use it for acting. It was a joke name for her rapping, if I recall correctly. And now it's what most people know her by. It can take a while to transition out of it. Like Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson."
922,2020-05-29 01:20:18,gs8g2u,Zendaya’s her real name tho. She just doesn’t use her last name
923,2020-05-29 00:48:09,gs8g2u,I am 99% sure that’s where “Awkwafina” came from. I remember reading that she got her start on YouTube before getting into the acting scene.
924,2020-05-29 02:13:17,gs8g2u,"Um... Zendaya is her real name though.  Seriously, her full name is (okay..) Zendaya Maree Stoermer Coleman"

932,2020-05-29 08:39:24,gs8g2u,It's honestly pathetic people are so hung up on it.

934,2020-05-29 00:04:16,gs8g2u,Yeah and once you have the brand you can’t really just... get rid of it. Maybe she will later in her career but so long as she’s still doing comedy stuff I don’t see the issue people have with it. Y’all love a man named “The Rock”.
935,2020-05-28 21:10:45,gs8g2u,It's still a fucking retarded name

948,2020-05-28 20:55:58,gs8g2u,Setting your expectations that high only leaves room for disappointment. It's not the only show like it but it is a rarity
949,2020-05-28 20:53:00,gs8g2u,I think the second season of Fargo is pretty much perfect but that show isn't as funny as Barry is. It has cute and light hearted moments but Fargo doesn't have anyone like NoHo Hank. Also if be skeptical of another show saying they were going to be just like Fargo that's a tough tone to nail! It's not easy making TV
950,2020-05-29 04:05:29,gs8g2u,"It's probably worse than you think.  I pushed back a few times when an actress who was clearly the better choice got rejected and a few of those women further up the ladder admitted that their motivation was primarily rooted in feeling like men tend to pay ""too much attention"" to Asian women.  Different women literally admitted that the rejection wasn't because of the actress or the role, but because in these women's minds Asian women in general have an unfair advantage when it comes to getting men's attention out in the real world.  It was some of the most petty, nonsensical shit I've ever heard, and I've been in production for 10 years.  I got out of casting shortly after that.  The whole industry is gross but casting is like a weird petri dish of all the worst Hollywood stereotypes."

956,2020-05-29 05:28:40,gs8g2u,Like Beyoncé. Or Wong.

If we were in a group of people and you made your comment about bottled water, half the people would laugh and say ""Seriously?""

It's a comedy, it doesn't really matter.  Hell, unconvincing fight scenes can be funnier than credible ones if handled right."
968,2020-05-29 12:04:04,gs8g2u,Your chain of thought here is extremely misguided.
969,2020-05-30 01:27:11,gs8g2u,Awkwafina was great in The Farewell. No one knows her range because her on-screen experience is fairly limited.

972,2020-05-28 20:57:31,gs8g2u,It’s not setting your expectations high. It’s a descriptor. The film is literally a comedy about a conflicted hit woman. What would you like them to say it’s like? Not the popular comedy show about a conflicted hitman?
973,2020-05-28 20:57:39,gs8g2u,"Yes I agree, anyways my main point is that this *film* just used Barry as a reference point for its pitch. People seem to be taking that very literally. It just basically means the hitman stuff will be taken seriously but there will be comedy throughout."

977,2020-05-28 18:24:09,gs8g2u,There must be a thousand brands of water. I had not heard of one. what kind of people would laugh at that? Glad I don't know you
978,2020-05-28 21:22:04,gs8g2u,You can try and deflect the fact her name is retarded but her name is retarded

This sounds like a you problem.

> Oh and we are ripping off a great show because we can’t come up with something original.

This sounds actually nothing like Barry except for the fact that it has an assassin. Barry is just shorthand for ""comedy with hitman"""
980,2020-05-30 00:03:08,gs8g2u,Grosse Point Blank actually has a damn good fight scene in the high school hallway.

984,2020-05-28 19:07:40,gs8g2u,You may have to be more specific even spell it out that might help
985,2020-05-28 21:34:27,gs8g2u,"Her name was as much of a choice as The Rock's was. The name Awkwafina was her stage name to make comedic raps, it makes total sense within that context and she used it as a stage name in acting because she already had a fanbase.

1004,2020-05-19 06:41:34,gmi85d,"It's crazy that people actually believe a ""plot leak"" from a film that both A) Hasn't finished filming. B) Has no cut done at the moment. 

Even if this was somehow, miraculously, leaked from a finished script, a script/story can be VASTLY changed during production & post-production. I can guaran-fucking-tee you that this leak is not accurate. It's fun fan speculation and theories. But it's not a goddamn ""leak"" just because some anonymous mofo says it is."
1005,2020-05-19 06:00:50,gmi85d,"Some of it sounds like classic Marvel, like weaving the Mandarin and Shang-Chi through the history of the MCU. Other parts sound like straight up fanfic, like how apparently this tournament has Baron Morse, an Asgardian, and potentially introduces both mutants and vampires. That’s pretty heavy-handed with regard to setting up future films, and Feige tends to be slower and more deliberate with these kinds of things. I’m open to being wrong of course, but IMO this is probably fanfic, but fanfic written by someone who actually put some effort into giving this “plot” that trademark MCU flavor instead just 100% wish fulfillment. In this case, it’s only about 40% wish fulfillment."
1006,2020-05-19 06:19:53,gmi85d,"i really hope the Omega Red part is true, kinda crazy if he’s the first mutant we see"
1007,2020-05-19 05:24:19,gmi85d,"This matches up with almost every leak. Even leaks about other shows. 

4chan is hella dubious but I think this might be it, chief."
1008,2020-05-19 12:58:02,gmi85d,"This would fit Marvel's MO of making genre films with Marvel characters, e.g. Thor was high fantasy, First Avenger was a war movie, Ant-Man was a heist film, Homecoming was a teen comedy, Black Panther was a Bond movie, etc. Making a Bloodsport-style martial arts film with Marvel characters would be a very Feige thing to do."
1009,2020-05-19 06:33:24,gmi85d,"I think that people are blowing up how much of the movie is going to be dedicated to the tournament based on that one report from ages ago. It's a clear mix of several **convenient** things based on stuff that's been reported or rumored about in the last few months.

Also, a Mickey Rourke cameo? No way does that happen. He hated *Iron Man 2*."

1013,2020-05-19 14:18:39,gmi85d,"It's 4Chan, so it probably isn't real. 

BUT, if I want anything from this description to be real, it's ""Set during the snap."" I'm dying for stories set during this time, to see the world of the MCU at its most broken. 

Also, I guess if this is true, Mandarin isn't a full blown villain here? At least not yet? Strange choice but could be interesting to see."
1014,2020-05-19 05:21:48,gmi85d,Sounds fucking epic if true

1016,2020-05-19 14:25:24,gmi85d,If this is true and not BS then I guess this is how Marvel is going to introduce the mutants without introducing the X-Men first. They'll just take a mutant that no one knows and sprinkle them in some stand-alone movies here and there.
1017,2020-05-19 15:02:24,gmi85d,SPIRAL? Oh damn shes badass

1021,2020-05-19 16:42:25,gmi85d,I do question how 4chan even got this because unless the person worked on the film how would they know. Though if it they do and it is true then all the cameos sound awesome.
1022,2020-05-19 10:08:41,gmi85d,Wouldn't Omega Red own this tournament? The dude has a literal death field
1023,2020-05-19 14:17:54,gmi85d,"So where did these rings come from so suddenly? None of the ""leaks"" ever address that which I think is a necessary reveal, I mean these things are basically infinity stones and the first time we see them they're the prize in a fighting tournament? Who would just give them away like that? It doesn't make sense."
1024,2020-05-19 15:31:45,gmi85d,"Sounds pretty exciting, but with all these delays this film and all the other mcu projects seem nothing more than a distant dream, hard to get excited."

The various scoopers have also hinted there will be lots of cameos in the tournament. Could be this leaker has incorporated that, I guess, that or there is some authenticity to it. Also, there's no reason why the cameos can't be still subtle. The mutants, Asgardian and vampire don't have to be announced as such, they could be in the background largely, dressed to signify who they are, but invisible to casual fans and without named actors."
1056,2020-05-19 06:21:43,gmi85d,Lots of rumors he's in Falcon and Winter Soldier as well.
1057,2020-05-19 15:15:20,gmi85d,The Mickey Rourke thing has me VERY skeptical. Unless they are using old footage I don't see him coming back. He was very vocal about how much he hated working for Marvel and how they cut so much out of Iron Man 2 it ruined his character.
1058,2020-05-19 06:33:48,gmi85d,"The movie's not done yet, it's doubtful that a plot leak like this gets out before they have an assembly cut."
1059,2020-05-19 11:43:30,gmi85d,I feel like we’d know if George’s St Pierre was on set at least as Batroc
1060,2020-05-19 15:08:13,gmi85d,"Correction, Thor SHOULD have been high fantasy, like in the comics. Instead we got this weird sci-fi magic blend set in outer space. Thor was what the Eternals should have been/probably will be too.

The Thor franchise should have been the MCU's Lord of the Rings."
1061,2020-05-19 06:46:34,gmi85d,Just like Natalie Portman hated Thor 2 and would never come back. Oh wait.
1062,2020-05-19 05:52:06,gmi85d,Which obvious mistakes?
1063,2020-05-19 08:40:44,gmi85d,"Hahaha true true. 

Would be sick tho if Black Knight fought in the tournament."
1064,2020-05-19 10:15:02,gmi85d,I'd say so. Carbonadium tentacles and the ability to leech the life force from others to completely heal yourself is a winning combo
1065,2020-05-19 17:00:26,gmi85d,"I forget the details, but some previous leak claimed the rings are alien tech that have been in the possession of some ancient master who's dying.  He will pass on the rings to the winner of the tournament."
1066,2020-06-06 19:05:17,gmi85d,What do you mean by that?
1067,2020-05-19 13:35:51,gmi85d,"Why? We don't really know what the context for the tournament setup is beyond the ten rings being the prize. Maybe the owner is dying of old age and wants to bestow them on the most worthy warrior. Could be any number of reasons, but the tournament part is one of the more known parts considering Charles Murphy and others have confirmed a casting call for a ring announcer for the film: https://www.murphysmultiverse.com/exclusive-shang-chi-casting-for-ring-announcers-could-support-longstanding-tournament-leak/"
1068,2020-05-19 05:53:08,gmi85d,"That came from the roger wardell clone, so doubtful"
1069,2020-05-19 15:26:37,gmi85d,"What's the point of having any character in any movie? 

He's a cool character they have plans for so they are getting the audience familiar with him. 

If all the leaks about him are true, then I can definitely see him being the first X Men big bad"
1070,2020-05-19 06:26:07,gmi85d,"I mean, we did see him rip the magic out of an innocent guy crippling him. Pretty on brand for a villain"
1071,2020-05-19 12:36:39,gmi85d,"Yeah, but Punisher is pretty much a villain."
1072,2020-05-19 08:39:35,gmi85d,"Agree, and also the format of words in a leak are often different to what happens on screen, in a variety of ways (assuming it is authentic): where this person is getting their info from (script / storyboards which don't give full detail), the person themselves interpreting and writing words which themselves are misinterpreted. Lots of junctures for mistranslations."
1073,2020-05-19 17:13:09,gmi85d,"This is the safest leak I’ve seen, though three things ruin it for me. The mandarins potryal in this leak,Mordo, and omega red/mutants"
1074,2020-05-19 12:24:55,gmi85d,Rise of Skywalker was on r/StarWarsLeaks first before 4chan

Seen the movie, have you?"
1076,2020-05-19 09:52:37,gmi85d,"I think it was worth sharing, thanks"
1077,2020-05-19 06:54:10,gmi85d,"There's a handful of times when the leaks are accurate, but it's easy to tell when they are legit, in my opinion. The hundreds/THOSUANDS of fake leaks, on the other hand, are pretty easy to spot. This screams ""fake"" to me."
1078,2020-05-19 18:39:32,gmi85d,"I don't think this one really adds up. They don't say why Shang Chi even fights the Mandarin at the end, he just accidentally summons Fin Fang Foom and then his son turns on him.

I think that a common thread in fake leaks is that they always have a fleshed out beginning and middle to the film, but skip through the end because that's the hardest part for them to make up a satisfying plot for. It's easy to set up your idea of a dream movie. Personally I come to this sub for small leaks and to tear down fan fiction because it's fun to read but also fun to disprove."
1079,2020-05-19 06:56:43,gmi85d,"Nowhere did I say I want this to be fake, moron. I want this plot to be real, probably more than you. But I'm also smart enough to spot the difference between a legit leak, and a fake one, which seems to be something that A LOT of people on this sub have failed to learn, and I'm not going to waste my time teaching. You can choose to believe a fake leak if you want. I, on the other hand, will wait for a legit leak before I get excited."

1081,2020-05-19 14:10:30,gmi85d,">we will see them slowly enter

And by slowly enter, you mean just mere name drops, allusions & references to mutants, as well as tiny walk-on cameos by  a few mutants in early phase 4 films?"
1082,2020-05-19 08:35:12,gmi85d,I agree. If there is a giant fighting tournament there will 1000000% be a bunch of cameos and setups. It’s such a perfect concept
1083,2020-05-19 08:35:32,gmi85d,I agree. If their is a giant fighting tournament there will 1000000% be a bunch of cameos and setups. It’s such a perfect concept
1084,2020-05-19 06:41:41,gmi85d,"It sounds like this piggybacked off of those rumors, as there is a lot of piggybacking going on here. Notice how nobody said that this was set between AIW and AE until recently, when we got a visual hint from the set suggesting that it might be?"
1085,2020-05-19 06:25:00,gmi85d,seems like such an out-there character to introduce in what seems like a pretty lowkey show but im hype nonetheless
1086,2020-05-19 15:21:35,gmi85d,"Well the thing is, he hated how the studio changed the movie. But the Creative Committee is gone and Feige could have definitely done some bridge mending. 

But you're probably right that it's just old unused footage from Iron Man 2."
1087,2020-05-19 06:35:38,gmi85d,Could definitely be based on an early script or even the shooting script
1088,2020-05-19 16:17:21,gmi85d,"I think ""Thor"" itself pretty much stuck to the high fantasy tropes. ""The Dark World"" did to start but wandered off towards the end, largely I think in service of the broader MCU's needs. 

Ragnorak went off the rails. I'm not complaining about that, because I love that movie, but yeah, the Thor franchise ain't fantasy any more. Eternals could be, though. 

Which isn't to say franchises have to stay in one place. Cap went from a war movie to a conspiracy thriller to his own thing. The important point is that Marvel doesn't like to make superhero movies: it likes to make MOVIES that just happen to have Marvel's characters in them. I dunno if this particular leak is or isn't bullshit, but it does fit Marvel's pattern, fwiw."
1089,2020-05-19 15:11:28,gmi85d,And it only took 9 years and a big paycheck and woman Thor!
1090,2020-05-19 06:49:24,gmi85d,"The difference is that she's getting a larger part and something that she wants to do, instead of being sidelined. Rourke would have no reason to change his mind."
1091,2020-05-19 07:29:39,gmi85d,"Portman hated Thor 2 because of the way which Perlmutter handled the project, getting rid of Patty Jenkins are director and giving Jane Foster nothing to do with general old man sexism that is the entire reason feige threatened to quit."
1092,2020-05-19 12:39:39,gmi85d,Asgardian Dane is the big one.
1093,2020-05-19 10:18:35,gmi85d,There's also that rumor of him appearing in falcon and ws. I hope he's not getting weakened? He's a scary dude who I hope takes on the X-Men team when they're introduced.
1094,2020-05-19 13:38:17,gmi85d,"I’m not doubting it’s inclusion in the film, I just think story wise it could play out as lazy writing"
1095,2020-05-19 05:55:43,gmi85d,Don't listen to this guy anyway. He's delusional and insists he has knowledge he doesn't have. Him supporting this post makes it even more dubious
1096,2020-05-19 15:55:11,gmi85d,"You got a point. 

I could understand Kwannon or Matsuo Tsurayaba but it just seems random."
1097,2020-05-19 06:58:37,gmi85d,"It doesn’t need to be black or white. Widow was an Assassin, and there are a few other alignment swaps. Mordo could tone down the villainy or come to regret that eventually. Or maybe he’s crazy and a wild card. I just don’t want him to be reduced to just another villain when he kinda has a point.

Fucking around with time and reality will only make everything more complicated. Kang is heavily rumored to show up. A rouge Loki is on the loose, and I’m sure we’ll see Dormamu again and maybe Mephisto. 

Mordo followed a strict set of laws, which a new guy who was kinda an asshole comes along and becomes his masters favorite student. Then he calls her out for being hypocritical, she dies, and he breaks time to reverse their defeat as reality is consumed in the very darkness that gave her power.

Mordo has every right to be like “okay on second thought this magic shit isn’t working out” lmao"
1098,2020-05-19 17:50:56,gmi85d,"EXACTLY.  People treat him as a hero, but fuck dude, Frank Castle is fucked in the head."
1099,2020-05-19 17:13:52,gmi85d,"There are misspellings cause I did

1100,2020-05-19 09:26:26,gmi85d,"To be fair, if you saw ""somehow Palpatine has returned"" in a script leak, would you think it'd be legit?"
1101,2020-05-19 08:37:48,gmi85d,"Why can’t people come here and be hopeful that some leaks are right even when it’s fake. Literally the worst case scenario in believing in a fake leak, is that it’s wrong and marvel blows your mind in another way. 

Don’t be so negative, people love to speculate."
1102,2020-05-19 17:52:03,gmi85d,"Yes kinda, at most we get to see 1 or 2 but nothing more than that."
1103,2020-05-20 02:47:00,gmi85d,Seems about Feige.
1104,2020-05-19 08:58:55,gmi85d,"Your math and spelling disturb me but other than that, I wholeheartedly agree. It would be the absolute best way to introduce all those types of characters."
1105,2020-05-19 06:43:22,gmi85d,"He was rumored to be in Shang-Chi before he was ever rumored to be in Falcon and Winter Soldier. 

If anything it's the opposite form of piggybacking."
1106,2020-05-19 06:36:43,gmi85d,If leaks are true it seems like they plan for him to be the first big reoccurring mutant threat
1107,2020-05-19 06:40:34,gmi85d,"Rarely does that happen. I think it's hard to believe that this guy knows about specific characters that cameo, but not about who plays any of them."
1108,2020-05-19 15:10:05,gmi85d,Then they would say character names...
1109,2020-05-19 07:28:45,gmi85d,"Why not? They got Robert Redford back from his retirement (albeit he was probably contractually obligated, we don’t know that for certain), but I think it’s not that hard to imagine that he would return for a cameo. If I remember correctly, even actors like Hugo Weaving or Christopher Eccleston sorta backpedaled regarding their previous statements about “hating” working with Marvel."
1110,2020-05-19 18:40:11,gmi85d,"Assuming these leaks are true, it sounds like he's being set up to be the villain of whatever X-Men movie we're getting. Just as MCU Spider-Man has avoided villains that have already appeared on screen before, I bet you we aren't getting Magneto for a while (or if we do, he'll be an overarching threat in the background rather than fighting the heroes directly)."
1111,2020-05-19 07:10:20,gmi85d,"Mordo has always been one of those characters that has walked the line but ultimately he is there to be the challenge to strange. He is the mirror to strange to show how things can be when twisted and distorted from the original. I like him better as someone working in villainous ways in the background, cutting down on magic (wrecklessly) in the world with the ultimate goal of ridding the world of the biggest user of magic the sorcerer supreme."
1112,2020-05-19 13:56:30,gmi85d,"Rouge Loki is just regular Loki, but fabulous and wearing lipstick."
1113,2020-05-19 19:11:46,gmi85d,But does he kill innocent people?
1114,2020-05-19 18:14:21,gmi85d,Probably because at the time of those leaks we knew he was coming back from the teaser😂
1115,2020-05-22 16:51:49,gmi85d,"to be fair, that whole movie's script was written with the same skill as a random redditer imagining the plot ha ha...haa...."
1116,2020-05-19 20:56:17,gmi85d,"Yeah, like they did with Dr Strange in TWS. 

For example, Professor Xavier might be a notable philanthropist/professor already. Telepathy is rather easy to hide, after all"
1117,2020-05-19 08:59:39,gmi85d,Hahaha sorry man I’m way too tired
1118,2020-05-19 15:09:49,gmi85d,You're being downvoted but you're 100% right. Omega Red was rumored to be in Shang-Chi long before any word of Falcon popped up
1119,2020-05-19 15:16:32,gmi85d,"That would make sense. Marvel might want to do what there doing with Spider-Man, using X-Men villains we haven't seen before first"
1120,2020-05-19 06:45:23,gmi85d,"If he/she only knew the script, they'd know nothing of casting."
1121,2020-05-19 15:13:49,gmi85d,They did...
1122,2020-05-19 08:09:03,gmi85d,"> They got Robert Redford back from his retirement

This is a misconception. The scene that they shot with him was only for a single day, and it was his last day of acting. The film just released after he announced his retirement.

Also, I don't think that he's ever spoken badly about his time at Marvel Studios, whereas Mickey Rourke has.

EDIT: Why the downvotes?"
1123,2020-05-19 23:36:25,gmi85d,His lewks slay and yeah basically a Jojo character
1124,2020-05-19 19:51:11,gmi85d,"As much as I love Castle and his show, killing people without letting them go on trial is kinda the point of him being not a hero. Sure, they're not innocent, but how many henchmen did he kill who were just doing it for a check to feed their families? Did all of them deserve a bullet to the head?"
1125,2020-05-19 09:28:00,gmi85d,"Some people just don't like being proved wrong, even when they're met with straight facts."
1126,2020-05-19 21:11:29,gmi85d,"And further more, there's a judicial system for a reason."
1127,2020-05-28 23:05:13,gmi85d,"Funny enough, he becomes a galactic level ghostrider. Cosmic Ghostrider was even part of one half of the Guardians of the Galaxy for a bit till he went on his own.

1134,2020-05-11 05:38:28,gh3uzq,"I read a few of the original comics but was not an avid reader.  Shang-Chi had a romance with a female, which, how can I say this, was really unfaithful."
1135,2020-05-11 12:58:22,gh3uzq,"Don't mind that much. I'm pretty jaded with these Marvel movies, tho Shang Chi might be a breathe of fresh air just by his very nature. That is if they stay true to the comics, Bond-esque spy themes, dark edgy noir, and 70s-style fight scenes."
1136,2020-05-10 16:39:02,gh3uzq,"I'm more interested in whether or not she's actually a good love interest. Also, do most people regardless of race legitimately find her hot?"
1137,2020-05-11 02:21:54,gh3uzq,"Exactly, that's what I'm saying."
1138,2020-05-11 05:50:44,gh3uzq,"Although they may not admit it, there are some people on this sub that secretly wish this film could have AMWF instead, because AMAF is simply playing defense and reiterating the status quo, whereas AMWF delves into more uncharted territory and upends the status quo."
1139,2020-05-10 16:26:42,gh3uzq,Do you think these alleged leaks about things like her being the love interest are accurate or not?
1140,2020-05-11 04:09:52,gh3uzq,Chinese audience can accept Liu Simu after getting to know him better since he is really not on the ugly side aethestically but I highly doubt they would ever accept Aquafina.
1141,2020-05-10 21:23:20,gh3uzq,"Lol fair point, we wonder why Hollywood didn't have the foresight to cast Asian actors who would be considered good-looking by Chinese audiences, knowing that mainland China could potentially be a huge market for the film. It's not like there aren't any diaspora Asian actors who fit the beauty standards in China, like Ludi Lin and Karen Fukuhara would have been better choices. 

It seems like Chinese beauty standards regarding Asians is backwards-compatible with Western expectations of Asian beauty. Like actors who would be considered attractive in China would also be considered attractive in the West, but some Asian actors who are viewed as attractive in the West wouldn't necessarily be attractive in China. To be fair, we're not even sure if Hollywood execs find Simu and Awkwafina to be attractive, maybe they were casted for reasons other than their looks."
1142,2020-05-10 19:30:15,gh3uzq,"Out of the loop, how is she anti-Asian?"
1143,2020-05-11 02:43:36,gh3uzq,"Ehh we dunno, if you look at the white actors who play other Marvel characters, most of them are above average in looks and have a good amount of charisma on top of it. Sure, there are some average looking ones like Tom Holland or Paul Rudd, but they are more than balanced out by the aesthetic ones. When it comes to Asian actors, there aren't many to begin with, so for the few that do get cast, it's extra important that they are above average looking in order to provide good representation, especially since it could influence how well the film does in the Chinese market."
1144,2020-05-11 04:14:21,gh3uzq,"Seth Rogen is the perfect example. You would not expect him to be the Thor no matter how much charisma he has, right?"
1145,2020-05-11 07:59:33,gh3uzq,"Oh my god, just stop with the narrative about The Farewell being a great movie..... dam man AM will never get the respect they deserve if we keep putting these WMAF into the spot light. I pray that she doesent get the role, because we need a win here guys and Awakafina is not it. Charisma or not. Her New Orlean show is pretty okay though!"
1146,2020-05-10 18:23:03,gh3uzq,"> do most people regardless of race legitimately find her hot?

NO, she's so plain 'jane'."
1147,2020-05-10 20:35:10,gh3uzq,she's kinda ugly 🤩
1148,2020-05-11 08:01:17,gh3uzq,Nothing wrong with that wish. It’s about time some one got the balls to fight for AM’s. I don’t even mind if they cast the side kick as a WM with a AF love interest if that’s the case!
1149,2020-05-12 02:02:20,gh3uzq,Best case scenario is he bangs a WF and gets into a relationship with an AF.
1150,2020-05-10 16:34:23,gh3uzq,Must be. She’s one of the two leading actors in that movie and she’s for sure the love interest.
1151,2020-05-11 04:13:05,gh3uzq,"Nah, they consider him to be ugly. There was backlash when his casting was announced. He doesn’t meet their beauty standards."
1152,2020-05-11 04:11:18,gh3uzq,Yifei Liu from Mulan can also work. Bingbing Li also stared in Resident evil movie before.

He would become heartthrob on chinese TV shows if he is able to take part in. Chinese definitely don't like the looks of Aquafina though."
1159,2020-05-11 04:43:57,gh3uzq,Damn. Tbh I found her off putting when I saw her for the very first time in CRA without knowing who she was at the time because she was so try hard. This reinforces that image lol.
1160,2020-05-12 00:31:46,gh3uzq,"The amount of shitty AM representation of based on stereotypes. Who the fuck fakes a marriage just to hide a lie? That’s unbelievable, the chan-like cousin from Japan what was that suppose to add to the story? Oh here we go another story about a middle aged Asian lady and her pursuit of the arts who happens to be single so she will face the inevitable remarks of ‘When are you going to get married blah blah’. Such a free spirit. That doctor scene omg, how thirsty did they want the AM to be, lol! 

My question will be, if we change the gender of the characters portrayed like swap out awkafina for a dude would the film still get its ravishing reviews? Probably not. This is an American film that once again fails to deliver for Asian Americans.

Thumbs up to the cast it’s not a bad movie by any stretch BUT no way is it above average."

There were many negative comments regarding his looks as well. People on this sub were even criticizing Chinese people for it back then because Simu is an important figure to them.

So even though there is backlash over his appearance, once the promotion comes in, Chinese audience will accept him eventually. Can't say the same about Aquafina."

I've been wearing the same clothes, haven't showered, haven't brushed my teeth, and mostly been eating junk. Sorry for being so personal, but that's pretty much what this news has to come to. 

Someone on /r/movies linked to this thread and I felt compelled to say something to you. Please, please do not harm yourself in any way. 

You can feel better, even if this SpongeBob movie never gets released into theaters. And one day (after the COVID-19 pandemic is over) there may be another SpongeBob movie in theaters, or many more. Who knows? Plus, VOD is still a very nice option and many great movies are appearing on VOD these days. 

Please talk to your family about how you are feeling and/or consult with a therapist. I sincerely hope you feel better soon. Please stay strong."

1177,2020-06-28 20:19:28,hh5ilx,"Many great movies, including award contenders, have appeared on VOD and will continue to appear on VOD. Due to the pandemic a lot of films are being released on VOD even though they had originally planned theatrical releases. And even before the pandemic, VOD was a source of many interesting and great movies, and it will continue to be a good service.

Besides, the value of art shouldn't be tied to how it is delivered to an audience. That's just the delivery context. The delivery context says nothing about the actual quality or importance of a movie. You (and other viewers, fans, critics) can decide the value of a movie in subjective terms. For example, I personally remember enjoying THE RETURN OF JAFAR when I was much younger, and that was a direct-to-video release. Similarly, I've noticed people have good things to say about one or more of the direct-to-video LION KING sequels.

Since there's a pandemic happening, VOD is the only option for many movies but that doesn't mean that a VOD movie is any less of a movie.

HBOMax's upcoming schedule must be jam packed until the end of the year that they can't fit them in or they need to space out how they roll out new shows not knowing when filming on new projects will resume."
1207,2020-08-14 06:50:33,i93vb6,"ViacomCBS does have CBS All Access however like I noted in a previous thread ViacomCBS' streaming strategy is very different from what Disney, WarnerMedia & NBCUniversal are doing. 

ViacomCBS needs to generate more cash flow and is not in a position to limit its content to its own platforms. They are licensing things left and right in either exclusive or non-exclusive deals. 

A lot of the Viacom content added to CBS All Access can be found on other streaming services like Hulu, Prime Video and Tubi (one of PlutoTV's competitors.) Netflix will soon get some content already on CBS All Access like *Everybody Hates Chris* and *The Game.*

Peacock has a wide encompassing non-exclusive deal with ViacomCBS which is why Showtime Original Series like *The Affair* and *Ray Donovan* are on Peacock's Premium tiers. 

ViacomCBS are still packing Paramount movies and selling them to other streamers like  HBO Max, Peacock, Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, etc.

The head of Paramount Pictures even said in September 2019 that they are open to let premium services bid on the Pay 1 Window for their films once Epix's deal is done instead of just giving that window back to Showtime."

I haven't seen the film, so I apologize for derailing the thread, but this is a pretty bizarre framing isn't it? The nuclear family exists in the West for *almost everyone*, with pretty much the only exception being people who lack one or two parents, I'd say that counts as pretty mainstream support. Abstinence-only or creationism are things mostly supported by conservative religious people. The nuclear family? That's probably the most mainstream opinion you can get, next to ""murder should be illegal"". The only other opinions I've heard is a sort of commune-raising which only my absolutely most super-communist friends have touted as some lofty ""maybe in the future"" idea, and I've not heard anyone suggest a return to having grandparents and cousins all live in the same house, though of course there's some thought to a decreasing bond families have to their grand parents."
1239,2020-08-10 19:11:48,i78v7i,"> With all the Black Lives Matter, socialism vs capitalism discussions going on, I can't think of a more beautiful & timely film that explores both sides of this with compassion. 

I loved The Farewell, but I don't understand what it has to do with BLM vs., uh, anti-BLM? or capitalism vs. socialism. I especially don't know what you mean when you say it ""explores **both sides** of this with compassion [emphasis mine]."" Could you clarify what you mean?"
1240,2020-08-10 22:14:33,i78v7i,"I really liked this movie, as much as it was a story about family it was also a story about the relationship between China and America. Billi (played by Awkwafina) is our protagonist who represents the liminal immi/emigrant who is kind of caught between the worlds of her extended and immidiate families, and the worlds of her two countries.

For example, she is stuck in the middle of debates within her family at the dinner table about which country is better. It  centres around piano lessons and schools (she concedes she does not keep up with the piano just as her aunt concedes her cousin would probably still go to school in the US). Or she is stuck at a literal doorway in awkward small talk with a hotel employee about which country she thinks is better. She only commits to saying they are different. She speaks Chinese (sorry, I can't remember which specific language), but not as well as her family in China. She argues with her mother and expresses how hard and confusing it was for her to be stuck in America when a family member passed away. Billi is culturally stuck between two places, and so her decision about how to deal with her grandmother is also stuck within the family unit.

I also liked how time was a character in this movie. The changing neighborhoods of China as they pass where places used to be, the wedding party is welcomed by employees who's style of welcome feels antiquated, the time it takes for cancer to spread and emotions to bubble up (as seen during the wedding). 

I have never been to China but this movie really felt like it captured a side we don't typically see in movies. Thoughts?"
1241,2020-08-10 19:46:51,i78v7i,"Not really, pretty much only middle class and up whites really do the whole Nuclear family completely.  In many cases Hispanic, Asian, black, middle eastern, and even poor white families still do not.   And even among whites it depends on where you live.  Grow up in small town Midwest is going to be less nuclear than living in suburbia. 

But yeah if you want to look at middle class and better off whites as being everyone then you are absolutely right."
1242,2020-08-10 19:28:12,i78v7i,"So a lot of folks these past few months have been saying they can't support the BLM organization because in their [mission statement](https://blacklivesmatter.com/what-we-believe/) it says they seek to ""disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement by supporting each other as extended families and “villages” that collectively care for one another.""

I think what those folks don't realize is that the nuclear family structure is such an anomaly from a historical perspective.

I really like that the Farewell explores the pros and cons of both the nuclear family model (USA) and the extended family model (China), particularly how both models lead to different types of intimacy, and different types of alienation.    This gets unpacked a bit more in that link in the original post: [The Farewell: The Myth of the Nuclear Family](https://youtu.be/vPTD1icP1Kw)"

1244,2020-08-10 20:30:26,i78v7i,">Not really, pretty much only middle class and up whites really do the whole Nuclear family completely.

That's not true, also you seem to be of the impression that America is the world, in Europe the nuclear family is very standard. Of course some people live alone and some people have grandma living in her old age (though that's *very* rare). Immigrant families tend to be much closer with their cousins and grandparents, but it's still quite unusual to live together in the same house.

Also, the criticism of the nuclear family doesn't come from people wanting single mother household anyway, so what's the point anyway? And having a two parent - two children household with grandma in the house isn't as big a deviation from the nuclear family as you might think. I don't think nonwhites in the US raise their kids in an anarchist commune, do they?"
1245,2020-08-10 23:10:42,i78v7i,">I think what those folks don't realize is that the nuclear family structure is such an anomaly from a historical perspective.

so what you're trying to say is that its actually quite a progressive idea."
1246,2020-08-10 23:25:58,i78v7i,"I’m fine with it being a progressive idea, or even a good idea, lol. But it definitely irks me to no end to claim it is a conservative or sacred idea."
1247,2020-08-11 00:20:26,i78v7i,">But it definitely irks me to no end to claim it is a conservative or sacred idea.

I can agree with that, but I think the way this argument has been framed using the movie as an example (the western ""Nuclear Family"" vs the eastern extended family) is something of a false dichotomy.

they're both ideologies that more or less come down to family members being responsible for taking care of each other, and whether that's mostly parents looking after children in the nuclear sense or whether there are grandparents and cousins involved in more of an eastern sense - they're really not that different fundamentally.

the real alternative - which I would argue is anti-human and anit-diversity (probably save that debate for another day) - is the state moving in as the primary caregiver. This transition of course has been underway for decades in most western countries, and we're kind of entering a critical point with the social and economic devastation we're witnessing right now.

so yes, I too would be wary of distracting debates about whether getting grandma to look after the kids while mum and dad are working two jobs each is damaging to the so-called sacred idea of the nuclear family, and be more worried about the on-going economic heist and option C being slipped in while no-one is paying attention."
1248,2020-08-10 23:37:40,i78qqu,"> However, it is interesting that the nuclear family has really only been around for about 100 years now.

this just isn't true"
1249,2020-08-11 03:13:51,i78qqu,"I don’t want to get involved in the arguments about the history of the nuclear family.

I just want to say this movie is incredible. I saw it last year and it really stuck with me. I think about it a lot. It’s just really beautiful and unique, skillfully directed and offering insight into a culture I’m not very familiar with. And it has a strong atmosphere that you can just get absorbed into, something I really look for.

If the trailer or premise interests you, absolutely watch it."

This is a pretty flawed premise. Conservative Christians are not the primary group saying that two parents should raise children together. Nor does a nuclear family exclude extended family relationships."
1251,2020-08-11 01:48:30,i78qqu,"Wait, the grandma gets terminal cancer and only the family knows and not her? The fuck?

I also have to agree with everyone else saying you’re wrong."
1252,2020-08-10 23:39:47,i78qqu,"So there are ""simple households"" that have existed in Britain as far back as the 1300s, but they existed against the backdrop of feudalism, with at least some sort of social safety net available.

Btw, you have a few cards about the painter  [Thomas Hart Benton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hart_Benton_(painter)), but I think in one instance you got him confused with a politician from 100 years prior, [Thomas Hart Benton](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hart_Benton_(politician), which is understandable because they have the same full name and are from the same state! Specifically one of your cards references the painter as representing Missouri in the national statuary, which isn't true - it's the Senator (though he's getting replaced because Manifest Destiny isn't as cool as it used to be)."

The Frouds ascribing gender may just be a way to easily describe them for us humans, as pronouns are an inherent part of our (especially us old people) language. Just because we see The Ornamentalist as ""she"" doesn't mean she does. If that makes sense.

Though I am surprised that they view The Collector as clearly a ""he"".

Either way good find! Thanks for bringing this to us!"

1343,2020-07-12 23:56:47,hprnt6,I believe when they were created they all used male pronouns for the Skeksis but later started using she/her for the ornamentalist for some diversity.
1344,2020-07-12 23:28:16,hprnt6,"One part of this may also be that the Collector used to be ""male"", and perhaps the costume was designed before casting Awkwafina. This is also pure and rampant speculation on my part."
1345,2020-07-12 17:23:15,hprnt6,"My theory on this has & will always be that the Skeksis language doesn’t *have* gendered pronouns — there’s literally no need for it when they’re all biologically both. When they speak in other languages, they’re just throwing out pronouns more or less arbitrarily.  Some pick one gendered pronoun & stick to it, others go with whatever they fancy.  

I’m kinda more surprised that they all didn’t default to female pronouns, given the matriarchal structure of Gelfling society, which they needed to appeal to, especially in the beginning.  Or maybe they wanted to portray themselves as less threatening, hence the mostly-male pronouns?  Hmm...

It’s a fascinating idea, anyway."

Anyways your point makes sense for ornamentalist and mariner. Mariner is the only one that's been referred to with female pronouns 100% of the time, while Ornamentalist has been on/off either male or female pronouns (but most consistently male pronouns).

Your reasoning for Gourmand and Collector is odd to me as they've always been referred to with male pronouns but you do you. That being said, Collector is voiced by Awkwafina soo"
1350,2020-07-13 15:30:14,hprnt6,"Exactly!  Skeksis are nowhere close to human, so their concepts of gender should correspondingly be just as alien (also: Urskeks. What’s *their* concept of gender?).

but yeah like. definitely  think for the mariner it's just that she's more of a modern skeksis. pretty sure they were all originally envisioned as male to associate masculinity with ego and malice, but pulled back on that over time for reasons.

I'm watching all sorts of interviews or anything Hamilton-related. He's such a genius. We'd probably guess him instantly with his distinct voice, but he's smart, he'd probably switch it up. He's so busy, but I'd love to see him on this too. I can't wait until the live action Little Mermaid. I read he's going to write the music like he did for Moana!"
1379,2020-07-08 20:22:22,hnk8oa,">TURTLE

this is my DREAM. He would SMASH THIS!! He's got a great voice, and he's very physical for a big boned man. Those kicks and spins he's doing before he sits down for interviews. He'd definitely move around and work the stage. He'd be a delight! I love him to pieces."

His voice was already amazing, but in that song, you heard all sorts of different sounds from him and grit and growls when he’s dancing towards the end of that song is AMAZING!! I was blown away"

I just love her acting, she's like that in every project she's been so she's a natural in comedy. I watched every movie she's in and she's the best character in most of them (2nd behind Anne Hathaway in O8, and juuust behind Kevin Hart impersonating Glover in Jumanji). I would never had seen Dude without her (totally useless movie btw). 

Discovered her in Crazy Rich Asians in with she's fantastic and hilarious, she's wonderful in the Farewell and her show is awesome!

Fanboyism off ✌"

1414,2020-09-05 11:15:22,imz8hw,"Florence Pugh is going places for sure. I’m obsessed with Samara Weaving, but she doesn’t really do “a-list” type films, so I think she’s more of like, a “cult star.” I would also love to see some trans A-listers, I think Angelica Ross has potential to go there."
1415,2020-09-05 11:17:30,imz8hw,"The Ringer podcast did a really good countdown for this exact discussion. They had Robert Pattinson at the top of their list for likely to jump to super stardom. He’s famous already, but with the amount of work he’s been doing to distance himself from the years of twilight, paired with the fact he’s signed on to headline a super hero franchise not just the one film, the assumption is, there will be plenty of fresh eyes that will see this actor and not even associate him with twilight, and only associate him with his new stuff, which has pretty much all been good, as he is a great actor with tons of range.

Another one on their list that you don’t have on here was saoirse ronan. 

But if I had to choose, I’d say the top of my list right now would Florence Pugh. And if she makes it out of the upcoming BW movie at marvel, and becomes a face/ major character going forward, I think that’s her ticket to superstardom (If shes not already there)"
1416,2020-09-05 11:19:23,imz8hw,"Sophie Lillis. I think that’s her name, from I Am Not Okay With This"
1417,2020-09-05 11:28:02,imz8hw,"Robert Pattinson is actually an easy one. 

With Tenet just coming out and all - and now with The Batman hype, he'll solidify his place in A-list when that comes out. 

Assuming it's a good movie, of course. But I don't have doubts. Movie looks awesome."
1418,2020-09-03 12:08:17,ilr2ui,And they both will end up friends and ....
1419,2020-09-03 11:38:17,ilr2ui,Karen Gillan is criminally under used
1420,2020-09-03 13:30:02,ilr2ui,That bullies name...Dasani
1421,2020-09-03 15:29:38,ilr2ui,"The actual plot. So basically everyone here got it right.

""The story takes place a decade after an embarrassing prom prank ran Shelly Wheeler (Awkwafina) out of town and so hardened her heart that she became an ice-cold hit-woman. Revenge threatens to be sweet when she learns her next target is her former high school tormentor, Dianna Park (Gillan). But when Dianna unexpectedly befriends Shelly, the assassin finds herself in with the cool crowd, protecting her old nemesis against another hit crew hired to kill them both.""

The unpopular girl plots to defeat the popular girl that ""tormented"" her in high school, and ends up becoming just another popular girl and learns nothing. A story as old as time."
1422,2020-09-03 12:56:14,ilr2ui,"You can imagine the pitch: it's **Mean Girls** meets **Gross Point Blank**!!! Sold!!! Give me more of that premium-grade cocaine!!! 

More seriously, I've liked Awkwafina in what little I've seen of her and Gillan is a highly capable actress. The premise sounds fun enough with plenty of comedic potential. Whether it will be any good or not we shall find out..."
1423,2020-09-03 15:30:11,ilr2ui,So a school shooter but after everyone has graduated... cool...
1424,2020-09-03 13:10:37,ilr2ui,"I'm sorry this thread seems to be filled with ""crap on Awkwafina"" people. 

Personally, I've enjoyed her performances in movies and shows I've seen her in. She's quirky and fun in her roles, and we've all seen the range that Karen Gillan can bring, so they'll probably have a fun dynamic. I'm looking forward to checking it out."
1425,2020-09-03 12:40:01,ilr2ui,Sounds fun. I’ve liked most of Karen and Awkwafina’s movies recently

1435,2020-09-03 14:21:35,ilr2ui,So this show is basically jumanji without the rock and Kevin hart.

1437,2020-09-03 16:31:27,ilr2ui,">	Awkwafina as 

Pass."
1438,2020-09-03 15:40:20,ilr2ui,"If you haven't been exposed to Awkwafina, see at least two movies now.  See The Farewell and Crazy Rich Asians.  The Farewell is one of those strong lead, emotional movies and she knocks it out of the park ... especially since she was known for being more of a rapper and comic.  She owned that movie, and then with the Crazy Rich Asians movie she's funny in it!  I can't wait to see what she's in next."
1439,2020-09-03 17:51:02,ilr2ui,I'm happy to see Gillan getting more work.
1440,2020-09-03 20:07:02,ilr2ui,I think you mean Amy Pond?
1441,2020-09-04 00:31:14,ilr2ui,Premise sounds fine - it always comes down to the execution.
1442,2020-09-04 02:11:28,ilr2ui,So kinda like Gross Pointe Blank?
1443,2020-09-04 04:50:10,ilr2ui,I will always love and respect Karen Gillian as an actor. She did such a great job as Nebula and remains one of my favorite characters in the marvel movie universe. 💕
1444,2020-09-04 11:09:23,ilr2ui,Awkwafina? Idiocracy was a prophesy.
1445,2020-09-04 15:51:09,ilr2ui,Sounds a bit like Killing Eve.
1446,2020-09-03 14:13:52,ilr2ui,If it has Amelia Pond in it I will watch it
1447,2020-09-03 13:27:12,ilr2ui,Do we all just have to pretend that choosing to call yourself “Awkwafina” on purpose isn’t some weirdo shit?

1454,2020-09-03 16:46:56,ilr2ui,Karen Gillian - I love her as Nebula and am busy getting the popcorn ready because I’m about to watch Jumanji for the 6th time. She’s pretty cool.
1455,2020-09-03 14:25:52,ilr2ui,"Wait, didnt Awkwafina just start another show where she was like a 20-something with no motivation? On to the next one?

Edit: looked it up. ""Awkwafina is Nora from Queens"". Who the fuck greenlit that title? Why tf is her name in it?"

1463,2020-09-04 01:11:45,ilr2ui,Awkwafina?
1464,2020-09-03 13:37:29,ilr2ui,This sounds like it’s gonna be a really good film. Both of them are great actors and it sounds like an enjoyable plot

1475,2020-09-03 18:40:30,ilr2ui,'Awkwafina' sounds like an interesting assassin name now that I think about it
1476,2020-09-03 19:04:34,ilr2ui,"Did she change her name as a huge jab at horrific first names? 
I mean, her real name was fine, seems like she either lost a bet, or was going for a joke and had to stick with it."
1477,2020-09-03 19:23:38,ilr2ui,I think I’d prefer if they switched roles honestly....
1478,2020-09-03 19:27:58,ilr2ui,"As long as it doesn’t involve Awkwafina playing gangsta cool kid, it might work. I really liked her in The Farewell, but her character in Oceans 8 was cringe, even though I thought the movie was “ok”."

1480,2020-09-03 19:50:05,ilr2ui,Awkwafina sounds like aquafina(mineral water from pepsi co).

1491,2020-09-04 00:58:25,ilr2ui,Awkwafina looks so much different from her role in Crazy Rich Asians and Jumanji. She somehow looks less annoying. I bet she’s still annoying though. Good for her!

I don’t know a single person who thinks she has any talent, but whatever, I probably wasn’t going to see this movie anyway, so I can’t be mad."

Then there’s keeping her name as “awkwafina” as if that name means something or has any pull to bring in an audience that her real name doesn’t. The rock, Eminem, etc at least have some level of accomplishment to go along with their career names, she seems like the kind of person who thinks her stage name carries some weight. I’d be more inclined to take a peek if she used her real name instead of some middle school wannabe rapper name. You know, the kind where you take a common word or a brand name and spell it differently.

Then there’s the fact that she tries to justify her stage name as something other than what it was... taking Aquafina and spelling it in a way she thought would make her cool"

1687,2020-09-03 11:52:41,ilr2ui,"My guess is using her real name, Nora, doesn't grab attention like her stage name does. Not many things in celebrity culture make sense to me though so I could be wrong."

1693,2020-09-03 15:01:42,ilr2ui,I think she has talent. She's got some good songs; I'm not a fan of all of them but personally I don't know how you can listen to a song like Testify and say she has no talent.
1694,2020-09-03 11:45:28,ilr2ui,"I found her delightful, she certainly has range, she pulled an incredible performance on ""The Farewell"", and she's also charismatic for comedy based on her role on Ocean's 8 and Crazy Rich Asians."

1705,2020-09-03 15:25:44,ilr2ui,The article states that it's after they finish high school so they would be playing age appropriate roles.
1706,2020-09-03 14:59:08,ilr2ui,"I don't think it's set in high school, seems like they'll be adults and it's more of a ""remember when you bullied me in high school"" kind of thing. The nerd you gave a ton of crap in school days is now an assassin as an adult. At least I hope. It would be a big stretch to see either of these two as teenagers lol."

I like both of those actresses although Awkwafina really hasn't done much what I have seen her in shows potential. Gillan is amazing though for sure. But like... let's even say they throw money at it, get a great directed, and hire a talented writing staff... the core plot is just such a god damn turd sandwhich...

Edit: Holy crap I just looked up who's involved in this and... this is going to be awful. This is going to be another one of those movies involving a decent cast that get destroyed critically. This is the type of shit that would have NEVER been made prior to the streaming giants scrambling to buy up as much content as possible.

I would love to know how they managed on selling this to someone based on their existing resumes."

1737,2020-09-03 19:59:38,ilr2ui,I really enjoyed her in *Touch of Cloth*. Basically British Naked Gun/Angie Tribeca created by Charlie Brooker.

1739,2020-09-03 18:42:00,ilr2ui,Thee should be one more Jumanji with the Rock and crew. I suspect they delayed everything due to COVID

Not me, maybe the fact that she’s bald and entirely blue helped."
1741,2020-09-03 15:25:52,ilr2ui,"Honestly her appearance in the first Guardians felt super cartoonish and she felt like the weakest link there, but she really stepped it up for Guardians 2 and Infinity War/Endgame. She feels like the most successful Doctor Who Alumnus. Other people might have steady TV careers, but it's hard for people to leap from TV to movies."

1743,2020-09-03 14:05:38,ilr2ui,Not sure how you could see Amy Pond. I didn't even know it was Gillian until the credits rolled.
1744,2020-09-03 14:25:28,ilr2ui,"As someone who wasn't a fan of her in Doctor Who, I'm quite happy that she has been so different in movies since as I've really enjoyed her performances and look forward to her being in more."
1745,2020-09-03 16:32:48,ilr2ui,"Yeah, I was so pumped to see her in the cast list. And ... It turned out to be one small scene. What a bummer"
1746,2020-09-03 18:14:13,ilr2ui,"I spent the entire movie thinking that >!Karen Gillan was going to come back as the villain at the end, because it didn't make sense for her to be in such a small part. But I guess she kind of did it as a favour to Dave Bautista or something. Anyway, still an enjoyable movie.!<"

1752,2020-09-03 14:10:57,ilr2ui,Doctor Who does have its passionate base but doesn't really turn people into household stars. MCU definitely agree but she is in heavy makeup and on a lower tier.
1753,2020-09-03 14:55:52,ilr2ui,"Doctor Who is no way ""the biggest TV franchise""."
1754,2020-09-03 20:28:50,ilr2ui,"People womder why they dont see her in stuff everyday.

But thats exactly the point. Actors who *have* to take every job are the ones that cant get good roles. Gillan actually has a career so she can pick roles that are good."

1758,2020-09-03 13:37:30,ilr2ui,Came here to say this. Anyone that doesn't like Awkafina is just admitting that they haven't watched that movie.
1759,2020-09-03 21:11:21,ilr2ui,The moving where she mopes for the whole movie?
1760,2020-09-03 13:58:57,ilr2ui,Honestly I think the name is about 90% of it.
1761,2020-09-03 14:03:19,ilr2ui,"I'd assume it comes from the first impression that her name is annoying. It's kind of off-putting right off the bat. She chose a stage name that sounds like it came straight out of the Key and Peele ""East/West Bowl"" skit."
1762,2020-09-03 13:27:41,ilr2ui,I honestly have no idea. I enjoy her performances.
1763,2020-09-03 14:11:25,ilr2ui,"She's a female comedian, and this is reddit."
1764,2020-09-03 14:01:53,ilr2ui,"I literally think it's just because she goes by ""Awkwafina"". I've only seen her in Jumanji but thought she was pretty good."

2.	Woman (“diversity hire”)

3.	Asian (see above)"
1768,2020-09-03 15:46:10,ilr2ui,She's asian and was big on youtube before going into Hollywood.
1769,2020-09-04 07:27:28,ilr2ui,"Idk how anyone would dislike her. Never heard of her before, saw her in Jumanji and she stole the show. Absolutely hilarious lol. Fuck everyone who’s hating"
1770,2020-09-03 23:15:27,ilr2ui,"Personally, I just don't find her that funny. However, I wouldn't go out of the way to shit on her.

I prefer her as a supporting role rather than a lead. At least in the movies I've watched."
1771,2020-09-03 15:36:05,ilr2ui,"Because the YouTube to Hollywood pipeline is bullshit and it results in casting based on who has the most followers rather than who's best for the role. It also results in these performers essentially delivering the same performance in everything because they were cast with the expectation of transferring their YouTube persona to film. I don't have anything against Awkwafina really, I'm not even sure I've seen anything she's been in. I'm also not saying these YouTube stars are not capable of being great actors. I'm just saying the Hollywood mechanisms that create spaces for these people are fundamentally uncreative, put those performers into boxes, and more often than not sacrifice the overall movie/show by prioritizing social media clout over everything else."
1772,2020-09-03 19:53:18,ilr2ui,Because she is a bad actress
1773,2020-09-03 14:20:11,ilr2ui,She’s fucking annoying.
1774,2020-09-03 14:32:49,ilr2ui,"While not enough to make me actively rag on anyone, but generally speaking I can’t take anyone seriously who goes by a one-word name that they made up for themselves.  I suspect some other people are similar and some subset of those are also more prone to lash out and “crap on” said person.

(I do understand that it’s more common for rap artists than for other musicians though, sure.)"
1775,2020-09-04 02:02:57,ilr2ui,I loved her in that. She does a good Devito.
1776,2020-09-03 20:18:29,ilr2ui,Seriously. When they had her playing the introvert I thought “oh god she’s playing herself” and then they switched and I loved every second of it.
1777,2020-09-03 20:59:12,ilr2ui,"She made the movie almost unwatchable to me. Such horrific overacting (and yes I am aware we are talking about the insane Jumanji sequel). Her acting was 30% voice, 30% face and 40% body language. Exhausting. 

That being said, I dont know her in anything else and have no personal grudge against her. Many good actors had horrible performances and maybe this performance just didnt fit my taste"
1778,2020-09-04 01:42:27,ilr2ui,"I enjoy her immensely, but Nora just didn't hook me. But I think her and Rihanna were the only redeeming features of Ocean's 8."
1779,2020-09-03 20:18:02,ilr2ui,I wouldn't say it was really funny but I really liked Nora.
1780,2020-09-04 01:14:42,ilr2ui,Something something awkward quirky person
1781,2020-09-03 15:22:02,ilr2ui,Well at least they'r at home compiling videos and not roaming the streets.
1782,2020-09-03 13:41:14,ilr2ui,"Netflix got rid of CBB last month, but you can watch the full episode on [ifc.com](https://ifc.com) if you have a compatible ISP."
1783,2020-09-03 13:17:06,ilr2ui,"Apparently it's a stage name she adopted at 16, and it comes from her saying she's ""awkward but that's fine"""
1784,2020-09-03 20:21:34,ilr2ui,"She used to make comedy rap videos on Youtube and that was her rap name so it sort of stuck when she started doing other things.

I hope she does what The Rock does and starts calling herself Nora ""Akwafina"" Lum and then Nora Lum."
1785,2020-09-03 20:06:30,ilr2ui,yeah i thought Bojack Horseman had made that character up....
1786,2020-09-03 18:17:31,ilr2ui,Duhsawni would be the name of an actress who is completely terrible but keeps getting roles in absolutely everything so you can never escape.
1787,2020-09-03 13:16:16,ilr2ui,My favorite are the ones who pretend they have no idea who artists like Justin Bieber or Taylor Swift are. Like we're meant to believe they're so cool and unique that they've somehow managed to avoid any and all news about major artists while hanging out daily in entertainment subs.
1788,2020-09-03 20:25:10,ilr2ui,"I think if TitShark made it big enough to have their name on movie posters and in the credits of shows that they would probably use something less inane. But I would have thought that about Awkwafina too, yet here we are."
1789,2020-09-03 21:02:07,ilr2ui,"Lol idiot, I don't go by that name in person."
1790,2020-09-03 19:18:46,ilr2ui,So is being unfunny.
1791,2020-09-03 13:37:04,ilr2ui,"At least Aquafina was already a word, people acting like she coulda called herself “Zorp Glop McWheelbarrow” and it would be rad"
1792,2020-09-04 00:50:33,ilr2ui,"The actor who has played such roles as ""Eminem"", ""Eminem"", ""Eminem"", ""Eminem"", and ""Eminem""? A better comparison would be Queen Latifah or LL Cool J."
1793,2020-09-03 20:09:49,ilr2ui,"False. If I am already on a Reddit post it is faster to type a three word question here than it is to close the Reddit app, open an internet browser, and then type in my query."
1794,2020-09-03 16:23:07,ilr2ui,"No, you"
1795,2020-09-03 19:18:59,ilr2ui,Aziz Ansari got one for acting too Lol
1796,2020-09-03 19:50:02,ilr2ui,It was also very unwatchable.
1797,2020-09-03 20:50:35,ilr2ui,"I’m all for more representation for both women and women of color but they should at least have some sort of acting ability. 

Awkwafina is just the new token Asian lady that they can stick in every film that need to represent Asian women and call it a day."
1798,2020-09-03 15:58:31,ilr2ui,"Ok, I've never seen the show, but I've watched clips and I thought that Sandra Oh was hired to kill the blonde chick. I must be mistaken"

FTFY."
1800,2020-09-03 13:47:40,ilr2ui,"I agree too many people are hating her but I still dpo find it a little weird when people use stage names like that in theater and film be it 50 cent, boots riley, or awkwafina. I am fine with it, just found it a little strange at first"

1803,2020-09-03 13:33:37,ilr2ui,"Cause maybe he doesn’t want an attempted identity theft every times he posts? We already know the woman’s real name, there no need for made up words modeled after bottled water"
1804,2020-09-03 11:24:08,ilr2ui,No I can't spot marketing shills. How much are they paying you to promote this. It looks like a shitty female remake of grosse point blank
1805,2020-09-03 11:49:00,ilr2ui,"I'm inclined to agree, can't wait to see this!  I'm a fan of her music and she makes me laugh."
1806,2020-09-03 12:34:44,ilr2ui,I thought she was pretty good in the newest Jumanji as well
1807,2020-09-03 12:13:04,ilr2ui,Good effort but you’re wasting your time on haters.
1808,2020-09-03 15:30:12,ilr2ui,"A hitman adjusting/struggling with a new change in life. Seems far reached, yeah."
1809,2020-09-03 15:30:57,ilr2ui,I guess the Downvoters have never been bullied
1810,2020-09-03 17:41:21,ilr2ui,Didn’t change anything after re reading. The article still says they’re in high school specifically in prom season... these actors are both 32 years old.
1811,2020-09-03 13:17:54,ilr2ui,Damn how’d you do that

1814,2020-09-03 19:03:25,ilr2ui,Her acting is up there with Elizabeth Berkley in Showgirls. Her acting is distractingly bad.
1815,2020-09-03 11:51:21,ilr2ui,Well at least that's good
1816,2020-09-03 15:02:32,ilr2ui,Lol.okay yeah that makes more sense.
1817,2020-09-03 15:28:59,ilr2ui,"If that's the twist, it was way more of a plot runway than a twist"
1818,2020-09-03 15:26:02,ilr2ui,"And it is revealed that the parents' hatred of their love has nothing to do with them being assassins or anything bigoted. Its because Gillian is a Pisces and Awkwafina is a Leo,  and Pisces and Leos should never hook up when Mars is in retrograde (their parents are also astrologists)."
1819,2020-09-03 15:54:14,ilr2ui,Nah thats season 2s plot
1820,2020-09-03 16:21:37,ilr2ui,Stop giving away the sequel.

1823,2020-09-04 05:17:16,ilr2ui,So its a hidden John Wick spinoff?
1824,2020-09-03 21:03:14,ilr2ui,The cliff hanger will be Awkwafina in a beard yelling “WHAT YEAR IS IT???”
1825,2020-09-03 20:44:19,ilr2ui,"You should check out The Farewell. Awkwafina is fantastic in it. It's a comedy/drama. 

Also I think this movie is going to be like a typical Kevin Hart movie. Funny moments but overall kind of dumb but still fun to watch. It's not going to win any awards but it probablt won't be awful."
1826,2020-09-03 20:46:50,ilr2ui,It's like if Carrie and Grosse Pointe Blank had a baby
1827,2020-09-04 10:02:30,ilr2ui,"While I agree that it doesn't like an Oscar worthy story, I wouldn't be as bold as to declare it's awful for 100% certainty.  It doesn't sound like something I'd care to watch for sure, but movies like these were never about being groundbreaking.  They adhere to a specific demographic which results in $$$."
1828,2020-09-04 03:37:01,ilr2ui,She has a small part but Awkwafina's great in The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance.
1829,2020-09-04 05:33:13,ilr2ui,"So apparently Seth Rogen moonlights as a script doctor and he said that there are some scripts that are basically scams that end up with great financing and a high profile cast, but that there is just no salvaging the movie because the script is so bad.  Like RDJs Doolittle movie"
1830,2020-09-03 21:28:28,ilr2ui,Give her show Nora From Queens a try
1831,2020-09-03 15:40:11,ilr2ui,I was sad when she got blown up after only two episodes in Westworld.

1835,2020-09-04 09:01:40,ilr2ui,"Yes was going to mention Oculus.

That was her first role I saw outside of Dr who, and I was SO impressed by her American accent. It sounded so normal.

Cough benedictcumberbatch cough. I love that man but his accent was..."
1836,2020-09-03 18:11:58,ilr2ui,Oculus is criminally underrated.

1844,2020-09-03 13:48:17,ilr2ui,Lmao yeah like Nebula is nothing alike to Amy Pond in personality or physical appearance. It’s like “bruh I couldn’t help but see The Doctor when played that evil elf dude in Thor 2!!”

1851,2020-09-03 15:17:16,ilr2ui,"Dude... her Jumanji films have made over 1.6 billion dollars. She was the female lead next to the biggest star in Hollywood and two of the biggest comedian actors. When the pandemic ends there's probably going to be a third one.

She's not lacking for attention or good jobs."
1852,2020-09-03 14:19:09,ilr2ui,Depends which country that household is in. :)
1853,2020-09-03 20:55:23,ilr2ui,"I feel like Doctor Who makes the actors more popular in the UK but doesnt do much to help in the US. 

David Tennant is a great example. A lot of people in the US know him asBarty Crouch Jr from harry Potter or Kilgrave from Jessica Jones but in the UK he is super well known."
1854,2020-09-03 17:45:54,ilr2ui,Ye I'd argue that Star Trek is far more global and has had quite a few stars pass though it.

1882,2020-09-03 14:03:15,ilr2ui,"Well there's a bit of a bias there, we both know who those people are so it becomes unbelievable to us that people wouldn't recognise them. On the other hand I guarantee there are people you know that I don't recognise, that's not to say I haven't heard their names, they just didn't lodge in my brain. Seems to happen more as you get older or less interested in that part of pop culture. For instance I keep being surprised by the existence of new Kardashians. Off the top of my head I can name Kim and Kylie? Slap a Kardashian after any name and I will fully believe its another one, but to a lot of people they will be incredulous that I don't know the Kardashians.

So to summarise its really difficult to know what bits of pop culture have bypassed other people."

1898,2020-09-03 17:06:01,ilr2ui,"If you'd said Grosse Pointe Blank, you'd have a better argument.  Hitman goes back to his hometown for a high school reunion is a lot more like hitwoman goes back to her hometown for her high school reunion.  Also, there's no chance that the soundtrack will be anywhere near as good since Joe Strummer won't be putting it together."

1901,2020-09-04 17:48:11,ilr2ui,"Kevin Hart literally carries those films on his back and works his absolute ass off. I'm not saying these women don't work hard, but I don't think that comparison is fair to what Hart does. He basically turned that type of film into a formula perfectly suited to his skillset. Ultimately, the plot/writing doesn't matter as much because people aren't there for the plot, they're there to watch him be him. Neither Awkwafina or Gillen have that. Not an insult to them, there aren't a lot of people that do have it."
1902,2020-09-04 04:11:17,ilr2ui,Grosse Point Blank is a hilarious movie.
1903,2020-09-04 04:37:17,ilr2ui,Sounds more like an abortion.
1904,2020-09-04 17:56:27,ilr2ui,"To be clear here my claim that it will definitely be complete trash is not based on the synopsis. The plot is like child level basic but I've seen similar simplistic crap actually end up being entertaining and watchable. Won't break any records but it would be fun. 

The reason I say it's going to be horrible is based on the fact that neither the writers nor the director have any experience at all in basically anything. The director has basically done random 1-2 episode runs on various TV shows. She's basically a fill in for when no one else can be found to paint by numbers shoot an episode of an existing series. Neither of the writers have a single credit worth even repeating. 

When the two people responsible for the script and the person responsible for directing the film combine for zero experience... and they go and slap a couple shinny actresses on the poster? That's a recipe for a dog shit movie lol."
1905,2020-09-04 17:53:59,ilr2ui,"Absolutely. Usually when you dig in a little deeper you start to see exactly what's going on too. With Doolittle apparently RDJ was OBSESSED with making that fucking movie. I have NO idea why but literally without him the movie wouldn't have existed. It's unsurprising to me that they either invested as little quality resources as possible in it or he just got sold a snake oil script by someone who knew he was desperate to make the movie anyways. 

Looking into this one things are even more obvious. The whole thing was packaged by UTA. UTA represents the writers and both of those actresses. The only person not represented by UTA is the director. So you have a script written by two people represented by the agency that also represents two fairly decent sized female names, during a period where everyone is trying to push for greater representation in media and the streaming giants are at war over gobbling up content. 

I can't imagine Gillen or Awkwafina had much of a choice regarding their involvement but I'm sure they're being paid well either way. They probably walked in with a script and told Amazon that it's Carrie meets Gross Pointe Blank and they already had Gillen and Awkwafina on board. I damn well guarantee you that they made sure to mention Awkwafina was Asian too."
1906,2020-09-04 17:49:42,ilr2ui,"Watched the first season. Second hasn't come out yet has it? Liked it overall. They leaned a little too hard on some stuff, but with the limited number of episodes there really wasn't that much they could have done. 

If you liked Nora From Queens check out a Canadian show called Kim's Convenience. Very similar (but more family friendly) vibe."
1907,2020-09-03 17:36:38,ilr2ui,I’m sure she’ll be a robot next season.
1908,2020-09-03 20:54:16,ilr2ui,"Yep but Awkwafina‘s performance almost ruined the sequel for me. My god was it bad...

And nothing against her personally and maybe she is awesome in other movies."

We're talking about people saying Awkafina can't act who obviously haven't seen her in the role that won her Best Actress Golden Globe.

Nobody is assuming that people must hate her because they didn't like a role. People in this thread ARE actively saying that they hate her because they didn't like a role."

At some point she needs to do what the Rock did and transition from Awkwafina to Nora ""Awkwafina"" Lum and finally to Nora Lum."

1963,2020-09-03 17:48:39,ilr2ui,Second sentence in the first paragraph. Story is based in high school as a premise. It’s no different than Kevin hart and the rock’s central intelligence movie. Starts in high school and reunited. Same thing. You’re not doing a good job in the details of stories. It’s still a story about high school just like central intelligence. It’s not an original story line by any means.

Kumail Nanjiani has done a couple of them that have been successful(Stuber, The Lovebirds). Will Ferrell has done them...So has Mark Whalberg(with Will Ferrell)...And they are more well known than Awkwafina and Karen Gillan but these 2 girls are also faily early on in their career. Awkwafina has only been getting popular for the last couple years. Gillan has been working longer but mostly in the UK. They are both talented enough to pull this off in my opinion."

I'm looking at his filmography, and trying to find the last decently-sized budget film with him that wasn't profitable. Empire State was a low-budget direct-to-DVD film (I'd love to know how that got made in the first place) that didn't do great, but it's the only one. Doom is basically his biggest flop, and it made back the budget as a VG movie where DVD sales are expected to prop up the the box office gross anyway.

People love him."
1980,2020-09-03 20:48:11,ilr2ui,"So are awards shows bullshit or not? Because everyone is so quick to call them bullshit until it's time to defend the actor/actress they love, then they completely ignore it and use it as a reason why they *must* be enjoyed and respected.

Just because someone has a stage name that you might find odd doesn't mean their whole career must by extension be crap. 

 Lady Gaga? Didn't exactly choose a ""normal"" stage name (read somewhere that she chose it based on the Queen song ""Radio Ga-Ga"" where they literally use nonsensical words in the song), but by all rights she's considered a great performer of multiple genres. 

Everyone is completely entitled to their opinion, i just find it sad that a person's name would prevent someone from giving something a chance to enjoy something new. How limiting a world that must be for a person to not be willing to try new things because of a preconceived prejudice because someone has a different name."

You’ve yet to prove that this movie is not based around events in high school equal to that of the central intelligence movie. 

Just because the characters are ethnically and genderly different with slightly different professions does not make this movie unique or different to the point I originally stated and you arrogantly jumped on with your 2 cents. This concept for a movie is boring. Will the movie be boring I don’t know. But high school premises for movies are typical"

Revenge threatens to be sweet when she learns her next target is her former high school tormentor, Dianna Park (Gillan). But when Dianna unexpectedly befriends Shelly, the assassin finds herself in with the cool crowd, protecting her old nemesis against another hit crew hired to kill them both."""

2043,2020-09-03 17:00:45,ilr2ui,He is not trying to be taken as a serious actor though.  The dudes name plays perfectly with the type of rolls he takes...
2044,2020-09-03 14:02:41,ilr2ui,"I'm not riled up, I'm explaining my point of view because you just like to throw out those half sentence responses"
2045,2020-09-03 18:09:00,ilr2ui,"How is the premise different than central intelligence? 2 characters that knew each other in high school? Same thing here. Jobs, genders are different sure. But simply put its the same story. It’s not like one character is going to actually end another character before the end of the movie... lol it’s hollywood. Generic happy ending will always be standard to these buddy movies"
2046,2020-09-03 18:06:18,ilr2ui,"Here's the thing. Those are primarily 2-hit combos with a silly bit and a cool/noble bit. Ice is cool. Gambino is cool. Lady & Prince are noble. 
Vin has oomph, and Diesel is inherently manly/boyish, so as a 2-hit combo it just works.   
  
Cher stands out. It's not stressed and sorta just fizzles airily. I never cared much for her stagename, but I appreciate the music. ""Sonny and Cher"" improves this a lot since sonny is homely and kind of silly, elevating the francophone ""Cher"" to a more noble status and creating contrast.   
  
And this is where Awkwafina falls flat on it's face. ""Awkwa"" sounds halfway to awkward and the isolated spelling looks preposterous. The ending -fina adds nothing cool or fancy, if anything it makes it sound like an immature prep-girl - inherently uncool.  
  
Please consider these: ""Ice-fina""  ""Vin-fina""  
It just robs the sound of any oomph, suave or je ne sais quoi.  
  
It's just not woody like ""Gorn"". Awkwina would be tons better, skipping the dreaded tinny ""f"" and swallowing up an ""a"" for a sharper feminisation and a touch of royalty. Pherhaps even Awkwafinna, giving more emphasis and snarky slang. Might even get herself a catchphrase like ""Awkwafinna drown u boi!""  
  
But alas, her name is not of our choosing. And so it is, that as a random person on the internet, I just find that name offputting - in spite of what I can only assume are delightful talents."
2047,2020-09-03 16:53:09,ilr2ui,"I am not trying to shit on her choice of stage name, only to explain why other find it off putting enough to avoided her films because of the name.

I think she also suffers from being a B list actor and comedian so does not have the star power to own the name..."
2048,2020-09-03 17:07:04,ilr2ui,"Movies are good in spite of her, not because of her. Don't be bitter with me because of your shit taste in movies/actors."
2049,2020-09-03 14:07:06,ilr2ui,"The fact that someone’s inoffensive stage name bothers you enough to comment about it several times in this thread shows that you’re pretty riled up about nothing. Just let it go, you’ll feel a lot better."
2050,2020-09-03 18:10:02,ilr2ui,"I don't know, I've never seen it, I'm just responding to the part where you keep saying it's a high school movie when it isn't"

2053,2020-09-03 18:15:49,ilr2ui,It’s a high school movie. These characters are tied to high school. Just like central intelligence the movie with Kevin hart and the rock. Did I say this movie is for teenagers? No. You guys are reading into what offends your definition than simply comparing movies that have done this genre before. Just because the high school term shows up doesn’t mean it’s a movie about teenagers. High school is a crutch for poor writers who can’t write something original. Why can’t they be ex-co workers at a yogurt shop? Why high school? If you can’t understand what I’m pointing to in terms of context to story concept then you’re out of touch as a creative who focuses on story. The last guy couldn’t even understand high school from high schoolers. Don’t make the same mistake.
2054,2020-09-03 17:12:21,ilr2ui,"Just because you're choosing to ignore my argument doesn't mean it's not there, and at least I'm addressing you instead of hiding behind snarky misrepresentation fallacies :)"
2055,2020-09-03 14:11:45,ilr2ui,I just it’s a little immature to get upset about something that “sounds weird”. I barely even know who she is so no white knighting here. I’m just saying you’ll be happier when you stop nitpicking at inconsequential things
2056,2020-09-03 18:24:17,ilr2ui,"You are the only one mentioning Central Intelligence. No one cares. But your refusal to admit you are incorrect is hilarious, dipshit. Every film in existence that features adults is a “post high school” movie, you incredible asshat.  Doesn’t make them high school movies.  No one is mentioning ethnicity or gender either except you, again, because you are a huge moron. This is not a high school movie."

I've literally only said that the made up name she chose is some weirdo shit, cause newflash homie, it's some straight up weirdo shit"
2059,2020-09-03 18:27:25,ilr2ui,Lol. Took you 20 minutes to restructure my sentence I previously used. Haha. Oh man. Thanks for caring. I thought you didn’t care about this movie like you stated previously on this specific thread. But oh well. No ones perfect. I forgive you. I’ll still love you even when you won’t love your self homie.
2060,2020-09-03 17:17:39,ilr2ui,"Which is literally what started the conversation - your comment trying to make up some double standard that doesn't exist. If she had decent music or acting capabilities, there wouldn't be a stigma about her stupid stage name. More people are fine with ""Childish Gambino"" because he has talent. Less people are fine with ""Akwafina"" because she doesn't. No double standard there - people would hate on him if his acting was shit, too."
2061,2020-09-03 14:15:35,ilr2ui,Something wrong with being “weird”?
2062,2020-09-03 18:28:36,ilr2ui,"No I just have a job, child. Your responses make you seem like a teenager, btw. Also that last response was so embarrassing, my friend. Like just admit you are wrong. You are just making yourself look even dumber."

I mean I’ve yet to hear teenagers to talk about complex story lines and story arch’s and repetitive premises for movies and how they’re crafted. But I’ll go ahead accept your troll rage because I love you bro. Even when you won’t. It’s just a movie. Maybe we can see your remake of this movie in the coming years."
2066,2020-09-03 17:23:13,ilr2ui,"1) We're online BOTH pushing opinions, so if you're trying to call me an idiot for arguing over an opinion...


2) We were talking about the existence of a double standard, and why one does or doesn't exist. You legit said in your initial post I responded to that people like what Donald Glover does, so they're more okay with his stage name. I was just correcting with my opinion what you said about her (lack of) talent.


""Childlish Gambino is also a ridiculous stage name, but people like Donald Glover's work so they don't care. It's a weird double standard.""

I’m surprised you didn’t read it. It’s about the movie, you know 2 high schoolers who reunite and end up becoming friends just like central intelligence. It’s ok if you don’t understand. When we watch it together I’ll make sure to get your favorite binky and bib so we can watch it together like one happy bro couple. I’ll make sure you get the booster seat at the theaters when they open up. Anyways make sure you read the article. I know these are your type of movie"

If you look back through the thread, you’ll see that you are arguing with two different people about something neither of us are talking about.  I thought that the explanation of “this film doesn’t take place in high school, so it isn’t a high school movie” was pretty straight forward but apparently it’s a bit of a difficult concept? This is like when a child doesn’t have an argument so they just start saying immature nonsense.  Like I gotta be real- if this makes you feel better, I guess you won the argument you were having with yourself."
2084,2020-09-03 20:12:55,ilr2ui,"Lol. The guy who couldn’t tell the difference between high school premise and high school teen movie is now trying to sound intellectual by referencing something he’s even vaguely beating the bush about. The same guy who said he didn’t care and is now 10 comments deep into a reddit thread because he wanted the last word. Lol. The hypocrisy. He fails to acknowledge his own self in the mirror bypassing his principal he stated himself that he didn’t care for this movie and dismissed it after a weak argument and stance that this movie has nothing to do with high school, trying to echo that high school will never be apart of this movie. Seriously, don’t quit your day job. You’re not meant to be a story teller. This is nothing to do with winning. I mean you asked me to re read the article no you simply don’t want to give in that this movie’s premise is about 2 people from the same high school that I said is lame that we have another story about people in high school. Good luck in life bro. You can have the last word. Lol not worth it with someone who wants to be little spoon"
2085,2020-09-03 20:15:15,ilr2ui,"Dude I promise you no one cares about this. I didn’t even read this response.  Your rigid inability to accept that you were incorrect is like bordering on autism, which is why I brought it up. Have a good Thursday night! Maybe learn to read and practice limiting run on sentences.

Edit: read your response and you literally prove yourself wrong in your own response. God you are such an embarrassing person. I’m not a good story teller? What the fuck are you even talking about, man? Good god I almost feel bad arguing with someone who is obviously not all there in the head.

25% of the primetime cast was asian (along with several replacement hosts and longtime cast members who werent white)... 

g4 is a tech focused network - a foodie/comedy skit show doesnt fit that segment

the network needs a show to appeal to a broad audience in order to stay in business via ad revenue - shows that single out a particular ethnic group are probably unsustainable"

2110,2020-08-31 09:00:23,ijn7wd,How many Comedy Central shows do you see moving to CBS All Access and how many do you see moving here?
2111,2020-08-31 19:01:16,ijn7wd,Bring back @midnight! That show was the fucking best
2112,2020-08-31 01:40:35,ijn7wd,I think ViacomCBS are open to selling shows to other networks or streamers and it is clear that HBO Max are happy to buy stuff from outside studios but I doubt they will pick up all of CC cancelled fare. If The Other Two and South Side perform well I think HBO Max might be open to buying more new shows from then in the future. I read somewhere that CC were happy to continue producing new live action shows that they could sell to air on other networks or streamers. They are trying to transition CC into a brand rather than just a channel as it is perceived now.
2113,2020-08-31 17:29:28,ijn7wd,"Honestly, I wouldn’t even be surprised to see HBO Max interested one acquiring Nora From Queens (fully), Drunk History, and Tosh.0. ViacomCBS and Comedy Central pretty much made it clear that these shows won’t be showing up on any sister networks or CBS All Access, and HBO Max seems like the best option since they already offer 4 Comedy Central Productions on their services."
2114,2020-08-31 18:02:56,ijn7wd,I do wonder if they will continue licensing out *South Park*'s exclusive streaming rights after the current HBO Max deal ends or finally take this back for CBS All Access. However given the fact ViacomCBS is trying to cut costs wherever they can something tells me they will continue to license the rights out to the highest bidder.
2115,2020-09-01 01:01:05,ijn7wd,Wow.

2117,2020-08-31 19:02:46,ijn7wd,"Well to give an idea here is the breakdown of existing Comedy Central shows:

* **CBS All Access** (shared with Comedy Central Now)
   * Current: None
   * Ended: *Reno 911!* (Seasons 1-6)\*, *Chappelle's Show*, *tosh.0* (2009-2011),  *Drawn Together*, *Ugly Americans*, *Kroll Show*, *Another Period*, *This Is Not Happening* 
   * Film: *Strangers With Candy*
   * Repackaged: *The Daily Show with Trevor Noah: Global Edition* (May 30, 2019 - March 13, 2020 episodes) 
* **HBO Max** (Streaming Exclusive)
   * Current: *South Park* (Season 1 - present, [except for five episodes](https://collider.com/south-park-hbo-max-missing-episodes-explained/)), *Awkwafina Is Nora from Queens* (Season 1 - present) 
   * Moving from CC to HBO Max:  *South Side* (Season 2), *The Other Two* (Season 2)
* **Quibi** (Exclusive)
   * Current/Quibi Originals: *Reno 911!* (Season 7)
   * Moved/moving from CC to Quibi: *Alternatino with Arturo Castro* (Season 2)

**Notes:**

* The Comedy Central brand hub on CBS All Access is a rehash of content already available to subscribers of Comedy Central Now (nothing is exclusive to CBS All Access.)
   * *This Is Not Happening* is also available to BET+ subscribers. 
   * Comedy Central Now features more TV shows from Comedy Central's library and comedy series from TV Land. 
      * For potential shows that could head to CBS All Access look at the shows [currently available on Comedy Central Now](https://reelgood.com/tv/source/comedycentralstandupplus).
* A small hand-picked selection of *South Park* episodes are available to stream for free [at the official website](https://southpark.cc.com/) or through Comedy Central's TV Everywhere app. 
* *Awkwafina Is Nora from Queens* is also available through Comedy Central's TV Everywhere app. HBO Max is the only place to watch this show without a pay-TV provider.
   * Presently *South Side* & *The Other Two*'s first seasons are also on the Comedy Central TV Everywhere app. The first seasons of these shows will head to HBO Max in 2021 with their second seasons becoming Max Originals."
2118,2020-08-31 17:27:34,ijn7wd,0 and 3 💀
2119,2020-08-31 19:27:34,ijn7wd,">@midnight

Since its election season I just rewatched the @ midnight Trump Bernie debate on Youtube. Classic."
2120,2020-08-31 19:46:20,ijn7wd,"Pretty much that is [what they said](https://deadline.com/2020/08/comedy-central-the-other-two-south-side-hbo-max-originals-awkwafina-is-nora-from-queens-svod-rights-1203012460/) as part of the announcement for *Awkawfina is Nora from Queens*, *South Side* and *The Other Two*. 

Wall Street is still trying to figure out how ViacomCBS' plans will work with their goal of expanding CBS All Access to compete with Netflix, Disney+/Hulu, HBO Max & Peacock. 

HBO Max already has 3 shows in development from CBS Television Studios. The deal with Comedy Central Productions essentially builds on HBO Max's exclusive streaming rights for *South Park*. 

All of ViacomCBS' internal production studios are open to developing content (either based on an existing IP or a new IP) for competitors and streamers. Netflix & Nickelodeon has [a multi-year output deal](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963816/spongebob-squarepants-spinoff-netflix-nickelodeon-deal-disney-streaming) which includes a *SpongeBob SquarePaints* spin-off for example.

Live action comedies apparently are not doing well on linear cable anymore. The Deadline article I linked above even noted this:

> Additionally, FX’s new comedy *Dave* has been a very modest performer on the linear network but a streaming hit on FX on Hulu. 

Adult animation comedies are cheaper to produce than live action comedies. Animation, in general, is also COVID proof as they can be made remotely."
2121,2020-08-31 20:26:36,ijn7wd,"Actually I'm surprised they didn't send *Tosh.0* to MTV as it would compliment their 18+ hours/day of *Ridiculousness*. 

However I do think *Tosh.0* would be a better fit for regular HBO instead of HBO Max. They could have *Tosh.0* air during *Last Week Tonight*'s off season which is typically November - February or just outright pair it with *Last Week Tonight* or *Real Time*."
2122,2020-08-31 19:14:44,ijn7wd,Comedy Central has a paid subscription service?
2123,2020-08-31 19:33:05,ijn7wd,"Yes! Also, FYI Pluto TV airs a 2 hour block of this show every night at midnight now and then airs a 3 hour block from 9am-12pm every day on their Comedy Central Stand-Up channel. They're airing them in chronological order too. They're in July in 2014 right now. It's been a blast to go back to this show."
2124,2020-08-31 21:01:23,ijn7wd,"I think the programming strategy for HBO Max and the direction AT&T are going in as a business on the whole is pretty clear to see. The change in management might see a few tweaks in the programming content direction but I think the overall strategy will not change too much. HBO Max is trying to position itself as a new Netflix. 

Things are a lot less clear with ViacomCBS. I’m not even sure they know what they are going to do with their various media properties at this point. I think that makes them a fascinating watch over the next couple of years. They do not seem fully committed to streaming and it feels like they are only making the efforts they are because they feel they have to rather than because it is something they believe they can make a success. 

I was a fan of how CBS ran their media company (they had a good thing with CBS, CBS All Access, and Showtime) but I was not a fan at all of how the management at Viacom ran their half of the company. I hated what they did to the likes of CC, MTV, and Spike and was also unimpressed by how they have dealt with the Channel 5 Networks in the UK. I know they have done OK from a financial POV but I think the switch from scripted to unscripted on those networks has been awful from a personal POV. On top of that it has not exactly been a stellar decade for Paramount at the Box Office. 

It worries me that the guys who made the decisions at Viacom at that time are now pretty much in charge of running the combined ViacomCBS properties. I think they have been spectacularly awful for Showtime over the last year. Cancelling shows willy-nilly and just generally decreasing the volume of scripted content on the network. It is a real shame! It will be interesting to see what they do with CBS All Access but I’ve not heard anything so far that leaves me with much confidence they are going to be anything more than a niche player in the streaming market. Netflix has proven people will pay for a steady stream of scripted content but I’m not sure I see unscripted selling too many streaming subscriptions so it might be a tough decade ahead for ViacomCBS."
2125,2020-09-02 11:44:48,ijn7wd,"I thought sending it to MTV or CBS All Access was a no brained as well and was surprised when they said it wasn’t moving to a sister service or network too.

I don’t feel it’s a good fit for HBO because I do think the humor and production is more juvenile than what HBO has but as a Max Original it seems to fit alongside that stuff more naturally."
2126,2020-08-31 20:16:35,ijn7wd,"The **TL;DR** version is Yes and it is available through Apple TV Channels, The Roku Channel (I believe) and Prime Video Channels for $3.99/mo.

The long version, a complete list of all ViacomCBS' streaming services. If you thought WarnerMedia was crazy & out of touch for having HBO Max, HBO Go, HBO Now/HBO, DC Universe and Boomerang wait till you see what ViacomCBS is doing.

* **Streaming services with standalone DTC apps** and also available through Apple TV Channels, Prime Video Channels and/or The Roku Channel.
   * **CBS All Access** (flagship) - $5.99/mo for limited commercials, $9.99/mo for commercial free \[Not available through The Roku Channel\]
   * **Showtime** (DTC) - $10.99/mo
      * Apple TV+ subscribers (normally $4.99/mo after free trial) can subscribe to a special bundle of CBS All Access Commercial Free + Showtime for an additional $9.99/mo. The total bundle would cost you $14.99/mo for all three services.
      * For comparison CBS offers a standalone bundle of CBS All Access \[Limited Commercials\] + Showtime for $14.99/mo or CBS All Access \[Commercial Free\] + Showtime for $18.99/mo.
      * A CBS account can be linked with your Apple ID allowing complete access to the standalone CBS All Access app. Showtime content must be viewed within the Apple TV app.
   * **BET+** \- $9.99/mo - An extension of the BET brand featuring original programming and catalog content not found on the regular BET channels or Sho X BET. (Some catalog content shared with CBS All Access' BET hub.)
   * **Noggin** \- $7.99/mo - Essentially a streaming service featuring content from  Noggin/Nick Jr.
   * **Smithsonian Channel Plus** \- $4.99/mo (some content shared with CBS All Access' Smithsonian Channel brand hub.)
* **Exclusively on Apple TV Channels, Prime Video Channels and/or The Roku Channel**
   * **Comedy Central Now** \- $3.99/mo - Content from Comedy Central & TV Land (comedy shows like *Hot in Cleveland* and *Teachers* only) (Some content shared with CBS All Access' Comedy Central brand hub.)
   * **MTV Hits** \- $5.99/mo - Original content from MTV, VH1 & Logo (some content shared with CBS All Access' MTV brand hub.)
   * **NickHits** \- $7.99 - Nickelodeon shows (some content shared with CBS All Access' Nickelodeon brand hub.)
* **~~Exclusively available through WarnerMedia's VRV service~~**~~:~~
   * **~~NickSplat~~** ~~- $5.99/mo standalone or part of the VRV Premium Bundle ($9.99/mo) that also includes Crunchyroll Premium, HIDIVE, Boomerang, Rooster Teeth, and others.~~
      * ~~NickSplat features shows that currently airs (or previously aired) during TeenNick's NickRewind block. (Some content available on CBS All Access' Nickelodon brand hub.)~~
      * **\[Edit\]** Actually [this was removed as of August 28, 2020](https://help.vrv.co/hc/en-us/articles/360048881431-What-is-happening-with-Nicksplat-). I just realized this a moment ago when I went to watch a show on HIDIVE through VRV. However the content from NickSplat is also part of NickHits and some is also part of the Nickelodeon brand hub on CBS All Access.

I think that is all of ViacomCBS' streaming services (I hope)."

2213,2020-09-24 05:34:06,iyhp4m,"Yeah, I love the dynamic between Khalyla and Bobby. They’re definitely my favorite husband/wife (not actually married) podcast duo. They’re so different in every way from physical appearance, temperament, life experience, general knowledge of things, etc, that she’s the perfect foil for him. Visually the podcast is strangely appealing. It looks like a dirty candy store. And that’s what the show is — it’s that juxtaposition of manic wackiness and absolutely filthy stories. Bobby also has a funny rapport with so many different comics: Theo, D’Elia, Santino, Erik Griffin, etc. 

There are a couple of things I don’t like too. I disagree with their politics so I don’t like when they get political, unless they’re making jokes. I also dislike how fake they are sometimes: Bobby seemingly turned his back on D’Elia who did nothing wrong (especially compared to some of the shit Bobby claims he’s done); also they will sometimes be nice to a low-status guest and talk shit about them afterwards (Big Ed, I want to be Ninja lady)."

The other main Crazy Rich Asian actresses are still quiet about anti asian racism against elderly and young Asians while gaslighting Asians for not supporting Blacklivesmatter and never ever calling out White supremacy rhetoric. 

I wonder why that is?"

But many casinos have switched to blackjack rules that favor the house even more so that card counting may not be enough for you to actually win. And at the ones that haven't, they usually won't care if you're at a low limit table."
2281,2020-09-13 23:29:29,is94tt,no they only strongly encourage you to leave their etablissement

2285,2020-09-13 23:39:56,is94tt,"yeah well you kinda fell backwards into your answer. it barely works in the first place, it just gives you a edge that's about the same as just playing well... when you are alone. If you can do it with a group and coordinate, then you can really get an edge. that communication and coordination is what makes it cheating."
2286,2020-09-12 02:40:50,ir4j17,"they work those type of jobs purposely for hour flexibility. as a person who had his go in L.A. jobs like that while constantly having to get to an audition are so fitting.

As a small example, McDonald's has a fantastic training program, and upward mobility if you are motivated. The [CEO of Walmart started with the company unloading trucks.](https://www.businessinsider.com/ceos-started-entry-level-at-company-2019-7)"

Yeah, people who were born earlier will have better jobs IF they worked hard, becaude they are more experienced. This has always been the case. But you can be more experienced than people born after you, if you get these entry level jobs and move into a supervisor role to gain leadership experience. If you are really having a hard time, join the military; it's very high demand now and has guaranteed upward mobility and early retirement. 

I'm not dismissing the challenges, it is hard and takes time; not to mention life is unaffordable in many large cities. But get out of the big cities if you have to, and do whatever job you can find to the best of your ability. Good employees are hard to find, and if you make yourself invaluable you have a strong bargaining chip."
2295,2020-09-12 03:27:24,ir4j17,"What do you work as? Simple math, there are 56 million new people born each year, how many jobs do you hear being created every year? Less than a million, and people are living longer, those who are in a job are staying in it, don’t kid yourself..."

Sounds like I'm a generation ahead of you (millennial) so my friends and I went through exactly what you did not long ago. But now, I can't think of any friends who were motivated and worked hard who are not doing okay now. 

Now that I'm on the management side, I can tell you that good workers are very valuable. Be honest, reliable and work hard, and the company will work hard to keep you. If your company doesn't try to keep you, take your experience to another company."
2297,2020-09-12 03:54:03,ir4j17,"You edited your comment after I replied, so let me respond to this new one.

Where are you getting your numbers? Where were 56 million people born with only a million new jobs? China only had 14.6 million births.

Let's look at the US in 2019:

- US population grew 1.97 million, half from immigration (you need to factor in deaths and emmigration)) 


- Job growth was 1.16 million in 2019 

More importantly, since people born in 2019 aren't working until they are much older, the unemployment rate in the US in 2019 was 3.7%. 

Unemployment skyrocketted because of COVID to 14%, but is already down to 8% and is still going down and can be expected to go back to under 4%."
2298,2020-09-11 13:27:19,iqq6ac,"I love these movies too, I expected them to be really bad and oh my god, they’re so good. I can’t believe how funny and heart felt the second one is. I already loved Into the Jungle and The Next Level was even better. I’m really excited for the third one since they’re going to have Jumanji come to the real world this time

They teased it at the end of The Next Level and I called it in the theater a few minutes before that scene happened lol"
2299,2020-09-11 13:37:37,iqq6ac,I thought the first one was fine and the second one was unnecessary but i am glad you liked them this much.
2300,2020-09-11 14:55:08,iqq6ac,"Welcome to the Jungle is my favourite in the (admittedly pretty short) franchise. I’m honestly not head over heels in love with the original, so I’m glad they did their own thing. The action is great, the characters likeable and memorable, the main 4 are really charismatic and have great chemistry and there are a decent amount of laughs."
2301,2020-09-11 16:24:28,iqq6ac,"These movies made tons of money, even with both opening against (divisive) Star Wars films.  I don’t think it’s really an unpopular opinion that they’re good movies."
2302,2020-09-11 14:05:00,iqq6ac,"I normally don't like Jack Black,  but you could tell he was going for it."
2303,2020-09-11 16:29:21,iqq6ac,"Agreed.

I LOVED Welcome to the Jungle, and I was very excited for The Next Level. It did NOT disappoint me at all!"
2304,2020-09-11 16:31:03,iqq6ac,Welcome to the Jungle was good (even if a bit saltier than the original).  The Next Level sucked.  I almost expected Adam Sandler or Kevin James to make cameos.
2305,2020-09-11 17:08:33,iqq6ac,Awkwafina wasn’t good imo. But the 1st one is hillarious
2306,2020-09-11 17:27:58,iqq6ac,Do people really not like the new ones? I never knew about that!
2307,2020-09-11 19:08:17,iqq6ac,I hated Kevin Hart's performance in the 2nd one. Why was he trying to imitate speaking like Danny Glover? He did Kevin Hart's speaking and voice in the first one and didn't imitate the kid he was supposed to be. Why did it change so much the 2nd time around?
2308,2020-09-11 19:56:49,iqq6ac,"I've only seen the first new one but it was solid. Script, cast, the rock is in his element. Not unpopular at all. I was worried when it came out because the Jumanji world in the original was more terrifying because you never saw it, it was left to your imagination. And the new one was obviously just done in Hawaii or something."
2309,2020-09-11 20:29:11,iqq6ac,"In my opinion, the new ones are Sony's version of the Guardians of the Galaxy. Quippy, campy and downright hilarious. Plus, Karen Gillan stars in both Jumanji and Guardians!"
2310,2020-09-11 21:42:37,iqq6ac,"The original is not a classic. It was fine, but it wasn't something sacred like Back to the Future or Ferris Bueler."
2311,2020-09-11 22:23:26,iqq6ac,How many more Jumanjis we gonna have?
2312,2020-09-11 16:04:39,iqq6ac,I would say the new ones are funny but forgettable. Pretty standard action comedy. They are entertaining but that doesn't mean they are brilliant. Upvote for unpopular opinion lol
2313,2020-09-11 18:36:56,iqq6ac,"No all of them were stupid, plus the first one"
2314,2020-09-11 16:24:03,iqq6ac,They're awful
2315,2020-09-11 13:46:28,iqq6ac,"I was so much the same. I was so hesitant to watch the first one, but it was something to do and it turned out so brilliantly.

Finally got my housemate to watch the first one a couple of weeks ago so the we could watch the second. I was prepared for it to be as good as the first one, but no, it was sooo much better!

Honestly I'm a little frightened for a third, I don't know if they can keep this up, I saw the teaser and thought, no way they can do this again. But hey, they did so well the first two times.
Honestly the humour feels like 2% writing 98% perfectly casted actors, doing a fantastic job maybe we can even shoot for a forth?!"
2316,2020-09-11 15:41:56,iqq6ac,"100% agree. I thought they were just shameless cash grab. I watched the first one anyway and I totally loved it! Campy as hell and they know it. It’s just an entertaining movie that’s not trying to do anything else - not even trying to compete with the original. You can also tell the actors are having fun with their roles.

And the second one even managed to top the first movie!"
2317,2020-09-11 16:22:55,iqq6ac,He did awesome in both
2318,2020-09-11 13:52:44,iqq6ac,"I’m excited for the teens to get their spotlight in the next movie, they still had great scenes in the last two but I’m excited to see a full movie of just, them."
2319,2020-09-09 13:31:01,ipbwfy,"Obviously Trump was bad, I don’t remember Awkwafina or Amy Schumer being that bad. I remember a weird vibe with the Crowe and Hill episodes, with Jonah Hill it felt like he was done being an SNL host, like for years he was sully Jonah Hill which made him a fun host but now he didn’t want to be that. The only time he showed any enthusiasm was with Future. I think Charles Barkley is a special case, I like him and the stilted-ness he brings but I can see people automatically ranking that pretty low. J-Lo was my least favorite episode of the last season"
2320,2020-09-09 19:14:24,ipbwfy,"FYI, this website pulls IMDb episode ratings and puts them all into a grid format:

[https://theshowgrid.com/series/tt0072562/saturday-night-live-1975](https://theshowgrid.com/series/tt0072562/saturday-night-live-1975)

The all-time ""worst"" 10 list, including all 45 seasons is:

\#1 Donald Trump/Sia - 3.4 

\#2 Paris Hilton/Keane - 3.8

\#3 Pamela Anderson Lee/Rollins Band - 4.1

\#4 (TIE) Al Sharpton/Pink, Rosie O'Donnell/Whitney Houston - 4.2

\#5 (TIE) Chris Rock/The Wallflowers, Justin Bieber/Justin Bieber, Rosie O'Donnell/James Taylor - 4.3

\#6 (TIE) Ashton Kutcher/50 Cent, Tom Hanks/Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers - 4.5

\#7 Queen Latifah/Ms. Dynamite - 4.6

\#8 (TIE) Calista Flockhart/Ricky Martin, Nia Vardalos/Eve, Cuba Gooding Jr./Ricky Martin - 4.8

\#9 (TIE) Kelsey Grammar/Dwight Yoakam, January Jones/Black Eyed Peas - 4.9

\#10 (TIE) Awkwafina/Travis Scott, Ashton Kutcher/Gwen Stefani, Bill Pullman/New Edition, Scott Wolf/Natalie Imbruglia, Bernie Mac/Good Charlotte, Britney Spears/Britney Spears - 5.0

&#x200B;

Most of these seem like a case of review bombing IMDb based on who the host/musical guest is, rather than the actual content of the episode. I was surprised that nothing from the truly dire season 6 made the list, but that's probably because most of the hosts and musical guests they had that year are pretty obscure nowadays.

I'll come back later to post the ""best"" list if I have more time."
2321,2020-09-09 15:11:01,ipbwfy,John Mulaney's hosting debut in 2018 was pretty spectacular. I'd give it an 8.1
2322,2020-09-09 15:52:02,ipbwfy,This is oddly... accurate. Sterling K Brown’s episode feels like the only obvious snub to me
2323,2020-09-09 15:12:00,ipbwfy,"I put on the Felicity Jones episode for a friend who had never seen SNL before because we both liked Rogue One and I was watching the episode for the first time the Sunday after it aired.

We got some iconic sketches from his hosting, but we also got a lot of snoozer sketches that likely brought it down.  What were the musical guests?  

First hosting: Chris Stapleton (country never is a big hit with the SNL crowd, probably didn't help score); Kanye West (probably helped, but he's controversial); and Halsey (also probably helped his score)"
2326,2020-09-10 02:41:15,ipbwfy,"I'm a big Schumer fan and her episode wasn't terrible. It was just boring. What I was hoping would be a super funny, high-energy episode just sort of fizzled in a puddle in a parking lot."

2328,2020-09-09 08:21:59,ipbwfy,"Always take user scores with a grain of salt, because they are susceptible to brigading. It's possible Awkwafina has some negative reviews for unfair reasons.  I think at the time there were some angry that her entire shtick is appropriating black culture.  She was also arguably one of the least famous or relevant people to host the show and I guess some were butthurt either that the show doesn't have enough of an Asian representation or alternatively, they were angry that the show went out of it's way to find a ""token"" asian female host.

Then again, I haven't actually looked at the individual reviews.  I remember her episode being pretty ""meh"".  Some of the criticism was that she just played the same character she always plays in every sketch and that she was one-dimensional.

**EDIT:**  Pulled up [the reviews for that episode](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9064516/?ref_=ttep_ep2) and the first couple reviews confirmed my suspicions:

> ""I have no idea who the host was for the show, never saw her anywhere before and she didn't impress at all. I like diversity, but can we please get some talented artists?""

And:

> ""It was cringe worthy watching Awkwafina blatantly just read off the prompter while playing what seemed like the same unfunny character in all of her sketches."""
2329,2020-09-10 02:50:17,ipbwfy,"I remember his episodes as pretty Star Wars-heavy. You're right--there were some real snoozers. Also, while a whole lot of people love Star Wars, just as many viewers (if not more) haven't seen those movies. For those don't care about those films there are plenty of missed references and sketch premises that fall flat. 

Although when he played Pete Davidson's old oil man of a father I lost my shit."
2330,2020-09-09 08:25:18,ipbwfy,"Yeah, I wasn't considering the pile-on enough. Guess being here with relatively positive online fans, I forgot other online users just hate. 

I think Awkafina was famous by the time of her hosting because of *Crazy Rich Asians.* There have been quite a few hosts who were on the show rigjt after a break out like that."
2331,2020-10-27 00:50:22,ipbwfy,"I'm very late to this thread, but I don't think there were that many Star Wars sketches. The first and the third had the undercover boss ones, but other than that I don't really remember anything.

The one I don't understand is why his second episode is rated so low, but that has to because of Kanye's whole bizzare thing because looking at the sketches from that it's overall pretty good. It has one of the best cold opens in a long time with Matt Damon as Brett Kavanaugh, Coffee Shop is very good, and Career Day is one of my favourite sketches of all time just because of Driver's acting. Also as usual a good WU."
2332,2020-09-09 08:30:05,ipbwfy,"It's definitely more positive here.  What I remember about that episode was mostly that we had a flood of Asian pride in the discussion threads.  Asian folks who probably never actually watch SNL tuning in to show their support (which was cool... saw a similar thing when BTS was on)... and then subsequently there were a lot of complaints that the writing let her down and didn't showcase her talents enough.... while others would argue, ""uh... what talents?... she's some random girl who got YouTube famous from doing  a rap parody about her vagina""... 

It was probably more middle of the road than outright terrible, but I guess the episode brought in a lot of bickering."
2333,2020-11-01 03:03:02,ipbwfy,I definitely agree with you that the Damon cold open with him as Kavanaugh was exemplary

2355,2020-10-29 20:08:47,jkh8vy,Has there ever been an Asian-American film about sisterhood? This could be pretty interesting.
2356,2020-10-29 22:10:15,jkh8vy,im so ready to binge watch 🥰
2357,2020-10-30 05:35:29,jkh8vy,Ooh this sounds really good. I love both of them I'm so excited.
2358,2020-10-29 23:09:38,jkh8vy,wow! A netflix show featuring the greatest asian female actress of our generation and sandra oh.
2359,2020-10-31 02:46:41,jkh8vy,"I would love to see something like this! I'm so sick of romance and crime and all that. I want to see more stories about the mundane day to day of women's lives, women's friendships with each other, exploration into sisterhood both family wise and friend wise, mother daughter relationships etc., etc., etc."
2360,2020-10-30 04:01:34,jkh8vy,Lol sandra oh is awesome though
2361,2020-10-30 07:58:42,jkh8vy,She is! Killing eve is great!
2362,2020-10-31 02:39:54,jkh8vy,"Was, for a few episodes. Then it became the Villanelle show and all about Jodie Comer's awful overacting with Sandra getting nowhere near enough screen time and crappy lines."
2363,2020-10-29 19:23:25,jkf3qn,I think it’s called The Ferrell
2364,2020-10-30 01:09:32,jkf3qn,Does Awkwafina sleep?  I swear it feels like I'm hearing about a new project of hers constantly.
2365,2020-10-29 23:50:36,jkf3qn,"Sandra Oh has great comedic timing. I first saw her in the Princess Diaries, and she made a minor role really shine."

2367,2020-10-29 19:09:31,jkf3qn,I'm listening...
2368,2020-10-29 21:15:18,jkf3qn,Big age difference. I wonder if that will be relevant...
2369,2020-10-30 01:55:59,jkf3qn,Here for this.
2370,2020-10-29 22:26:05,jkf3qn,"Love  Awkwafina, her vag is just like an operatic ballad."
2371,2020-10-29 23:04:43,jkf3qn,"""Awkafina Is Nora From Queens"" was pretty fucking funny."
2372,2020-10-29 23:58:07,jkf3qn,"One's the square sister, and the other one is the wacko?

It'd be interesting if they played against type and had Awkwafina play the square and Sandra Oh play the crazy pothead lunatic."
2373,2020-10-30 00:09:13,jkf3qn,Hm. I don't really think they look anything alike. But I've known siblings like that. And maybe they'll be stepsiblings or something. But they're both great so I'm sure it'll be an awesome movie.

2383,2020-10-30 16:05:28,jkf3qn,I will watch this
2384,2020-10-29 21:02:28,jkf3qn,I love Sandra Oh so much I would watch this despite Awkwafina
2385,2020-10-29 22:54:32,jkf3qn,Why is her name Awkwafina? Is it a play on the water? Is she awkward? Whats the deal?
2386,2020-10-30 15:38:50,jkf3qn,every time I read Awkwafina I think of Akinfenwa.
2387,2020-10-30 20:20:51,jkf3qn,"Bobby Lee should be cast as their older brother. I’ll still most likely watch, but I’d 100% be down for this show if The Slept King was in it."

2389,2020-10-31 07:58:58,jkf3qn,Does Awkwafina have a real name?
2390,2020-10-30 01:24:47,jkf3qn,"Hey, this movie looks pretty goo-

*STARRING AWKWAFINA!!!*

Nvm."
2391,2020-10-30 00:49:40,jkf3qn,Complaining about Awkwafina’s name is so ancient. Do you guys live under a rock?
2392,2020-10-30 00:27:07,jkf3qn,oh good more awkwafina great
2393,2020-10-30 08:50:04,jkf3qn,But they look nothing like each other!
2394,2020-10-30 15:56:00,jkf3qn,Will watch.
2395,2020-10-29 22:05:14,jkf3qn,Holy shit that woman is so annoying and unfunny.
2396,2020-10-29 22:59:23,jkf3qn,Wow that woman has an awful name. Is she a rapper or something?
2397,2020-10-29 18:01:47,jkf3qn,They look nothing alike though...

2407,2020-10-30 01:16:54,jkf3qn,"She had a pretty minor role in Big Fat Liar as the teacher as well, and yet she still made it memorable, she was hilarious."
2408,2020-10-30 06:42:54,jkf3qn,"She also did rather well on *Arli$$*, especially given the quality of the scripts."
2409,2020-10-29 21:57:33,jkf3qn,"Only 17 years, that’s really not that big a deal. I have a sister who is 15 years older than me."
2410,2020-10-30 00:07:13,jkf3qn,Sandra looks like she can play younger and Awkwafina could play older if needed to make a smaller gap.
2411,2020-10-30 15:55:44,jkf3qn,It’s not like actors always play characters that are actually their own age. I’m sure the age difference will be smaller in story if their ages are ever explicitly mentioned.
2412,2020-10-29 23:28:52,jkf3qn,I have a half brother who is 18 years older than me and a nephew 1 year older.
2413,2020-10-30 17:49:36,jkf3qn,"maybe, but it’s not so apparent that a normal sibling relationship would be unbelievable. If you told me Awkwafina and Oh’s characters were both vaguely 30-something, I’d believe it."

2417,2020-10-30 04:34:47,jkf3qn,The k drama episode was a MASTERPIECE
2418,2020-10-30 17:52:26,jkf3qn,"Honestly, I kinda love them in those switched modes. Awkwafina in The Farewell was one of the best performances of last year, and Oh is an ultra-underrated comedic actress. She’s *so good* when she gets the chance to play wacky."
2419,2020-10-29 20:54:43,jkf3qn,"He's only on as a producer, which has been his strike zone for the past decade. Had a hand in Succession, Dead to Me, Hustlers, Drunk History, Booksmart, and more. (It's likely his name is just tacked on to sell investors & networks on projects from his production team - but again, the track record doesn't lie)"
2420,2020-10-29 22:10:54,jkf3qn,Have you watched Eurovision? It doesn't make up for Holmes and Watson but it's really good.
2421,2020-10-29 21:19:45,jkf3qn,"Have you seen The Farewell? She was really great in that and I think may change your perspective on her. If you already have seen it though, then to each their own. :)"
2422,2020-10-29 21:08:42,jkf3qn,I like both. Awkwafina has been refreshing and likeable in what she's been in.

2433,2020-10-29 18:37:31,jkf3qn,The age difference is bigger factor as they're more akin to mother and daughter
2434,2020-10-29 18:10:06,jkf3qn,Programme makers don't care about that anymore. Take a look at the sisters in The Walking Dead The World Beyond. They're not even the same racial group. Maybe it doesn't matter.
2435,2020-10-29 23:25:57,jkf3qn,That could be a band band Sunset Stepbrothers.

2446,2020-10-29 22:03:53,jkf3qn,I actually thought it was more for some reason! Probably because I've been seeing Sandra Oh for just so much longer. I looked it up only after making the comment.

2464,2020-10-30 01:53:47,jkf3qn,I can’t speak to personality irl but she’s been good in everything I’ve seen her in — especially when she’s not doing her usual shtick. She was phenomenal in The Farewell and I was pleasantly surprised by her voice role in the Dark Crystal prequel series; it’s nothing spectacular but still fun to see her doing something against type.

I love them to death but I feel like my role in their lives has definitely transitioned because I haven’t lived with them since they were very young. I also assume it will continue to change as they get older and start living an adult life, I image I would be a confidante at that point. Helping them figure out the stuff that I didn’t really get help figuring out. I’m super happy about that though because it means I get to be another person on their team and ready to help them succeed in the adult world."
2481,2020-10-30 15:30:19,jkf3qn,Anything more than a decade definitely makes a big difference. You're almost more an aunt/uncle than a sibling.

2488,2020-10-29 23:53:28,jkf3qn,Snl has its moments but it’s not the place to pass judgement on a guest star. Live scripted comedy is not everyone’s strong point. Try one of her movies or check out some of her music and if you still don’t like her so be it
2489,2020-10-29 22:03:36,jkf3qn,100% recommend The Farewell to any cinephile. She's great in it and it was one of the best movies of last year.

All same parents, we’ve got one dark skin, curly black hair, fair skin, darker straight brown hair, pale skin and dirty blonde, all different noses, different ears and face shapes... you get the idea.

2521,2020-10-29 00:54:18,jk0d8o,Shang Chi has had zero marketing
2522,2020-10-29 03:37:08,jk0d8o,"I dunno, I don't think the Shang Chi marketing has started up yet, marvel's always been quite hush hush while filming so you don't even have any behind the scene photos or clips to drive up the hype. Plus people are unfamiliar with Shang Chi over all and the Mandarin is a racist caricature in the comics so maybe people are waiting to see how it turns out? 

Shang Chi also is suppose to be a ringer for Bruce Lee and Simu Liu doesn't really look like him? But I read Simu Liu used to be a stuntman so his background seems to be an okay fit. There's also the fact that Simu Liu doesn't have any movie or shows shown in China so there's no established fan base to help hype up his casting in the first place.

Plus Iron Man 2 had that two version clusterfuck as well (the one shown in China had all scenes with Chinese actors that felt tacked on, the Chinese actors didn't show up in the international version at all). So I think it's all just wait and see rather than no hype at the moment."
2523,2020-10-29 10:37:40,jk0d8o,"Its quite normal before a new superhero is introduced , guardians was the biggest example of that"
2524,2020-10-29 01:22:54,jk0d8o,"Shang Chi is a F-List hero* that nobody will probably know about until they see the film itself, so it's hard to get excited about something most regular non-movie or comic savvy people have heard of yet.

*I know the argument has been made that ""So was X and Y character"" but between Captain America, Deadpool, Black Panther or even the TV characters like the Inhumans or the Defenders, Shang Chi is legitimately an full on obscure character that hasn't been featured in many comic books, merchandise, clothing, brand marketing and action figures except for incredibly sporadic, brief or limited appearances."
2525,2020-10-29 10:40:42,jk0d8o,"Yes this is an asian superhero movie but marvel is not doing to break the asian records or to please them . It is just another feather of marvel like black panther and marvel doesn't depend only on asian markets even though its an asian centric film just like black panther did 
So marvel will be fine even if it does normal box office in every market"
2526,2020-10-29 23:36:27,jk0d8o,"Awkwafina is a terrible choice... I really don't think her looks/demeanour appeals to east Asians at all. I mean,s he does fine as supporting comedy actor like in Jamanji, but seriously to have her cast as the main female role? Ouch"
2527,2020-10-29 01:23:25,jk0d8o,"When they release the first trailer, the hype will go from zero to Sen."
2528,2020-10-29 01:35:23,jk0d8o,"American movies, even when about other cultures or countries, tend to be wholy self-centered so that might be a point of contention. Might as well watch a truly American movie than one that pretends to be about your part of the world, you got a thousand local movies for that. 

Marvel's Black Panther for example for all it's talk about Africa really had nothing to do with that part of the world beyond some aesthetic choices. It was almost insulting how little that movie was interested in African issues."
2529,2020-10-29 02:14:33,jk0d8o,"The main marketing point so far is Asian superhero playing kungfu, not so much to hype about"
2530,2020-10-29 07:12:09,jk0d8o,"Wait, they are excited for Dune?"
2531,2020-10-29 12:19:03,jk0d8o,"Chang-Chi's standalone comic ended in 1983 and the character didn't get another long running standalone till 2017! after a 34 year gap.

In that 34 year long gap 26 issues where released across 6 limited series."
2532,2020-10-29 14:46:01,jk0d8o,"East Asian don't really care about hollywood movies with asian characters. Japan (since 1950's), Hong Kong, Korea already had well developed movie industry for decades. Black Panther marketing is not going to work in this region. Movie is still going to do well because it is MCU but not because they had Asian characters."
2533,2020-10-29 01:03:57,jk0d8o,"I think you pretty much mentioned it. People in china no that its a movie meant to pander to them so to speak. 1) the problem is that simu and awkwafina do not appeal to chinese beauty standards. 2) chinese don't care about representation. to america a majority asian cast is celebrated, in china its tuesday. 3) shang chi is a martial artist, do you know how many martial artist movies/tv china produces? alot. at least characters like thor, iron man, CAP are unique. 4) characters history. the western raised asian is good guy, eastern raised is bad. theres probably more, but can't think of any.

i think Shangi chi will not perform nearly is as well as BP, but i think it will perform like an average MCU film(~600 mil). It will perform similar to crazy rich. One question i have for the audience. **if Shang-chi performs like antman and fails to blowup like BP/capt marvel. will that be seen as a failure?** I personally think so."
2534,2020-10-29 10:51:48,jk0d8o,I also think the hype for chi is low but we'll see when the trailer arrive. I can see it doing 700-800M range
2535,2020-10-29 03:24:49,jk0d8o,true. i've always said that BP was made for african americans. it simply used african aesthetics.
2536,2020-10-29 01:55:45,jk0d8o,"
>**if Shang-chi performs like antman and fails to blowup like BP/capt marvel. will that be seen as a failure?** I personally think so.

Sure, a DC_cinematic fanatic should judge that a Marvel movie is a failure even if it makes big profit.

Warner and DC would literally kill to have their D-list superhero movie get $600 million.

Just like when their extremely popular A-list DC villain Harley Quinn get that $600 million, right?

Oh wait...."
2537,2020-10-29 04:07:56,jk0d8o,"African-Americans = Americans, black Americans if race is relevant to the discussion. Precisely because they mostly have no relation to Africa except far-away origin that term has always been weird for us from outside of the US, borderline offensive imo.
I of course get what you mean, just saying."

”During the [Ming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_Dynasty) and [Qing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_Dynasty) dynasties, Wen Wu temples were patronised by those seeking success in the [Imperial examinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_examinations), which were divided into civil and military examinations, and by those seeking advancement in professions which could be interpreted as falling under the aegis of one of the gods. Thus, to the present day, **civil servants** make offerings to the civil god, and policemen to the martial god.”

2583,2020-12-12 17:13:08,kbs0k3,"First of all, you say that the elderly keeping the information from the young is a more universal idea. No, it's not. Reason 1 being, this is not a movie taking place in the West. The idea the director is exploring is a very Eastern cultural concept. You can do your research into this, but the movie also spells it out for you multiple times. Reason 2 is that the elderly have a greater fear of death since they're nearer it. Hiding the idea of death from the elderly more than the younger generations is more universal even if it weren't for the Eastern viewpoint because the fear of death is the most universal fear.

Next, the movie is the story of the director and her grandmother. It's a true story, so changing it wouldn't reflect the actual experience. 

Now, I'm not saying you're wrong that you liked it more, and maybe from a Western storytelling perspective you are correct that this change would ""improve"" the tragedy, but there was more to the movie than that."

Do you mean Lulu Wang?"
2586,2020-12-12 18:19:53,kbs0k3,"Hard to say if it would necessarily improve the movie, but it would certainly make it more overtly parabolic. 

I’d say part of the beauty of the movie is it’s honesty and commitment to just telling a true story. Or it felt that way for me.

Still, this was a cool read and I think it adds to the discussion to consider how the story could be changed with such a small change."

And of course I disagree that it makes the ending better. The ending is tragic exactly because the grandma doesn’t know, she treats it as any other farewell.

I mean your whole premise doesn’t even make sense. If they give her the medical report that says she has cancer, and then she lies, to all of them, and says she’s fine, they would confront her. This “better” plot change is shit, and would totally uproot the entire story to conform to it."

I think that is at the heart of your post. The cultural debate this initiated is a conversation worth having for sure, but you're getting crucified by some of these people and that's ridiculous. 

Sure it may be a bit arrogant to message the director or say this theoretical version is ""better"", but it's definitely interesting and I like the enthusiasm. Certainly gave me something to think about."
2597,2020-12-12 16:57:49,kbs0k3,"Since this has a few upvotes meaning at least someone sees it, spend 15 minutes today and go back and watch the ending from 1:23 onwards and I know you'll agree with me."
2598,2020-12-12 17:46:40,kbs0k3,">First of all, you say that the elderly keeping the information from the young is a more universal idea. No, it's not.

I'm going to have to disagree with you on this point. People hiding their illness from family  is absolutely universal. Across all cultures it has been a trope of the inward struggle on whether to tell others about bad news or keep it internal in order to not ruin the mood.

That is why this movie was so interesting as it introduces the western audience to the unique Eastern concept which is the exact opposite situation as usually encountered: keeping your loved one's illness from themselves for their own happiness. It's still a lie about health, but it also plays with questions of consent because you're lying to the person who has the medical condition. I think this is the struggle that Lulu Wang obviously had while visiting her grandma in China and taking part in this Eastern concept.

What I'm saying is that both situation, both East and West, have the same overall question; Is it better to lie to keep someone ""blissfully ignorant"". My particular tweak of the story merges the two concepts (East and West way of lying about illness) and brings them together for a deeper discussion. I understand that it is a true story, so obviously this is just a discussion on ""what if"" and not a discussion on changing the past.

Thanks for your opinion! I just needed to talk about this with someone!"
2599,2020-12-13 02:28:05,kbs0k3,But Deadpool would walk in!!!!!!!!!!
2600,2020-12-12 19:02:17,kbs0k3,Edited. I actually did message Lulu Wang with no response ha!
2601,2020-12-12 20:15:37,kbs0k3,"In my scenario the whole family knows she's lying, but they have to continue the lie because the grandma has now chosen to lie and keep the family in the dark to the disease (in her eyes). Telling her that they know already would 1. Show they already knew and have been lying and 2. Make her feel bad and force her to face her nearing mortality with goodbyes/discussion. So even though EVERYONE now knows the truth, the lie is still forced to perpetuate. It's all in this futile attempt to make the other side feel better in ""blissful ignorance"". 

Billi was just delivering the report. If I was having a family member bring me my medical report I wouldn't assume that they peaked inside and invaded my privacy."
2602,2020-12-12 19:01:37,kbs0k3,"Woah I'm not saying to change any characters or races. All I'm saying is that this tweak adds another LAYER to the story. The whole plot still stands on exploring the Eastern tradition of withholding bad news from the elderly, there's just another layer in the end exploring the grandma doing it back to them. If anything I think it normalizes the Eastern tradition for the western audience by bringing in a perspective that they can relate to.

Surely you don't think that Chinese elderly haven't lied about their illnesses to their family? It's a HUMAN condition, not a cultural one. Struggling with your own mortality and not wanting to burden loved ones with it. I'm honestly thinking it's more insensitive for you to think that the cultures are THAT different that it doesn't happen in China too.

That was my bad in a rushed typing since she's the protagonist. Edited. I actually did message Lulu Wang with this idea with no response lol."
2603,2020-12-12 20:46:10,kbs0k3,Ha thanks. Lesson 1: Don't try to change movies people like!
2604,2020-12-12 17:54:34,kbs0k3,"Again though, you’re talking about a universal inward struggle in western storytelling, whereas this movie is depicting something that happens regularly in the East in real life. I’m not saying hiding illness isn’t universal, but in the East it’s different due to the group culture that is more pervasive. 

Also I don’t think we need to tweak a specific story to merge eastern and western concepts. The movie wanted to explore the eastern one and doesn’t need to make it friendlier to western audiences if it didn’t want to."
2605,2020-12-12 19:52:26,kbs0k3,"So you--a random person with no connection to Lulu Wang--messaged her with completely unsolicited advice about how to ""improve"" her already well-regarded, award-winning film? In the hopes that she would... what?  

Dude, its one thing to post little what-if's on reddit for fun discussion, but that is the height of arrogance."
2606,2020-12-12 21:37:45,kbs0k3,But if Billie knows she's lying Why would she of all people keep up the lie?
2607,2020-12-12 20:11:31,kbs0k3,"I still can’t tell if you understand this story actually happened to Lulu Wang. 

I’m guessing your message went something like:
“Hey Lulu Wang your true story doesn’t have universal appeal, here’s a change that would fundamentally change every theme investigated within it so I, a non Chinese-American, would be more comfortable with it — no I’m not incapable of understanding other cultures I’m being universal!”"
2608,2020-12-12 20:51:53,kbs0k3,"No, the lesson is don't be an egotistical little shit."
2609,2020-12-13 02:47:51,kbs0k3,consider that it might be because the proposed change has some problems with it not just because people are mad you're changing something they like. I'm all for a good change to something I like but I dont think your change helps the movie i think it actively hurts it.
2610,2020-12-12 18:49:57,kbs0k3,I really want to second this and add that the differences between east and west are a major theme in Billi's story. To make it 'more universal' seems to defeat the purpose of so much of the movie.
2611,2020-12-12 19:32:38,kbs0k3,"The best way I can describe the change is that it adds another layer to the story. I don't feel that it takes anything away from the existing plot points.

I mean at some point her grandma either learns the news or she dies without ever knowing.  I think the confrontation with her learning the news within the film adds to the story. And the fact that she immediately flips the premise of the film back on the family is a nifty and more compelling story.

I feel like people are arguing that the change I've proposed is bad because it changes the movie (and therefor isn't the true story). If we're working on that premise then the whole discussion is moot because the plot will always be in its best form as-is."
2612,2020-12-12 20:07:53,kbs0k3,I was googling for a The Farewell subreddit and her AMA was the top result. No skin off my back to copy my post and edit it into a message hoping for a comment. You must never have bought a lottery ticket.
2613,2020-12-12 20:39:48,kbs0k3,"As I said in another comment, if we're starting on the premise that true stories are best as-is, then the whole discussion is moot. I'm just proposing a ""what if"" scenario and comparing two stories side by side.

Am I crazy in thinking there were HUMAN themes in this movie, not just cultural ones? Suffering, Truth, Lies, Happiness, Familial Connection, Cultural Connection, Consent. Lulu Wang wasn't just showing us a Chinese tradition; she was wanting us to experience the philosophical and moral questions that came with it. All I'm saying is that the grandma finding out about her illness and still perpetuating ""The Lie"" that everything is just fine adds an interesting twist, and I wanted to know if anyone else agreed.

You seem very upset about my comments on the movie and I hope it eases your mind a bit knowing that I loved the movie and have recommended it to friends. I'm just playing with a hypothetical and you seem to have taken it personally."
2614,2020-12-12 20:20:29,kbs0k3,"The fuck is wrong with you going off like that? All he did was share an interesting idea he had from watching this movie. Just because this movie is based on a true story (which it definitely didn't have to be, it could've just been a fictional story) doesn't mean he's shitting all over her life."
2615,2020-12-12 21:06:09,kbs0k3,Yikes!
2616,2020-12-13 05:45:53,kbs0k3,I would hope not because If you think it's okay to go off on someone like that because you think his version of the story wouldn't have been as compelling than you have serious issues.
2617,2020-12-12 19:37:48,kbs0k3,You’re still ignoring the point about western vs eastern storytelling/culture. Your idea about this making the plot better is purely opinion based so I can’t argue that. But you need to look at it culturally. What you want is for a movie to explore Western themes when it is setting out to explore Eastern themes.
2618,2020-12-13 02:11:48,kbs0k3,"It’s just pure arrogance to believe you have anything to contribute to the director’s telling of a very personal story. The movie doesn’t need this change, nor does it benefit from the edits you’ve suggested. The film is very personal to the director so the way it’s presented is intentional and meaningful. To suggest any sort of change is disregarding the artistry and personal nature of the story. It’s nothing like a lottery ticket. There is a 0% chance the director will ever find what you’ve said to be anything less than patronizing and foolish."
2619,2020-12-12 20:43:28,kbs0k3,I'm glad you refuse to have any introspection on why people are downvoting you and disagreeing with you. Have a good one.

2624,2020-12-13 05:43:51,kbs0k3,"For God's sake it's a movie. She made her very personal story into a fictionalized version for the big screen already and we're not allowed to discuss the plot points? Would we be obligated to praise the movie even if it was garbage as well because it's her own life story?

Yes the idea of emailing her to suggest this change is ridiculous on account of it being based on a true story but going off like the guy I'm responding to did to someone politely sharing their idea on something is not okay behavior. The story could just as well have been like the one OP proposed, it would've made a lot of sense, and you're not an arrogant cunt for thinking it could've made the story more compelling."
2625,2020-12-12 21:24:27,kbs0k3,Yeah dude that's gonna be a big fucking yikes from me as well
2626,2020-12-13 08:43:38,kbs0k3,"I considered your comment to be excusing other people going off on OP in this thread, not that yours were. I would have no problem with you or anyone else saying ""nah that idea is pretty bad to be honest"" but what we have is more in the line of ""How fucking dare you suggest this you egotistical arrogant FUCK, this is her LIFE you are talking about you insufferable close-minded little shit"" which is, you know, maybe a little bit much and pretty inexcusable behavior."
2627,2020-12-12 20:14:05,kbs0k3,"It's not a strictly western dilemma, that's not what I mean. But this idea of hiding your own illness applies to western culture as well whereas hiding the illness from the ill is not a western idea. 

What you are saying is that you would rather have an additional plot point to make the film more accessible to western audiences. And even if that is not your intention, I think there is some subconscious bias there. The director wanted to explore what she wanted. We don't need her to make everyone in the west comfortable with their own held beliefs so she can make a movie about something more unfamiliar to us."
2628,2020-12-12 21:28:18,kbs0k3,"I'm sorry, I'm not clear on why I'm supposed to be invested in your opinions of me.

2630,2020-12-12 20:23:15,kbs0k3,"Yes, perhaps saying it's more universal, or more relatable for a wider audience was the wrong word choice. Really I just like that it prods more (and at a different angle) at the philosophical question of lying about illness and suffering that lie ""for the greater good"". 

Maybe I just like a good twist and that's why I like my change! Thanks for taking the time to discuss."

I'm just saying to look at it from the perspective of the culture it comes out of, and 1) why making that change doesn't make it objectively better, and 2) why a director would make a choice that is less ""universal"".

2638,2020-12-12 17:59:26,kbrprt,"It's a great movie with an amazing soundtrack to match. 

Yes your question is brought out in the movie by the protagonist who is an American-raised Chinese woman, visiting her grandma back in China. Lots of questions either directly or indirectly come up as you watch. Doesn't someone have the right to know that they're going to die soon? Doesn't she have the right to say goodbye? Does the lie result in more suffering than it prevents? Is the truth always better?

I don't have any issue with the movie as-is, but that little tweak ties it back with another common lie about illness and I think adds another layer to the story.

Let me know what you think after you watch!"

I can't believe this woman. She's the first Asian American actress to ever win best actress at the Golden Globes, all because of a movie about an Asian American girl's non-stereotypical experience with Chinese culture. And I looked at the credits on IMDB, its not some White writer that the producers shoehorned in and forced Awkwafina to go along with, less they cancel the show. **She and her Asian co-writer, wrote the fucking episode!**

No wonder the only time she's ever talked about Anti-Asian racism since the whole pandemic started was when ChinaMac pressured her into it. How could she with good conscience call herself Asian, pimping Chinese culture to get critics and awards claim in one piece of media, and creating another piece of media confirming every White dude's biases about China? 

Well, its worked. Women's got a bright career ahead of her. Its fine, we all got to eat, go and collect your paychecks.

She brought up outdated, racist tropes on the Bobby Lee podcast, saying how Bobby must got that love from his parents simply because he was a boy, not knowing that Bobby and his brother were beaten so badly that his brother called social services on their parents.

It is perfectly fine that she is a sellout. The vast majority of Asian female celebrities are. But I wish they would give Asian males their **personal space**. These AF""s hate, won't date, won't cast Asian men, but they will still use them as stepping stones. 

Awkwafina and Constance Wu are hiding their white boyfriends until they go full mainstream.

So these two are the AF's that represent the Asian community with movies like Shang-Chi and Crazy Rich Asians, that AM's should be proud of. However, it is all a facade."
2662,2020-12-12 09:27:36,kb7j8n,"I feel like a lot of people here already have similar sentiments but I honestly cannot relate to *a lot* of the prominent Asian Americans actors/politicians out there like Constance Wu, Awkwafina, Andrew Yang, Lucy Liu, and pretty much the majority of the well-known ""boba liberal"" activists (you know who they are). 

The majority of them grew up in upper income class, as with their parents who imimgrated to the US very early on and also graduated with degrees from prestigious universities. Hence, a lot of these parents also don't enforce their American/Western-born kids to even speak their own language (I've also seen this in real life; not just celebrities) and can just survive by speaking English to their kids in the household. 

So I already can't relate to them at all as my parents have never even set foot within a schoolground and are basically illiterate even within their own language. I grew up not knowing what a family income was and lived within a low income but multicultural community; and speaking mainly chinese at home because I have no choice but to (and I actually do enjoy it). I don't have anyone to guide me when it comes to financial or career making decisions and when I make these decisions it will never affect boba liberals but how they choose to represent ""Asians"" on screen/media will be detrimental to people like me. 

Very often the type of Asian americans seen on media where they openly say asians are ""priviledged/racist/live in a bubble"" are the ones I'm talking about above. Do they as Asians in west realise that asians like me also exist? When they call asians ""priviledged and racist"" are they talking about themselves? Because my parents are far from that description, we have always been respectful to people of other cultures and wouldn't have it any other way. The way Asian activists selectively choose to represent Asians affects people like me and my livelihood, not to mention it is also completely false.

As an AF, I honestly relate more to Mila Kunis and that's saying something about the awful representation we have. I honestly couldn't care about seeing ""my face"" in the media，If their values aren't the same or portrayed awfully then I don't feel represented no matter how many Asians that are crammed into one movie/tv show.

Edit: The ones I can only ""relate"" to are Harry Shum Jr; Simu Liu; Chris Pang; Asian Youtubers and all the asian american actors who went to Asia to find work."
2663,2020-12-12 04:56:00,kb7j8n,"honestly, this is expected of pretty much all asian-american female celebrities..... Only the males are the ones who truly support asians. 

im not tryna cause a divide here. But let's face the truth. There's clearly a divide between males and females in the asian american community. I honestly think asian american females actively destroy and undo the work that the males put in, and they are pretty much the reason why our progress is stagnated... Seriously, compare this to black female celebrities who vehemently support black issues. The difference is mind-blowing."
2664,2020-12-12 05:05:26,kb7j8n,"She's a sell out. These people aren't in it for Asians, they support the structure of white people more than white people."

2666,2020-12-12 01:13:36,kb7j8n,"look at what she is doing...her career has skyrocketed.  now she is in the new Shang Chi movie with Simu Liu and mostly likely his love interest. what a joke. we finally get a Asian male superhero and they cast her as his love interest? that is a slap in the face to Simu...instead of getting a highly attractive woman as his partner like his white counterparts...they decide on Awkwafina who is below average at best? intentional no doubt.

if Shang Chi becomes a massive hit...the success will also benefit her greatly. and then she will gladly shill for whites whenever she feels like it and come back to being Asian again when that doesn't work out.

proud of her roots my ass 

anyway who watches her shitty comedy show? hope it goes down in flames."

But to play devil's advocate here, she's in an industry that will drop you without a care in the world, if you are deemed to be too problematic or too political favouring the wrong side, especially if you're a POC. It's a hard line to tow, do you choose your career, something you've worked so hard just for a chance to get your foot in the door, or do you defend your ancestry, at the expense of your career?"
2671,2020-12-12 06:32:17,kb7j8n,"I'm actually not sure I agree with this take. For one thing, her show has some very positive portrayals of AM (Simu Liu and Harry Shum are both in one episode). For another thing, I feel like the episode the reviewer is describing was more about mocking white guys who go to China. Finally, the guy mentions the Cultural Revolution episode, I feel like that episode was really mocking the boba liberals who exaggerate how tough their families had it in the ""old country"" to appeal to whities. I kind of feel like the whole show is actually subverting and mocking the shit out of annoying AsAm boba liberal types.

She's also saying fuck you to all those AF who are desperate to be some white guy's lotus flower by being like ""haha I'm a disgusting and weird as shit AF, I'm not some lotus flower, haha""... which I'm sure is pissing off quite a few Lu's, so I respect her for that."

Awkwafina isn't even full-on Chinese American (she's part Korean), but she needs to dump on China in her show to build mainstream credibility.

Remember when Andrew Yang called on all Asians to show their patriotism while getting hatecrimed back in March/April?  That was just practical advice.  That's what it takes now for Asian Americans to show we belong to this country that is already ours.  

Get used to being treated like Muslims after 9/11.

What matters is how she is representing this community and is that in a positive way. I think she is better than, say, somebody like Celeste Ng or Ken Jeong who have done absolutely nothing positive and done negative work for our community. Awkwafina is still paying lip service and saying something about asian representation, and her pro-asian narrative is by no means mainstream enough yet for us to afford being able to attack her for ancillary reasons. The criticism being levied on her is sinocentric, I think bigger picture, the positives for asian americans outweigh the negatives."
2684,2020-12-12 11:39:56,kb7j8n,"I feel the same way as you. I often feel like there's a fight for the narrative of Asian America. With other groups, they're viewed as whole people with their own stories. With us, it feels like we can't escape that and often our own tries to box us in by writing narratives about how our phd educated parents force us to play the piano and think that's all Asian America"

So being so quick to discredit her over this is too much. That being said, she’s one of the many Asian American artists that I just can’t relate to with regards to my identity. This isn’t necessarily a problem I have with her personally but the media’s deliberate selective representation for us."

She needed approval of white people and I guess a lot of Asians who grew up here were probably like that.. To a lot of these Asian Am/Cdns the only way to be cool was to denigrate of our Chinese background.

I’ve been treated as a stupid foreigner, a talent foreigner, just another local who doesn’t speak English, a local who somehow doesn’t speak mandarin.

I’ve met some very talented foreigners, and some who had absolutely zero business doing what they were doing, getting paid what they were getting paid, and I feel zero remorse saying that it’s because they’re quite.

I’ve met some locals who couldn’t give a shit about foreigners, who hated foreigners, who loved foreigners and preferred their company over fellow nationals, who hated everyone and but also appropriated the shit outta western and black America culture.

Danny Haiphong

Editor's Note: This article was originally published in Black Agenda Report, December 2, 2020.

In recent years, the corporate media has invested significant resources in programming that appeals to younger members of the liberal class who are growing increasingly frustrated by their circumstances in the United States. Movements such as the struggle for immigrant rights, Occupy Wall Street, and Black Lives Matter have forced media corporations to include themes of “inclusion,” “diversity,” and the growing poverty of millennials on their streaming platforms. Shows such as Lovecraft Country, Shameless, and Dear White People all tap into the economic and social unrest of the current period. Awkwafina is the most well-known artist to emerge from a new drive to promote the Asian American and immigrant experience in the corporate media. Her new program Awkwafina Is Nora From Queens, however, is a testament to the powerful interests that media monopolies and their employed artists possess in the racist New Cold War on China spearheaded by the Pentagon.

The relationship between the Pentagon and corporate media is hardly a secret. A large number of media corporations are owned by General Electric, one of the U.S.’ top weapons producers. Recent documents supplied by the Pentagon and the CIA in a FOIA request show that the U.S. military has been directly involved in the production of over 800 movies and 1,000 television programs. Programs such as Jack Ryan overtly promote U.S. interventionism in countries such as Venezuela with help from the CIA. In the last four years of Russiagate, a series of films and television programs have complimented the constant corporate news coverage of the conspiracy to paint Russia as an enemy of the United States.

Perhaps more dangerous is the subtle way that “progressive” programming normalizes U.S. militarism with Cold War politics. Awkwafina Is Nora From Queens provides a case in point. In the show, Awkwafina plays herself—a Chinese American woman in her late twenties navigating the Chinese experience in the U.S. and the economic and social realities of her generation. Many of the characters in the program possess a modicum of charm; that is, if one can stomach the obvious anti-communist references in episodes such as Grandma and Chill. In the season finale, however, the liberal mask comes off and the program morphs into a screed for the U.S.’ New Cold War on China.

The first season ends with Awkafina moving to China after she and her cousin sell the rights of their app, Scrubr, to Chinese investors. The rest of the episode is a stream of racist stereotypes of China that align perfectly with the U.S.’ New Cold War agenda. Chinese tech corporations are portrayed as dependent on Awkwafina’s “American face” to sell products. The popular Chinese app WeChat is featured on the show to comfort American audiences with the propaganda that censorship is rampant in China. Awkwafina’s difficult adjustment to her new home is highlighted with a scene of her eating KFC in Beijing and spending all of her free time with European and American expats. China is cast as a playground for the U.S. and West with few redeeming qualities of its own that are worthy of attention.

In an interview for the New York Daily News last year, Awkwafina heralded the progress of the corporate media in challenging racist stereotypes of Asian-Americans. “I think the industry is moving toward a good spot where Asian people are seen now as people that can do other things,” she said. “I think when you first start out and you’re an artist, you want to be just known as an artist. You don’t want to have to be pigeonholed.” Apparently, these words do not apply to countries such as China facing endless smears from the American empire. Awkwafina’s assistant, Grace, is the prototype of racist stereotypes of Chinese women. She is docile, subservient, and sheltered from the glamourous life offered by the Western world. Awkwafina exposes Grace to heavy partying and helps her obtain a promotion at the tech corporation before being deported back to the U.S. for taking the fall for Grace’s illegal drug use.

One comes out of watching the season finale of Awkwafina is Nora from Queens with the idea that China is a repressive surveillance state incapable of any achievements beyond what is gifted to the country from the U.S. and West. China’s ascendance as a global power is mostly window dressing. Modern apartments are furnished with uncomfortable ameneities. Chinese workers like Grace are nothing more than modern-day slaves working 24-7 to serve Americans. Chinese tech corporations need Awkwafia, a twenty-seven-year-old millennial with no job experience, to succeed in the global market. In a word, China and its people are inferior to the United States’ way of life. American arrogance was quite literally on fully display, not least because the episode was filmed in Taiwan without the permission of the local government.

Awkwafina could have taken a more balanced approach to China by considering the following trends:

China leads the world in patent applications, with tech giant Huawei filing the most patents per company for the third consecutive year in 2019.
China leads the world in the production of renewable energy and has committed to becoming a carbon neutral country by 2060. Economists believe that the Chinese market for electric vehicles may render oil production itself obsolete.
Women’s participation in the workforce has doubled since 1978. Nearly a quarter of all representatives in the National People’s Congress (NPC), China’s highest political body, are women.
Wages in China rose by ten percent from 2018 to 2019.
On November 23rd of this year, China declared victory in its fight against absolute poverty.
These are just a few achievements which have imbued a remarkable trust among the Chinese people in the capacity of the government in China to address their needs. The Harvard Ash Center surveyed satisfaction with the central government in China and found that nearly 95.5 percent of respondents were “relatively satisfied” or “highly satisfied” with its performance. Contrast this with a recent Gallup poll that revealed just 38 percent of people in the U.S. are satisfied with the performance of the U.S. government. The negation of China’s achievements and the erasure of the U.S.’ woes are a staple of New Cold War racism. Economic insecurity and the uncontrolled spread of COVID-19 have made it essential for U.S. political and media elites to emphasize to the masses of Americans that China is in fact to blame for their problems.

That Awkwafina fell into the trap of parroting New Cold War racism should not surprise anyone who understands just who and what the corporate media serves. Huey P. Newton’s statement that he did not expect the white media to create positive Black male images also applies to nations targeted by the U.S. war machine. No amount of representation from oppressed groups and nationalities changes the fact that the corporate media primarily caters to white investors and audiences. Awkwafina in particular focuses attention on the tastes of the white liberal class. Her program Awkwafina is Nora from Queens demonstrates that this class has a large stake in the racist New Cold War on China being pursued in the halls of power in Washington D.C.

Some may view Awkwafina’s venture into the realm of anti-China stereotypes to be inconsequential to the overall geopolitical landscape. Such a posture negates the fact that racism toward Asian Americans has intensified in the U.S. in conjunction with a massive anti-China propaganda campaign led by the corporate media from the very outset of China’s battle with COVID-19 in Wuhan. New Cold War stereotypes are racist in character and help justify hostile U.S. policies toward China. Corporate media has long served the function of creating the ideological foundation for U.S. wars abroad. Awkwafina shouldn’t get a pass, and neither should anyone else."

2805,2020-12-12 01:38:24,kb1fm5,"Probably gonna be down-voted, but I'm holding my breath on Phase 5. Not really as optimistic as everyone else. I've always been selective when it comes to Marvel films more than others, my favorites only really limited to Captain America films and Infinity War (Endgame was... ""alright"").

My bigger concern is towards Daredevil and whether if he will be included at all. So far, from Feige's announcement, there's no announcement, so that doesn't bode well for the future of the Man with No Fear. But it's perhaps for the best - not really confident about Disney's capability of handling material as gritty as Daredevil anyway.

Speaking of gritty material Disney might have trouble dealing with, Moon Knight has often been cited as ""Marvel's Batman"" for good reasons. His ambiguous morality reminds me of Punisher, another violent and mentally unsound antihero that probably won't see the light of day in Disney+ any time soon either. So yeah, when ""Moon Knight"" was announced in Feige's announcement video, I definitely had a lot of doubts there.

Spider-Man being introduced to the multiverse and other Spider-Men at last... As a Raimi Spider-Man fan, I should be more excited about this... But unfortunately, I just can't get myself to feel excited. It's like, I appreciate the sentiment of acknowledging Tobey Maguire and all, but could we just focus on more personal stuff for Peter now? I wasn't a big fan of Homecoming, but Spider-Man has always been more about personal issues for Peter related to his family and friends, a soap opera really, so Homecoming, in spite of pandering to Iron Man, was coming from the right place. It's one reason why I felt an adult Spider-Man would've been more preferable to tackle adult issues someone of my age could relate to instead of highschool problems that I've outgrown.

But can't complain, I guess. I'll take what I can get."

Ms Marvel, Riri Williams, and America Chavez are NOT well-liked characters, and while Marvel and even Sony has turned unloved characters into mainstays, it annoys me how Marvel pitches them like they’re already wildly successful and just HAD to be included into the MCU before prioritizing X-men or other shit people actually want.
Half the people who were interested in Square Enix Avengers lost interest the *MOMENT* that Ms Marvel showed up. Just saying.

And I really don’t think that people just don’t like those characters because they are minorities. After all, EVERYONE loves Miles Morales now and all it took was one good movie. 
And did you notice how everyone cheered when Black Panther showed up in Endgame? Or when Wanda fought Thanos?

I don’t remember a single person cheering when that forced Girl Power moment happened in Endgame when every female hero teleports to the same area to protect wee baby Peter Parker the fragile little boy.

But again, massive cheers when Wanda almost SINGLEHANDEDLY killed Thanos.

You never hear criticisms of Wandas power level, only poorly fleshed out characters like Captain Marvel, who’s powers are also absolutely abysmally written. I have to skip most of her moments in Endgame just to keep my suspension of disbelief.

The vast vast vast majority of ppl just want good movies and they don’t care about race or gender.

All that to say, Marvel is obviouslypjtting politics first here.

2831,2020-12-11 14:33:29,kb1fm5,Not directly by Kevin Feige and Marvel Studios.
2832,2020-12-11 14:43:49,kb1fm5,"Probably still in talks. Its why people can't directly confirm Maguire in SM3, even though its very likely."
2833,2020-12-11 16:03:49,kb1fm5,"My first thought was ""how long ago was this recorded?""

Could be that some things that we've heard were not locked down entirely when they filmed this for the presentation."
2834,2020-12-11 16:49:44,kb1fm5,I honestly I hope not. I'd rather see him play Miguel O'Hara in live action
2835,2020-12-11 12:45:57,kb1fm5,"It's an error of writing, my fault. Thanks for making me notice that ;)"
2836,2020-12-11 16:07:51,kb1fm5,"I imagine the next big movie we hear confirmation on will be just a normal Avengers 5, introducing us to a new team and such. Then I bet it'll be a Young Avengers movie with all these character being introduced. And then in a decade, I bet we get Secret Wars."
2837,2020-12-11 16:43:18,kb1fm5,"It seems to combat this, they're going to start doing mini arcs. Basically, going full on comic books thanks to the introduction of TV shows. They no longer needs 23 films to introduce and flesh out characters, so events can happen a lot more frequently and be tied to their own specific corner of the MCU.

For example, it appears we have several for sure happening within the next 2-3 years. 

1. Multiverse - Wandavision, Spidey 3, and DS2.

2. Thunderbolts - F&TWS, Black Widow, She Hulk

3. Time - Loki, Thor 4, Ant-Man 3

4. Young Avengers - (this will take a while though due to so many shows and characters)

5. Secret Invasion - Ms. Marvel, Secret Invasion, Captain Marvel 2, Armor Wars?

6. Maybe something Midnight Sons related? - This is where I'd slot Blade and Moon Knight"
2838,2020-12-11 16:11:14,kb1fm5,"Imo, I feel like the ground threat will be The Thunderbolts, and the larger “cosmic” threats will be Kang, the Skrulls, and with FF announced, eventually Doom will be the overarching big bad. I’m probably wrong though."
2839,2020-12-11 20:44:27,kb1fm5,Secret  Wars he pretty much hinted at if
2840,2020-12-11 12:44:45,kb1fm5,"Thank you, I didn't notice that. Error of writing ;)"
2841,2020-12-11 12:34:53,kb1fm5,"*Thanks so much for this,*

*I was wondering if I*

*Had missed anything!*

2842,2020-12-11 19:01:55,kb1fm5,"This was the most shocking to me. GotG really cracked open the MCU. I'm not sure I wanna see Rudolph pulling the Benatar, but it's James Gunn so maybe I do. I can't imagine what it will be."
2843,2020-12-12 02:18:39,kb1fm5,What is this???????
2844,2020-12-11 16:28:04,kb1fm5,At least Wanda vision and falcon and the winter solider are coming out in a few months (in a month in Wanda vision’s case)
2845,2020-12-11 13:02:57,kb1fm5,I think she is in college and quit
2846,2020-12-11 13:03:16,kb1fm5,"she’s in the middle of getting her degree, she probably didn’t wanna drop out for a role"
2847,2020-12-11 17:41:13,kb1fm5,"Is it really recasting when they get an older version of someone to play a character? Like they didn’t recast Monica Rambeau, just someone who is older."
2848,2020-12-11 20:01:06,kb1fm5,"that's what I've been thinking! a timeline where N'jadaka grew up aware of his heritage & became right hand to his cousin, maybe; given a chance to jump timelines and help another Wakanda by becoming its Black Panther."
2849,2020-12-11 14:09:20,kb1fm5,"Yes it is from my understanding. 

Phase 5 will announce movies and shows like they did for phase 4 a year and a half ago.

This is just confirmation/updates on what it going on"
2850,2020-12-11 19:20:22,kb1fm5,Did Feige say a while back they wouldn’t be doing clearly defined phases moving forward from Endgame?
2851,2020-12-11 16:26:54,kb1fm5,"It's mostly phase 4. It's just expanded significantly since it was originally announced. If I had to guess, anything beyond 2023 will be Phase 5, but we aren't close yet hence there aren't many details. They just say it's coming with a small detail and moved on. Everything in phase 2 pretty much is already getting ready to film within the next year it seems."
2852,2020-12-11 13:06:53,kb1fm5,He said that after saying Secret Invasion was the most popular comic event of the last decades with Civil War.
2853,2020-12-11 15:10:44,kb1fm5,"Yup, he said that."
2854,2020-12-11 15:02:07,kb1fm5,He did say that
2855,2020-12-11 19:06:38,kb1fm5,More like 3 years since it's December. Hopefully we have mutants in early 2024. We've waited 12yrs we're in the endgame now.
2856,2020-12-11 15:04:14,kb1fm5,"Has it finished pre-production yet? If not, that's probably why there's no release date."
2857,2020-12-11 15:17:31,kb1fm5,">It almost seems like there are no more slots

What do you mean by no more slots?"
2858,2020-12-12 01:28:31,kb1fm5,"Thor 4 moved to May 2022 so the February 2022 spot is now vacant. I assume that's where Ant-Man 3 will go. If it was a Disney+ original film, they would have made a big deal about it at the Investor Day."
2859,2020-12-12 13:12:29,kb1fm5,"I think its going to be

Mcu movies with my prediction release date:

2021
May: Black Widow
July: Shang-chi
November: Eternals
December: Spiderman 3 (Sony Property)

2022
February: Deadpool 3 (Maybe still a Fox or Adult Disney Property)
March: Doctor Strange 2
May: Thor: 4
July: Black Panther 2
November: Captain Marvel 2

2023
February: Antman 3
May: GotG 3
July: F4 or Blade (my money on F4)
November: F4 or Blade (my money on blade cause halloween)

End of Phase 4

Beginning of Phase 5

2024: New Avengers and Mutants/Xmen

PS:
- Maybe just like they did to sony properties(spiderman, maybe venom and morbius), they dont give any subtle hints to deadpool 3, maybe feigi is still waiting for the announcement of Disney plus adult version and maybe adult marvel has a different line up that would not break the mcu slots. Maybe they have a different slot/releases in the mcu. They could also tie the adult mcu movies in the disney plus adult version just like the fox's r rated stuffs.

- Or they still wont include Deadpool 3 as an mcu property until they finish its trilogy with the fox characters and maybe deadpool would be the only one that would transcend to the MCU."
2860,2020-12-11 14:14:18,kb1fm5,They will most definitely feature in these films though. They want to take it slow so the fans can forgot about the old x-men films.
2861,2020-12-11 16:30:36,kb1fm5,"Considering the last X-Men movie came out last year, I'm sure they want a cool down period before bringing them back. Right now 2024 is when I'd expect to see any movement on a show or movie for them. Phase 5 doesn't really have much announced yet outside of Blade, Fantastic 4, and Deadpool which just hired writers, but that's pretty much it. F4 got announced I think because it'll be in 2023 and it's the easiest to reboot of the Fox stuff."
2862,2020-12-11 18:51:29,kb1fm5,"Hopefully they make X-men a phase 5 series instead of trying to cram their stories into 3 or 4 movies. Then they can have movies for certain characters or crossovers, and several seasons for just X-men stories. Just imagine them actually being able to do the Dark Phoenix Saga correctly over a period of time instead of making such a long story fit into 2 or 3 hours."
2863,2020-12-11 15:11:26,kb1fm5,"I'm hoping it's soon, they could definitely hint at it in the Wandavision show and Doctor Strange movie."
2864,2020-12-11 16:49:07,kb1fm5,I wouldn't be surprised if months down the line they announce a hybrid release like Raya. That's if there's no major progress in the US (which is possible given what's going on).
2865,2020-12-11 17:23:45,kb1fm5,"Announcing any changes yesterday would have been premature, really. I think the Q1 earnings call (early Feb?) would've been the time to get any hint of a final decision. By then the *Soul*, *WW84* and early vaccination numbers would be in. 

If they stick to May 2021 they don't need to decide on release method until mid-March."
2866,2020-12-12 01:31:15,kb1fm5,"Ikr, it's such a great time to be a Marvel fan rn (when hasn't it been lately?). Funny enough though, a ton of people on this sub don't seem to like Spider-Verse happening because it's nothing more than ""fan-service"" lol."
2867,2020-12-11 16:09:03,kb1fm5,"It's not entirely out of the question yet, Disney didn't need to make that move 5.5 months out from the release date.

If things are still bad around March, I'd imagine Disney will reconsider it then, and make the call around that time."
2868,2020-12-12 05:06:30,kb1fm5,"Ronny Chieng is playing ""Jon Jon"", unfamiliar with the character. Tony Leung is 100% playing the Mandarin, who seems to be named Wenwu in the film."
2869,2020-12-14 10:38:32,kb1fm5,Im assuming theyll be sporadically introduced throughout phase 4 using deapdool to anchor a lot of that. Would be the best way and easiest for the fans to engage with
2870,2020-12-11 19:24:04,kb1fm5,And the GotG holiday special is holiday season 2022

2872,2020-12-12 14:47:45,kb1fm5,"Might be, or this presentation was recorded before the announcement came out."
2873,2020-12-11 21:32:40,kb1fm5,School commitments
2874,2020-12-14 10:39:46,kb1fm5,Im disregarding this because they literally announced Charlie Cox as Daredevil in Spiderman 3 lol
2875,2020-12-11 23:10:53,kb1fm5,Cuz Ant Man is the one who came up with the idea to time travel
2876,2020-12-11 13:38:47,kb1fm5,May I ask why?
2877,2020-12-11 14:39:31,kb1fm5,She Hulk has been a comedic character/series for over 30 years.
2878,2020-12-11 14:45:27,kb1fm5,Literally what her character is about
2879,2020-12-12 00:47:52,kb1fm5,"Remember that Loki and Miles Morales were not very good characters in the comics either. Then came movies with really good reimaginings and executions and kerplow, they’re major fan favourites and hugely marketable. 

Riri and Chavez are good concepts and will be done better. As for Kamala - she’s one of the most popular characters in pretty much everything she’s ever been in, she was huge in the comics, a favourite at school book fairs, the standout character of the Enix game and hotly anticipated for an MCU debut."
2880,2020-12-11 14:34:33,kb1fm5,"Of course Jeremy Renner is in Hawkeye. I didn't list him because it's pretty obvious, like it is for Wanda, Vision, Falcon and Bucky."
2881,2020-12-11 18:08:07,kb1fm5,I feel like this is a joke....but I'm not quite sure
2882,2020-12-11 18:51:49,kb1fm5,Man you don't know how real this is.
2883,2020-12-11 20:15:56,kb1fm5,That's kinda sad man
2884,2020-12-11 17:35:09,kb1fm5,"To be fair, 4 of those projects were meant for this year and there's a chance that some of these future projects could get delayed since the pandemic will probably still be around for the majority of 2021."
2885,2020-12-11 17:27:07,kb1fm5,"Rumors has that the mutants will start appearing here and there planting the seeds for their official introduction. Apparently some mutants might appear in FATWS and Shang-Chi. A long time ago I also read in this sub that the X-Men wouldn't appear in the MCU until Phase 5 and it seems like its true. 

But I think it makes sense tho, they're introducing so many major characters in this Phase. Young Avengers, Shang-Chi, She-Hulk, Eternals, Moon Knight, etc. It's better to spread things out or people might get overwhelmed and confused with all the new characters."
2886,2020-12-11 19:21:55,kb1fm5,"But we knew it was coming eventually though. At least the logo looks nice, but to me this announcement only means we’re getting F4 sooner then we thought (perhaps 2024👀)"
2887,2020-12-11 23:58:08,kb1fm5,"Yeah, I think thats been the number 1 casting for those 2 for a while now so hopefully it happens."
2888,2020-12-12 04:10:16,kb1fm5,I want them too but part of me is theorising that Marvel casts a younger Fantastic Four so they can keep them around longer.
2889,2020-12-12 07:07:42,kb1fm5,"They've been my fancast for years now, dont have anyone for Johnny and Ben though. Ideally Johnny will be younger so they can capitalise on his friendship with Peter."
2890,2020-12-14 10:24:52,kb1fm5,"I heard from somebody close with Feige and who works for disney on the star wars series too that they have already been casted as most have a year prior to announcement. Im being dead serious

Save this comment for when it happens"
2891,2020-12-11 16:57:56,kb1fm5,You are not alone.
2892,2020-12-11 17:44:02,kb1fm5,"I feel this so hard. I was telling my dad about all the shows and movies they announced and he told me stop by the time they had only gotten to like the Little Mermaid one. He said he was ""overwhelmed"". I then texted my friends about all the Marvel stuff because I needed to talk about it with people"
2893,2020-12-11 19:11:41,kb1fm5,Fandomwire just directly confirmed Maguire and they’re the ones who broke the Spider-Verse scoop in the first place
2894,2020-12-11 12:49:37,kb1fm5,We are a community and you did a huge work for us! Thank you! Glad to have helped a bit!
2895,2020-12-11 18:59:27,kb1fm5,"So in like 7-9 years after we’ve seen “mini Avengers movies”, crossovers in the vein of Civil War, we might see a true Avengers crossover: with the Young Avengers, Midnight Sons, Guardians of The Galaxy, Eternals standing shoulder to shoulder with the Thunderbolts/Dark Avengers. Fuuuuuck"
2896,2020-12-11 22:26:00,kb1fm5,"I wouldn't mind if this phase was ""you messed with time now time messes BACK"" while the next phase gives us a full boardroom with Dr. Doom, Magneto, Norman Osborne, Lady Loki and that asshole Namor"
2897,2020-12-11 12:48:14,kb1fm5,Oh my god finally! Good bot
2898,2020-12-11 22:27:41,kb1fm5,Between this and then being in Thor 4 I think they re giving us as much time as they can with these guys....and then part 3 is the last and final time they're all together
2899,2020-12-11 18:59:24,kb1fm5,FatWS will come out right after WV if they're dropping one episode a week. Then Black Widow and Loki right after in May.
2900,2020-12-11 14:57:26,kb1fm5,Ah ok cheers
2901,2020-12-11 17:43:26,kb1fm5,Ah well. It'll forever be weird that she's Cassie in just the one scene but this new girl looks more like an older version of the little girl to me.
2902,2020-12-11 16:46:22,kb1fm5,Kinda weird to do imo
2903,2020-12-11 16:47:44,kb1fm5,"Big props to her, getting an education is rad and cool"
2904,2020-12-11 21:21:52,kb1fm5,"I dunno, she's been such a big fan of the role and has been reading comics and vying for YA. She probably had some contract to not say anything, but her social media shows she took out Cassie from her bio as the announcement hit, seems a little.... odd"
2905,2020-12-11 16:48:39,kb1fm5,"Wtf? What is she studying? I hope she's not putting her acting career on the backburner to get a degree in the arts, when she has already broken into the industry.

Also nearly all schools are offering online class now due to covid."
2906,2020-12-11 18:39:06,kb1fm5,"Well, we already saw an older version of Cassie in Emma Fuhrmann, so yeah, this counts as a recast. Super stoked though, I’m a huge Kathryn Newton fan and it’s about time she got her big break."
2907,2020-12-11 23:18:17,kb1fm5,It technically wouldn’t be recasting so to me it makes the most sense.
2908,2020-12-11 19:21:45,kb1fm5,"Oh bummer, I always thought that having clearly defined phases helped having a cohesive narrative."
2909,2020-12-11 15:07:14,kb1fm5,"Its set to begin filming spring 2021, confirmed by multiple actors. 

Thats before Black Panther 2 or Captain Marvel 2, yet it received no release date like they did. They even spaced out the 2022 films (Thor 4 not February now, but May, Black Panther July from May, Captain Marvel November from July) yet nothing about Ant-Man. Its weird."
2910,2020-12-11 15:20:26,kb1fm5,"In 2022, they shifted Thor 4 from Feb to May, kept DS2 to March, shifted Black Panther 2 from May to July, shifted CM2 from July to November. 

Its filming too late for Feb 2022 (they film spring 2021), so there aren't any other available 2022 slots, yet its filming before BP2 and CM2. Just pointing out how weird that is. Even Guardians got a confirmed 2023 release year."
2911,2020-12-11 14:33:33,kb1fm5,"Agreed. I most definitely think there will be Easter eggs with the mutants involved particularly once the multiverse has been expanded upon in the next few movies and tv shows. FF4 is big but the X-men are huge. I’m assuming they’re still casting as well. My god could you imagine a marvel team up similar to endgame with all the avengers, FF4, and the X-men against *insert ultimate bad guy*?"
2912,2020-12-11 14:28:43,kb1fm5,True. Didn't we hear that one of the shows will visit Madripoor?
2913,2020-12-11 18:54:46,kb1fm5,"I bet they start showing up in post credit scenes toward the end of phase 4. Even before they have casting done they could show claws popping out of a hand, or the back of a bald head sitting in a wheelchair."
2914,2020-12-14 10:31:15,kb1fm5,I think they are going to use Deadpool to ease mutants into the MCU. Hence why Feige also has announced and talked about moving forward with DP3
2915,2020-12-11 22:00:43,kb1fm5,"Yeah nobody said they can not. But they clearly didnt make that decision and stupid Daniel said they made that decision already hours after WW announcement on HBOMax

This was straight his assumptions out of his ass and made up bullshit  😂

Bruh they decided this recently and not when Daniel siad this. He told that right of his aas. They never considered this movie a Disney + release back then lol"
2916,2020-12-11 13:42:03,kb1fm5,"I have a feeling that the character will be retconned into a more TV-friendly version of the character such as being an All-American Sweetheart trope just by looking at Gomez's acting history. Also, it's obvious that the character is Afro-Latina, while they casted a white passing Latina for the role. As a black woman this means a lot to me."
2917,2020-12-12 08:01:45,kb1fm5,"What's funny wars that going into the avengers game I sort of rolled my eyes about ms marvels inclusion, and knew nothing about her as a character.

Even though I felt the game was mostly a letdown, Kamala was easily the best part of the game and was written and acted very well- I hope the ms marvel show is as good as her character in the game lol. That has made me a bit more open minded about characters I'm not familiar with."
2918,2020-12-12 04:35:22,kb1fm5,"I haven’t met or talked to a single person who was interested in Ms Marvel, nor have I even heard her character mentioned in passing by anyone but a marketing arm of a Marvel entity"
2919,2020-12-11 19:37:47,kb1fm5,I’m sorry - I hope things look up for you soon!!
2920,2020-12-11 22:22:25,kb1fm5,Meh. I'lll take what I can get some days lol.
2921,2020-12-11 20:31:36,kb1fm5,[deleted]
2922,2020-12-11 17:44:35,kb1fm5,"i fear u might be right. it would be a real bummer if the movie slate got bumped again. if things aren’t looking good in may and the new raya movie is a success with its simultaneous release in theaters and d+ premier access, i think its possible the mcu films adopt that model until we get back to normal"
2923,2020-12-11 19:59:21,kb1fm5,[deleted]
2924,2020-12-14 00:52:08,kb1fm5,My exact thoughts when Jon Watts was announced as director
2925,2020-12-11 17:42:41,kb1fm5,"I promised myself I’d get all my holiday shopping done last night and instead I turned my living room into the Pepe Silvia investigation trying to figure out who is a Skrull in our MCU. 

I’m on to you Principal Morita!"
2926,2020-12-11 17:50:13,kb1fm5,My dad and I watch all the Marvel and Star Wars stuff as it comes out and he genuinely enjoys it but texting him is like texting a brick wall. Told him all about the new stuff coming and his reply was “cool beans.” Good talk dad!
2927,2020-12-11 13:00:56,kb1fm5,Thanks!
2928,2020-12-11 19:14:23,kb1fm5,"Yep, this is without knowing when or what they'll do with the X-men, though I think Fiege will want to do shows for them and then build to a movie.

2931,2020-12-11 23:09:34,kb1fm5,"I think it’s because of how exponentially things have expanded. Having such a tight structure like the earlier phases would be limiting imo. I think of it like multiple phases happening at once, it’s much more fluid now and opens more opportunities. Now we can have a “multiverse phase” and a “thunderbolts phase” and a “secret invasion phase” happening simultaneously instead of benching irrelevant characters or shoehorning them places they don’t belong for the sake of focusing on one singular narrative at a time. You can still have structure and organize them by arcs for an optimal viewing experience, but the numbered system is less relevant now with how the mcu has expanded and evolved"

2939,2020-12-11 18:06:56,kb1fm5,"This is incredibly offensive. As someone who is much more “white passing” than Xochitl Gomez, I can’t help but be angered by your Latinx erasure. First of all, I do not see anything “white passing” about Xochitl Gomez. From her incredibly ethnic name to her clearly Latinx appearance. Second, America Chavez is not “obviously” Afro-Latinx. You are basing this solely on her appearance in the comics as she isn’t ever stated to be from a Afro-Latinx background. I’m am happy that you identify with her. I think that is great, but don’t try to monopolize the character. We should be celebrating that they are bringing America Chavez into the MCU and that they are giving a woman of color an opportunity to represent her on film."
2940,2020-12-11 14:22:40,kb1fm5,"Yeah I understand where you are coming from. Honestly I don’t know a lot about America Chavez or Xochitl Gomez, but I just hope she does the role proud.
 
Im sure that Marvel Studios will portray the character in a way that people can be proud of, and look up to with respect to the comics. In Feige and Raimi we trust!"
2941,2020-12-11 23:15:21,kb1fm5,"She really does not look white passing to me. Yeah her skin is like light tan but her features don’t look white/European. This trend of calling literally everybody that has light skin white passing is kinda getting annoying. Just because white girls are trying to look more racially ambiguous doesn’t mean that women who already look like that look white now. 

But yeah aside from that if America Chavez is supposed to be Afro Latina then they messed up big time. Hopefully they won’t retcon the character like you said."

3053,2020-12-11 14:23:20,kavu8a,"That's.... A lot. I can't say I'm thrilled about at least half of the projects announced and it *really* seems like they're scraping the bottom of the barrel for which Star Wars/Marvel characters they can spin-off, but at the very least it means I'll probably have to actually get a Disney+ subscription. On top of bringing out enough new originals that there's gotta be a Star Wars and Marvel episode of something every week for the whole year, their plans to bring more mature stuff to Disney+ means there might actually be a good back-catalogue of FX shows to catch up on. 

Overall the MCU stuff is standing out to me in just how consistently they're plucking directors and writers from seemingly nowhere. Star Wars keep announcing names I'm excited to hear are helming their shows/TV- Taika Waititi, Tony Gilroy, Patty Jenkins Leslye Headland, Justin Simien and Deborah Chow are all known quantities at this point and really exciting picks. Unless I'm missing something on the MCU front, there's not a single big name here, almost every announced writer/director has no more than a few episodes of a minor sitcom under their belts. Have established names like Taika Waititi, Ryan Coogler and James Gunn not given us possibly the best stuff in the MCU? Has The Mandalorian not shown that those big names can slot well into a TV format? It's obviously too early to say but as someone who's usually more excited by who's behind the camera than who's in front, it's giving me the impression that Marvel are seeking out writers/directors who will just do what they're told with no real style or flair. Picking someone like Jon Watts based on their experience with low-budget indie films that actually have some personality is a lot different than seemingly throwing darts at a list of random sitcom writers/directors."
3054,2020-12-11 14:28:43,kavu8a,Will the Muppet Christmas Carol 4K remaster be up before Christmas? Just want to know if I should delay watching it this year until the remaster comes out.

3057,2020-12-11 15:28:36,kavu8a,Disney truly is wringing out every single drop out of the wet paper towel that is Star Wars
3058,2020-12-11 16:53:24,kavu8a,This is missing even more stuff like *Lightyear* and *Encanto*. Disney really did just announce everything for the next like 4 years.
3059,2020-12-11 16:54:49,kavu8a,Since Disney owns Hulu why didn't they announce anything going there?

Chang Latoya Muhammed Yakamoto is an outcast at school, but then she discovers that she can achieve everything she wants to in life!!!  And she meets friends along the way who teach her what's important in life!!

Here's another one:

Tayshaun Cheong Ahmed Singh feels like an outcast in his school.  But then he meets friends who inspire him to overcome all obstacles!!!  And they learn valuable lessons along the way!!!

Every idea Disney has here is garbage.  Nothing but SJW cringe in absolute every single one of these.  All trash.  Never have I been more thankful to have grown up in the era I did than now.  Holy fuckin shit, the sad part is that Disney will profit off all this SJW drivel.  Today's parents are so weak, they don't know how to raise kids right.

You may want to get some variety on your media diet then, champ.

That's how you fight over sweetness, cleanse your palate and stop being a little bitch, as if the mouse is holding a gun to your head to watch all of this. They're not all for you, dummy. 

Don't like the sugar? Seek some savory in ""foreign"" film (as I'm sure you've American), build up the patience to ""read"" subtitles and expand your horizons of media consumption. 

You're getting mad at popcorn movies being sold as popcorn movies."
3128,2020-12-11 06:16:42,kavu8a,It's pretty crazy a guy can make wild shit for A24 and solid stuff for Disney as well. Takes a helluva balancing act to pull both off rather successfully.
3129,2020-12-11 08:01:34,kavu8a,Well I think something that should be stated is that Disney has given their plan for roughly the next four years. Every streaming service can make plans to compete since many don’t really unveil their plans that far out.
3130,2020-12-11 14:14:07,kavu8a,We don't that the sequel will be about a marriage fallout though do we ?

3133,2020-12-11 08:51:35,kavu8a,They’ve been doing this since the 90’s - every movie back then had at least 3 sequels and an animated show. It’s just Disney+ is the new direct-to-video.
3134,2020-12-11 08:34:58,kavu8a,"thats what it feels like, but heres why youre wrong. this was an investor call, disney is basically telling investors what they plan on doing in the near future. as a result, this looks like a lot of shit, but remember, its not all coming out at once, so it wont feel like oversaturation since nobody is gonna be watching 10 star wars shows back to back"
3135,2020-12-11 06:44:36,kavu8a,"Thats what happens when you invest in a subscription service. You need compelling exclusives in order to suck in those sweet sweet monthly payments so Disney is scraping the bottom of the barrel for literally any IP they can milk.

Who knows what the quality is going to be like if they're going to rush all this to market."
3136,2020-12-11 10:28:03,kavu8a,"They are. The next 3 or 4 years is the climax of the streaming wars and this is Disney's main offensive. 


Once they have conclusively won or .ore realistically settled into a stalemate with Netflix and HBO Max,  they will likely settle down and release content more strategically paced. 


I think I'm starting to despise the word ""content"". It feels almost dystopic.



Oh well. I suppose ""looking on the bright side"" people will be getting their moneys worth with Disney+ for the next few years."
3137,2020-12-11 16:50:53,kavu8a,"That’s the whole goal of Disney though. Create an IP and build around it with movies, TV shows, theme park rides, and most importantly—toys. They need to make these shows around their IP to keep the name out there and to get people to buy the toys."
3138,2020-12-11 16:11:51,kavu8a,You should watch Cobra Kai (Karate Kid universe show) on Netflix. That's madness.

3142,2020-12-11 18:18:53,kavu8a,"I think the main problem for me is that Marvel does want you to watch everything. All the shows are tying into the movies, so instead of watching maybe 10 hours of movies like normal, you have to watch an additional 10 hours of disney+ to understand it. I’m not going to do that, so I probably won’t watch the movies either"
3143,2020-12-11 06:15:30,kavu8a,"As long as it uses *Star Wars* as a setting and not an excuse to cram in a lot of Jedi stuff, I'm cool with this. The known galaxy in *Star Wars* is vast and stuff that's only been teased in the countless films and shows opens up avenues for storytellers to explore. Hell, I'd be game for a whole series that's basically *The Wire* meets *Blade Runner* on the lowest levels on Corusant."
3144,2020-12-11 05:02:28,kavu8a,"If it's Mandalorian-quality, it won't feel like oversaturation at all."
3145,2020-12-11 05:02:17,kavu8a,Yeah I mean this is enough content for 10 lifetimes worth. My theory is that since they’ve axed theatrical releases they gone all in on streaming services.
3146,2020-12-11 06:47:18,kavu8a,Yeah clearly they did that with Marvel and now nobody wants to watch anything Marvel anymore. Oh wait.
3147,2020-12-11 05:59:24,kavu8a,Because 450+ books didn’t do that?
3148,2020-12-11 05:52:11,kavu8a,"Are we seriously already complaining about the new Star Wars content?

How much bitching is reddit capable of?"
3149,2020-12-11 06:12:44,kavu8a,Honestly rather this than a bunch of movies. Plus different parts of the timeline with different takes. Some are limited series. The Visions thing might be the most intriguing thing for me as I love stuff like Animatrix and Batman: Gotham Knight
3150,2020-12-11 05:09:27,kavu8a,"I was hoping they would make Mandalorian seasons longer. 8 episodes isn't enough. If these other shows are just as good, I'm happy!"
3151,2020-12-11 19:41:12,kavu8a,Compared to what?  Star Trek had a new episode every week for decades.  Marvel comic books have been coming out over and over for decades more.  Pop culture *is* more content.
3152,2020-12-12 03:22:20,kavu8a,I say go for it. The Star Wars universe is literally a gigantic space universe with trillions of stories to tell. It’s perfect for serial television shows.

Avengers: Endgame was the highest grossing movie of all time and we've had a more than a year since anything Marvel being released. It's wrong to say that the vast majority are experiencing Marvel fatigue. Star Wars is a bit different because of how poorly the sequel trilogy was handled but people seem to enjoy The Mandalorian."

3165,2020-12-11 17:31:14,kavu8a,"Different streaming services are focused on different genres. Disney knows their life blood is MCU/Star Wars, and animated shows/movies based on all the IP they have purchased.

That's in stark difference to Netflix that is dabbling in everything and anything trying to find something that sticks. Hell, they have Netflix sponsored Bollywood movies now, complete with song and dance."
3166,2020-12-11 16:03:59,kavu8a,Seems like a bunch are anthology style mini series. As long as they have a clear arc through like 10-12 episodes you can some really awesome stories that way.
3167,2020-12-11 18:27:07,kavu8a,"Personally I don’t like that the movies and shows are linked, because I don’t want to double how much marvel stuff I watch. So I probably won’t watch any marvel movies or shows at all, but thats just me and we’ll see if most audiences will continue to follow both"

But I get what you're saying and it reminds me of that movie Fanboys, which, for better or worse as a movie, has that story of just desperately wanting to live long enough to see that next thing, that big event or conclusion or whatever that the next generation will just never experience. I know Marvel/EU and everything have been going on for decades and that stories don't simply ""end"" in comics and novels and whatever, but it just makes me think that I'll never get an ending to die with that someone who saw Jedi in 1983 might have been able to. Morbid, but I take your point."

In the main timeline, Loki is still dead. Killed in IW.

The show takes place in the timeline where Tony and crew went back to New York 2012 get the Tesseract. It was knocked out of the suitcase and Loki picked it up and teleported away. The series will be following that Loki."

3214,2020-12-11 11:46:30,kavu8a,"Some people are upset because it looks like creative bankruptcy, i am not quite sure how you can say they'll explore the universe with these shows either tbh, it's really all things linked to already established names and ideas. That's not exploration, that's minimal risk and handing out a ton of fan service.  
The idea of quality is almost meaningless in such a construct, yeah ofc it will be up to a certain standard with disney's budget, but that's about it. Star Wars started as a milestone which pushed boundaries, i am not the biggest fan of the franchise, but even i have to at least give it props there, now it is no more than a brand name used to print as many dollars as possible."
3215,2020-12-11 11:35:23,kavu8a,">star wars has a established a massive universe, ofc things happen in it??

So far in Disney's Star Wars universe they've taken place in a short 20 years period (basically the middle of the Empire through just after) or it's the Sequels, which take place 30 years later but looks exactly like the OT era. Look at most of these shows. It's again mostly more Empire vs Rebels era stuff. They need to branch out and stop with just Empire stuff"
3216,2020-12-11 07:33:39,kavu8a,"Its like a carbon copy of them announting 15 or so star wars movies just as TFA was a smash hit, right after they got one successful TV series."

There are probably a lot of great ideas just waiting to happen that could use backing, but Disney are playing it super safe instead."

And they're really scraping the bottom of the barrel for content looking at what stories they are trying to tell. This shit is like spinoffs of spinoffs, who actually wants this nonsense even if it is good?"

3224,2020-12-12 01:12:01,kavu8a,"That’s exactly what they’re doing, and I think it’s smart. I initially subscribed for three reasons:

1: Mandalorian

2: National Geographic

3: To share my account with my dad and step mom because I know they’d love it, but would never get their own account

The problems I have though is that Mandalorian is the only show that I really enjoy on there and their selection for NatGeo friggin sucks. I mean they have literally decades of material that they could put up, but there’s almost nothing on the NatGeo side. 

With The Mandalorian wrapping up I’ve been thinking about just canceling my subscription and just reactivating when something good comes along, but then I remember reason number three. I love getting texts from my dad saying “We just watched ~insert movie here~ last night. It really made me think about all the times I watched it with you and your brothers. Thanks again for sharing with us, son” and that’s why it’s worth whatever I pay each year."

That’s 12 movies worth of content, which is releasing over 3 years, even though thats the amount released over the past 5 years. And that doesn’t even include most movies"

3237,2020-12-11 23:05:47,kavu8a,"most of their movies can be seen in a vacuum except the obvious sequels. Like you could watch Dr Strange without watching any of the previous films. You can watch Ant-man without knowledge of any of the previous films. But you can't watch Captain America 3 without watching, at minimum, the previous captain america movies. Marvel has been pretty good about this. They're following the comic logic- people will follow their favorite character's arc, but don't necessarily have time to see every comic available. So as long as the person follows their favorite character, they're gonna be fine."
3238,2020-12-11 08:31:33,kavu8a,"yea just based off of the blurbs about what we know is in the works, theres a huge diversity of star wars content that theyre pursuing. theyve got sequel era shows like the mandalorian, theyve got prequel era shows like kenobi, theyve got movies set in the high republic era, a period of time nobody has seen yet, theyve got a war movie coming up with patty jenkins, etc"

3246,2020-12-11 12:00:25,kavu8a,"While i do not necessarily subscribe to the idea that this will definitely lead to an oversaturation for star wars, it's also not as simple as saying ""hey it didn't happen with marvel therefore it won't happen with star wars"".   
Each IP is different, with strengths and weaknesses (also marvel's big success so far was mostly cinema driven in the space of live action mediums) which apply differently to the zeitgeist, etc.  
This is a lot of stuff, the mandalorian being a hit is great, but will it translate into people wanting to see a show about some guy from rogue one? Do people really wanna see a lando series? Idk, we'll have to see."

3250,2020-12-11 06:16:10,kavu8a,"There's only like 50 Canon novels, and as someone who's read them all + all the comics, they're overwhelmingly great, but they're only consumed by a fraction of the audience. That's not enough to ""oversaturate"" Star Wars, which I don't think is possible given how rich and diverse the universe's lore is."
3251,2020-12-24 20:31:17,kavu8a,They weren't main series canon in the same way that a sequel to the movies is.

This basically keeps the theaters happy with Disney (they get something to show) and keeps the ""GIVE ME EVERYTHING IMMEDIATELY"" folks happy too. There's a choice rather than a forced one. Also they said it was gonna be one-offs for the most part- not every movie will have the option to do so, but they reserve the right to do it when they feel like it."

They used their setting of a warfront to tell stories about what battle really does to a man, and how the veneer of civilization starts to deteriorate when faced with an existential threat. That's a story TNG could *never* tell because of the show's premise - a mission of exploration and discovery.

But reading the descriptions of these shows, especially The Acolyte and Visions, I think they're at least trying to make it LOOK like they're putting the effort in. They're introducing a new, completely unexplored era, they're trying out new styles and creative leads... And some of this other stuff, the Kenobi show, The Bad Batch, a live-action Ahsoka show, people have been begging them for this stuff for ages, we all expected these announcements. Plus it looks like Dave Filoni is really stepping up, who was the voice of reason in the Star Wars universe and history even back under Lucas.

Like yeah, obviously this is all profit-motivated, and if they can just pull all of this out of their ass in a year then the more moral move would have been to chuck that same money at 500 young, brilliant sci-fi writers desperate to make their mark with their own original series. But was anybody expecting that?

Also, I'm learning that I really, really like big collaborative worldbuilding projects. Maybe it's a kid's way of thinking, but I like lightsabers and The Force and Jedi, and I want to see lots of stories from that world. I like the lore, I like seeing new takes on the stuff I grew up with. It's like a big DnD game where all the players are actors and Filoni is the DM."
3292,2020-12-11 18:01:44,kavu8a,"The Acolyte is sitting right there. Mark my words, if it becomes the biggest of the shows they’ll double down on fresh Star Wars settings. On the other hand, if its Andor... More Rebels vs Empire."
3293,2020-12-12 03:23:57,kavu8a,You've seen the shows they just announced already?
3294,2020-12-12 00:43:08,kavu8a,"Mandalorian, Clone wars, and Rebels have all been superb in a last few years. They are going to be putting out A+ content; if it is at all like the Mandalorian season 2."
3295,2020-12-11 16:28:24,kavu8a,"Star Wars has the EU as well,its just the amount of the content that feels overwhelming. Esp. with just 1 show released so far."
3296,2020-12-11 11:48:01,kavu8a,"It's funny you say this, because in reality most edgelords are big star wars and marvel fans :)"

3298,2020-12-11 10:10:47,kavu8a,"Ugh, I hate when a service I pay for makes content that I like!"
3299,2020-12-12 00:47:00,kavu8a,"That usually means they’re doing it right

This sub fawns over Warner Brothers and HBO Max and that shit is a total flop lmao"
3300,2020-12-12 07:20:10,kavu8a,"Well remember this was actually an investor showcase. Although all the news was made public to us, the real point of this was to say to their financiers, ""look how much we have planned. We're still a worthy investment. It's a good idea to give us more money."""
3301,2020-12-11 15:00:42,kavu8a,"Oh Ok.

This doesn't have much to do with anything but most marriages don't really end in divorce. Traditionally you'll hear something like 40-50 but that stat is skewed a *lot* by serial divorcers/repeat offenders. Probably a good lower than a third of first marriages end in divorce. Of course, that's not to say these marriages are all still happy. 

Well now that i'm off that tangent, thanks for the info and glad you got through yours."

3303,2020-12-11 08:07:59,kavu8a,The word mediocre can be used to describe nearly every live action Disney movie. So my guess... yeah.
3304,2020-12-12 15:43:18,kavu8a,Mmm. The Warner Brothers deal may change that though. Its an extremely aggressive move. Possibly enough to boost them up there with Netflix and D+.
3305,2020-12-12 13:10:24,kavu8a,Well they weren't.
3306,2020-12-11 16:05:20,kavu8a,I'm really not feeling this second season. It feels like Iron Man 2 to me how they just keep introducing more shit to build the world and service the fans. I liked the smaller scale of the first season more.
3307,2020-12-11 05:42:34,kavu8a,And whatever Taika is doing
3308,2020-12-11 14:10:47,kavu8a,I think the OP was specifically just referring to Star Wars theatrical releases.
3309,2020-12-11 14:07:12,kavu8a,">there’s only 50 canon novels

Sure, but there were over 30 years of books before then. That’s their point."
3310,2020-12-11 13:36:57,kavu8a,This is the way.
3311,2020-12-12 03:31:57,kavu8a,They did back off from movies for a while. They had planned to release a Star Wars movie every year indefinitely.
3312,2020-12-11 15:28:53,kavu8a,"> It’s Star Wars **and Disney**, Reddit is going to bitch about it one way or the other

There, I fixed that for you."
3313,2020-12-11 19:43:11,kavu8a,"I mean, that’s how Star Trek was for decades before I was born and for decades after.  It’s kinda par for the course."
3314,2020-12-11 16:09:19,kavu8a,"I was thinking that at first, but then I realized the Mandalorian is only like 4 hours per season, so casual fans could probably get caught up in one or two weekends a year if they feel the need to watch everything. I grew up watching the same 6 VHS tapes over and over so I'm certainly not complaining."
3315,2020-12-11 14:58:08,kavu8a,We got that with *Last Jedi* but the internet had a stroke and vowed to execute Mickey Mouse if Disney didn't toe the line from now on.
3316,2020-12-11 16:38:35,kavu8a,I don't give a shit personally ... BUT Disney has a terrible track record with Star Wars lately. Can’t be surprised if people are hesitant to be excited. Also... you can only take in so much of this until it becomes over saturated and boring. I think I’ve hit that point with the Marvel content.
3317,2020-12-11 05:26:39,kavu8a,You mean billion? Cuz that’s a reasonable content budget for a streaming platform
3318,2020-12-11 05:26:57,kavu8a,2.4 billion*.
3319,2020-12-11 12:41:48,kavu8a,"Our planet is literally dying around us (and it's all our fault) so I can see why it's hard for people to look to the future with any real optimism. That doesn't mean that I don't want more original work too, I do, but I also feel that a declining civilization is the least of our problems."
3320,2020-12-11 21:42:22,kavu8a,"Characters have always been written and actors have always been chosen to appeal to different audience groups. You are only just starting to notice because for the first time in your life, mainstream American franchises are trying to appeal to groups you don't belong to. But that's okay, because nothing about disabled people, muslim people, women, black people, asians, etc. should be off-putting to you, even if you aren't specifically interested by those traits.

Like, not caring whether a character is black is one thing. Not wanting to watch a show or movie *because* a character is black? There's a word for that."

That is why the empire (and the show) doesn't take place in the core worlds, they are fighting to survive in the outer planets, and they hope to rise up to power. It is implied in the latest episode that they will eventually turn into the New Order. 

But it is telling that the entire remaining empire's main struggles are with one man and his friends, the Mandolorian."
3327,2020-12-11 18:21:33,kavu8a,Slaymo!
3328,2020-12-12 00:31:10,kavu8a,Yeah I figured that's how people would choose to read it. You do you boo.
3329,2020-12-11 21:33:37,kavu8a,"Sure that is totally fair, but i think it is reasonably fair to be a little pessimistic looking at it. You're right with your comment though, no doubt."
3330,2020-12-11 12:23:49,kavu8a,"I agree, there is no difference there, i'd also say all of that is creativeley bankrupt in a way (i am not familiar with everything out there regarding SW though, i am sure some of the things were truly trying to explore new ideas and concepts)  
The concept of milking an IP didn't start with disney+ obviously, but it is still disappointing to see where the priorities lie and maybe even more importantly, how it seems to work as well as it does."
3331,2020-12-11 13:24:19,kavu8a,">So far in Disney's Star Wars universe they've taken place in a short 20 years period (basically the middle of the Empire **through just after**).

Most of these series are literally in the era after the Prequels to a little after the Empire. They will be drenched in OT iconography. Mandalorian is supposed to be 5 years after the Empire. There has been more Empire iconography than anything else in the show. And the sequel era literally just OT iconography. Most of these shows will continue with the same exact iconography of a this tiny period in the Star Wars universe"
3332,2020-12-11 22:47:04,kavu8a,Also there's literal decades of comic stories and characters they can use to the point that it can be a new story for each show and they would still have enough a decade later. They haven't even *touched* Xmen yet. And that's a whole other basket of worms that can introduce a ridiculous amount of content on its own

3336,2020-12-12 17:04:04,kavu8a,"Not even kind of close. Just look where the numbers will be in a year. There’s ones piece of content that streaming audiences will care about and that Is WW. Disney+ just announced a battalion of fan friendly content. 

Hbo max will be closer to Quibi than Disney+"
3337,2020-12-11 22:15:53,kavu8a,Agreed. I loved the first season but so far the only episodes of season two I enjoyed were the first two. They felt self-contained.
3338,2020-12-11 05:56:05,kavu8a,And Avatar
3339,2020-12-11 15:06:42,kavu8a,And all of them were canon before Disney came in.
3340,2020-12-11 14:11:42,kavu8a,Reddit has spoken.

I'd say more mixed than terrible. Sequel Trilogy and Solo are pretty bad. But The Mandalorian, Clone Wars: The Final Season, and Star Wars Rebels are all pretty great."
3346,2020-12-11 05:42:04,kavu8a,Tis but a bit of Uncle Scrooge's vault.
3347,2020-12-11 12:48:01,kavu8a,"Oh that's just all part of it. Goes into the whole ""not planning ahead"" aspect. But we digress, it's going too far off-topic.

I just feel that Hollywood hasn't really churned out a lot of truly original work in the last few decades, and it seems to be getting worse and worse with the double-down on exploiting established brands."

3351,2020-12-11 16:43:57,kavu8a,"Well yes because it is true. It was the star wars fandom which harassed actors and actresses because they didn't like a fictional character, it was them who couldn't deal with brie larson being a little critical of certain hollywood standards, it was them who cried like little babies when they didn't like a film and wanted to destroy the lifes of people involved. All of that is more edgelord mentality than being aware that a lot of entertainment is incredibly mediocre while producing more and more money with it, you don't need to be a reddit warrior to see it, a lot of people point this out, including legendary directors and artists."
3352,2020-12-11 06:10:47,kavu8a,And my Axe!
3353,2020-12-11 08:19:04,kavu8a,"They speak only of Star Wars there. Otherwise, they got plenty of other things. In fact, I don't think they really decreased their number of theatrical films while upping massively the production for Disney+ original content. There will still be 3 MCU movies a year for example.

Btw, it is weird how they didn't even mention Avatar 2 and 3 in that presentation."
3354,2020-12-11 15:08:01,kavu8a,"Well, yes and no. They were all canon to each other, but George certainly didn’t consider them part of his story. 

Not saying that as a bad thing about the EU - just how it was."

3358,2020-12-11 20:24:38,kavu8a,Hmmm... that's fair. I didn't even think about the two animated series. (which reminds me that I need to check out Rebels)
3359,2020-12-12 02:18:11,kavu8a,Do you like Doctor Strange because the Sorcerer Supreme is kind of like a Grand Wizard?
3360,2020-12-11 22:55:49,kavu8a,Harassing actors is not exclusive to the Marvel and Star Wars fandoms.
3361,2020-12-11 09:21:59,kavu8a,Avatar is still  theatrical vehicle.  Apparently James Cameron even has new projectors for theaters where they'll actually project in 3D so you don't even need glasses.
3362,2020-12-12 02:52:55,kavu8a,Never seen it
3363,2020-12-11 23:12:10,kavu8a,"Sure, i also shouldn't have used the qualifier ""most"", but i think it is fairly accurate to say that these big, nerdy spheres have a good amount of edgelords in them, though maybe edgelord might not be the perfect descriptor for what i have in mind.  
  
Being aware how big corporations work and where the general trend lies when it comes to the entertainment industry, well i don't think that's quite as out there tbh. As i said, big artists oftentimes share these sentiments because, well, it's true. (though tbf, the comment of the guy wasn't great, but it's in a reasonable thread and only added to that tbh)"
3364,2020-12-11 09:39:00,kavu8a,Yeah of course but they still spoke of plenty of theatrical content in that show. All the MCU movies are still theatrical only and coming to Disney+ only months later (like presumably Avatar sequels)
3365,2020-12-11 09:53:40,kavu8a,"I don't know the background of the event, but I'm assuming it was strictly related to Disney+ content.  All the stuff listed above are all Disney+ streaming content."
3366,2020-12-11 14:15:33,kavu8a,It wasn't strictly disney+ ( the event )
3367,2020-12-11 21:22:54,kavu8a,Gotcha.
3368,2020-12-11 07:01:10,kavrwz,"So, I guess their goal today was to take everyone who said D+ had no original content besides The Mandalorian, and pretty much punch them in the face repeatedly."

3373,2020-12-11 06:52:35,kavrwz,/u/arashtp you missed Percy Jackson.
3374,2020-12-11 05:05:30,kavrwz,Super stoked on most of this. I’m especially looking forward to the Nat geo content. Can you imagine if Disney+ dropped with half of these titles? Game changer
3375,2020-12-11 13:06:41,kavrwz,"Based on the release timelines of those shows, it looks like their strategy is: 

Zeitgeist show for 6 weeks -> 1 week of cool down —> couple weeks of hype up -> next Zeitgeist show -> Repeat"
3376,2020-12-11 07:25:29,kavrwz,They're really going all out with the High Republic.
3377,2020-12-11 05:50:31,kavrwz,did She Hulk get a trailer or anything?
3378,2020-12-11 10:15:17,kavrwz,that's a lot of content
3379,2020-12-11 19:04:19,kavrwz,"So strange to realize Ice Age is owned by Disney now. 

Also I’m sort of unexpectedly excited about the continuation of Mighty Ducks!"
3380,2020-12-11 13:13:06,kavrwz,A Turner and Hooch reboot yyyeeeeessss!!! I've been a fan (we call ourselves Hoochers) for years and am flipping out right now!!!!
3381,2020-12-11 13:29:08,kavrwz,Missing rogue squadron on Star Wars
3382,2020-12-11 13:46:42,kavrwz,Hocus Pocus 2. What.
3383,2020-12-11 14:10:46,kavrwz,"A lot of this is awesome, but can I just take a moment to appreciate *Sister Act 3*?"

3386,2020-12-11 13:10:21,kavrwz,I have only read a hand full of moon knight comics but from what I have heard and read making a PG moon knight show is not going to go over well with fans.
3387,2020-12-11 16:20:59,kavrwz,Any specific dates to go with this?
3388,2020-12-11 19:53:29,kavrwz,You forgot the multiple tongue in cheek references to Matt Murdock.  Charlie Cox's Daredevil is officially part of the MCU now.  Hes apparently in She Hulk and Spider-Man 3.
3389,2020-12-12 01:10:08,kavrwz,"Damn, the Ducks end up becoming what they rebelled against..."
3390,2020-12-11 05:18:44,kavrwz,"As a bi dude I'm still waiting for literally anything big that features a non-straight dude. In film they ignored it almost completely out of fear of gay-hating countries banning it and them losing money (like China). 

Really hoping for something to come through, maybe with x-men back in the fold Iceman could get something"
3391,2020-12-11 08:21:15,kavrwz,So is Ahsoka taking the place of the Rebels spinoff? Because thats what I was most excited for
3392,2020-12-11 16:46:16,kavrwz,Disney is milking Star Wars and Marvel for everything dollar they can squeeze. There are way too many reboots and remakes. They need originally sourced content that has no reliance on existing IP. How about some original NON-Marvel/Star Wars scripted content? I think the Mandalorian is a cute show but I want to see ORIGINAL content for once. This slate of shows are not enough to keep all of their subscribers satisfied.
3393,2020-12-11 17:11:28,kavrwz,Seems like Star Wars's future is on TV.
3394,2020-12-11 18:02:53,kavrwz,Is it weird that I'm most excited for the Josh Peck version of Turner and Hooch?
3395,2020-12-11 20:26:03,kavrwz,"Looks like they're updating Microcosmos with A Real Bug's Life, that should be cool as fuck."
3396,2020-12-11 21:23:43,kavrwz,">The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers

>Lauren Graham (Gilmore Girls, Parenthood) and Emilio Estevez (reprising his role from the original feature films) star in the next chapter of the hit Mighty Ducks franchise, premiering in early 2021. In present day Minnesota, the Mighty Ducks have evolved from scrappy underdogs to an ultra-competitive, powerhouse youth hockey team. After 12-year-old Evan is unceremoniously cut from the Ducks, he and his mom Alex set out to build their own ragtag team of misfits to challenge the cutthroat, win-at-all-costs culture of competitive youth sports.

I hope Disney has been paying attn to Cobra Kai and takes all the good from it and applies it to the Ducks!!!"
3397,2020-12-12 04:36:12,kavrwz,"Man, Tony Stark cannot keep control of his tech, can he? Well, I guess he's dead, so that makes sense."
3398,2020-12-21 17:14:28,kavrwz,The one thing I want from Marvel is an OG Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos show.
3399,2021-02-19 11:23:43,kavrwz,They forgot Shadow Hunters.
3400,2020-12-11 15:19:07,kavrwz,I just want to have the spin off Thrawn and Ezra travels in space show.
3401,2020-12-11 10:48:48,kavrwz,so much content that post alone made me vomit .
3402,2020-12-11 05:32:35,kavrwz,"Hey, bozo, why didn't you mention It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia?

Great list, otherwise."
3403,2020-12-11 09:03:23,kavrwz,Disney+ launch was more like beta test to ensure their decision of allocating such resources to the platform
3404,2020-12-12 15:49:44,kavrwz,"The criticism was regarding lack of original screenplays, too. It's still true in that aspect."
3405,2020-12-11 11:00:18,kavrwz,"It's still lacks diversity, it's still marvel, star wars and Pixar animated pg-13 movies, still no new new IPs."

3409,2020-12-11 05:02:38,kavrwz,"Just hints at Daredevil, from Sony in Spider-Man 3 and at the reveal here today for She-Hulk."
3410,2020-12-11 14:47:15,kavrwz,"Yeah sounds like the Multiverse in SM3 will pull in Daredevil and Kingpin. Which could be great.

Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk, and there have been rumors that DNofrio has campaigned hard and they’ve taken him seriously as maybe using his character to put together the Sinister Six."
3411,2020-12-11 17:37:50,kavrwz,"There's a big hint in Hawkeye. Maya Lopez is a definitively Daredevil character (Echo, a deaf woman who can see something once and imitate it originally hired by Kingpin to take out Daredevil and eventually befriending him). She also wore the Ronin outfit for awhile that Hawkeye wore in Endgame after his family vanished (New Avengers comics).

Edit: why am I being downvoted for this?"
3412,2020-12-11 20:43:43,kavrwz,Thanks man you're awesome

3415,2020-12-11 20:53:16,kavrwz,And Swiss Family Robinson.
3416,2020-12-11 14:41:22,kavrwz,It’s pretty genius
3417,2020-12-11 14:51:57,kavrwz,Super into the Acolyte as I’d really like to see what the Sith/dark side users were up to during this time period
3418,2020-12-11 06:39:39,kavrwz,"No, but they confirmed Tatiana Maslany."
3419,2020-12-11 16:21:20,kavrwz,Tim Roth will be back as Abomination and Mark Ruffalo.
3420,2020-12-12 02:56:32,kavrwz,Its a rather deceptive line if your not in the know.  WDAS is the movie studio. Disney Television Animation is the studio that typically handles the TV side (they were the ones that made the Tangled series).
3421,2020-12-11 13:35:16,kavrwz,That's not necessarily a bad thing tbh. It's how they execute it that matters. GOTG was kinda considered a bottom of the barrel IP for marvel before they made it and it turned out well.
3422,2020-12-11 23:07:07,kavrwz,"There’s like 70 announced shows here and less than 10 are actual original ideas. Really disappointing *in my opinion*.

I get people like Star Wars and stuff, but it seems extreme to me."
3423,2020-12-11 19:28:47,kavrwz,"I think it could be done. For me at least the fun part is the mind-bendy unreliable narrator stuff and not the graphic violence. Although there is something to be said for when other characters meet Moon Knight and are like, ""oh this guy is *crazy* crazy and not just *Batman* crazy."""
3424,2020-12-11 06:00:15,kavrwz,"This didn’t mention any of the Marvel movies since it’s still not certain whether they’ll be released in theaters first or on Disney+ at the same time, but The Eternals is set to have their first openly gay main character whenever that’s released.

If you haven’t watched the Disney+ short film Out, you absolutely should."
3425,2020-12-11 05:55:44,kavrwz,"Young Avengers is just over the horizon, and that comes with the most prominent gay couple in marvel. Still a few years out though."
3426,2020-12-11 15:23:22,kavrwz,Not sure if it is 100% confirmed but I remember seeing somewhere that Valkyrie is looking for a wife in the next Thor movie.
3427,2020-12-11 12:51:46,kavrwz,"As a fellow homo, I'm sorry you're getting downvoted, but that's r/television for you. I've learned not to bring up representation issues on this sub anymore."
3428,2020-12-11 14:52:52,kavrwz,"I would bet it will be in a team, or they will reveal the character is gay in a sequel...that way people in China will already be invested.  Because you’re right....they want that China money badly. 


Wouldn’t it be a kick in the nuts to China if the wait until like Shang Chi 3 and reveal he was gay the whole time! Lmao. That could literally start a war!!"
3429,2020-12-21 17:11:41,kavrwz,I really don't like the sound of this. The whole point of the Ducks is that they are scrappy underdogs. Having them become what they played against feels kind of weird. And it's obviously gonna end with both Ducks teams playing against each other. It just sounds weird to me.
3430,2020-12-11 19:29:54,kavrwz,"I feel like this'll be a big part of the Ashoka show, considering that she was still searching when we see her in The Mandolorian."
3431,2020-12-11 14:41:40,kavrwz,That’s pathetic
3432,2020-12-11 07:27:47,kavrwz,Thats not on Disney+ you 1 star fool.
3433,2020-12-11 13:49:31,kavrwz,"They're going all in because they've lost all profits from Disney parks and tourism, 75% of their revenue.

Also why they gutted ESPN"
3434,2020-12-13 05:16:02,kavrwz,"Certainly, but was anyone really expecting that? Aside from Pixar, Disney hasn't done an original story in... I'm not sure. Possibly ever."
3435,2020-12-11 12:53:02,kavrwz,Pixar films are all new IPs lol
3436,2020-12-11 12:29:02,kavrwz,[deleted]
3437,2020-12-12 00:56:24,kavrwz,One Star Wars IP will drive more total interest than anything on HBO Max lmao
3438,2020-12-11 19:07:00,kavrwz,"Uh ""Win or Lose"" is a new IP."
3439,2020-12-11 13:53:27,kavrwz,"You are soo right. Marvel has been overdone, it's a stale medium at this point.  SW feels the same after the last 3 movies. Even Mando is aimless with no real main plotline.

It's so formulaic it isn't appealing.

Will smith movie,
Cars tv show, 
SW, SW, SW, SW, SW
Marvel movies or shows of all side movie characters, because why not saturate the market with bland superheros"
3440,2020-12-11 19:37:28,kavrwz,"Yeah. Did anyone really expect Disney to do something genuinely new? Aside from Pixar, which still has very niche content, I can't remember the last time Disney did an actually new story. 

It's one of the reasons this obsession people on here have with D+ ""killing"" Netflix is so silly."
3441,2020-12-11 14:10:10,kavrwz,Well original content in this context means content that is developed specificity for the platform and is owned by Disney
3442,2020-12-11 15:00:36,kavrwz,"
>Daredevil was hinted at strongly for SheHulk...

That doesn't excite me...  I don't see Daredevil remaining dark and gritty if placed in She-Hulk.  SH over the years has been more of a fun loving character."
3443,2020-12-11 19:24:09,kavrwz,"It's going to be interesting to see how Tim Roth plays his take on Mark Ruffalo.

They a announced it today, as well.

It actually appears on traditional broadcast television, anyone who can't see this **IS A SAVAGE AND AN IDIOT**.

Stoked about almost all of these, though."
3446,2020-12-11 14:08:01,kavrwz,Most of these projects are planned before the COVID
3447,2020-12-11 16:07:06,kavrwz,Different services provide different content. I dont see why that's only an issue when it's Disney. How much Oscar winning animated content do we see on HBO or Netflix?
3448,2020-12-12 02:30:02,kavrwz,Duh.  If you want Disney's adult content you mosey over to Hulu.  If you've been looking at the end of the year critics' lists you'll have noticed Disney is beating Netflix and Warnerbrothers decisively when it comes to critical acclaim.
3449,2020-12-12 00:55:57,kavrwz,Disney doesn’t give a fuck about that. They care about commercial success of which they aren’t matched.
3450,2020-12-11 19:53:58,kavrwz,The show is listed as a comedy. Not sure how Charlie's Matt Murdock would fit into that.
3451,2020-12-11 14:50:52,kavrwz,"I get it. But AntMan seemed really dumb to me. So did Thor at the time, and GotG is when I thought they had given up. 

I think the Series will be used to set up bigger events in the movies.  Almost like a Rogue One to Star Wars.  

That way people who want more background will have it, and yet you don’t HAVE to have seen it to follow the movies.  

Also Ironheart, Kate Bishop, Ms Marvel and I’m betting a Young Loki will get set up for a Secret Avengers movie."
3452,2020-12-11 14:40:54,kavrwz,"Armor Wars is widely considered one of the best, if not the best period, Iron Man stories.

We’ll most likely see Justin Hammer return and the intro of some other big Iron Man villains like Crimson Dynamo.

I wouldn’t call it bottom of the barrel. The only difference is that War Machine will he finally getting the spotlight rather than Iron Man"
3453,2020-12-11 14:57:18,kavrwz,"Well, you have to remember, when they first started making Marvel movies, Iron Man was a very odd choice in how to begin."
3454,2020-12-11 17:12:16,kavrwz,Yes.  Can they only make outer space/superhero stuff?  That’s not the only genre.
3455,2020-12-08 20:31:06,k9bwkm,"She says this about her character:

“I do feel like I can relate to her. I can’t say much about the role, but I can say that she is thrust into a world where she doesn’t really know what to do. At the same time, she’s discovering things about herself.”"
3456,2020-12-08 21:07:21,k9bwkm,Can we please get some concept art for this film?
3457,2020-12-09 15:27:42,k9bwkm,Hmm. That doesn’t sound like it’s Mandarin’s daughter
3458,2020-12-08 21:27:00,k9bwkm,Well obviously she will be the loud and obnoxious comic relief character.
3459,2020-12-09 01:07:36,k9bwkm,Wow that sounds like a character
3460,2020-12-08 23:18:21,k9bwkm,"I posted about this a few days ago but it never went anywhere.  If you go to agbosuperheroleague.com and scroll down to Simu Liu, there’s a picture of Shang Chi I’ve never seen before. Dunno whether it’s concept art or just fan art that they did something with."
3461,2020-12-09 07:02:07,k9bwkm,"I'm assuming you're missing a /s, but take note of her performance in The Farewell-- it won a historic Golden Globe for Best Actress."
3462,2020-12-08 21:40:48,k9bwkm,"Just because actors/actresses play a certain role all the time, doesn’t necessarily mean that they’ll always play that role.


Take Seth Rogan or Adam Sandler for instance. Both play comedic relief characters constantly but then get serious roles where they’re acting truly shines, hence the Steve Jobs true story movie and Uncut Gems."
3463,2020-12-09 02:50:28,k9bwkm,Sounds like she definitely played a character in this movie
3464,2020-12-09 00:31:42,k9bwkm,Yikes. This is almost a woosh moment for you and many others.

When someone says ""discovering things about self"" in a fantasy/comic book movie, he has superpowers. Rest indicates a captive of the terrorism or an extraterrestrial."

3469,2020-12-08 20:27:46,k9bwb9,"Love the enthusiasm. But thing is that that's the most generic way to describe an arc so it could be literally anything. As in ""throw you character in an unfamiliar situation so they discover something about themselves"" is literally a step in the Hero's Journey."
3470,2020-12-08 23:30:11,k9bwb9,She used to be a comedian/rapper so it was meant to be a play on rapper names. Then she became better known by than name rather than her real name so she stuck with it
3471,2020-12-08 22:38:14,k9bwb9,You’re talking about her so I guess it worked.
3472,2020-12-08 23:59:26,k9bwb9,"Was her youtube alias. She got big under that name. It's kind of like how The Rock still gets called ""The Rock"" sometimes. He got famous as one thing and had to take a lot of time and effort to market himself into  Dwayne Johnson instead. For a long time, no one would know who ""Dwyane Johnson: is. But if you said the same sentance, but with ""The Rock"", they'd know almost immediately. Same situation for her. Her real name is Nora Lum, but you aren't gonna see that anywhere. More than likely she won't campaign for something else since she won't have the same pull in the market as The Rock would."

3605,2020-12-05 16:56:30,k77lqo,Didn’t Tatiana Maslany say she wasn’t going to be She-Hulk?
3606,2020-12-05 17:02:36,k77lqo,I can see Christian Bale playing Dario Agger in Thor since he was the main villain of The Mighty Thor series.
3607,2020-12-05 17:21:25,k77lqo,god i am so looking forward to all of this

Jack Veal and Cailey Fleming are strongly rumoured to play Young Loki and Sylvie (source: their instagram activity and interaction)"

3615,2020-12-05 18:19:50,k77lqo,Lotta shit gonna be our next year.
3616,2020-12-05 18:20:08,k77lqo,Is it just me who thinks Adam warlock will be (one of) the villain(s) of love and thunder?
3617,2020-12-05 18:21:17,k77lqo,I’m very surprised they’re continuing with another black panther movie... they must be convinced they can successfully write the late Mr. Boseman out of the story. I wonder if another character will become the black panther.
3618,2020-12-05 18:21:22,k77lqo,"Idk if this would go under Doctor Strange, Captain Marvel or just “Other”

But it’s all but guaranteed that America Chavez is apart of Phase 4/5. With the biggest rumor being she’ll be appearing in Doctor Strange. And the most likely rumor being she’ll have a crush on Captain Marvel. 

Idk how substantial the rumors will be but the 2nd comes from a source that has already had a few Disney rumors come true. 

Could also note that with Kate Bishop, Ms Marvel, and America Chavez all confirmed that means one of the untitled Marvel Productions could easily be Young Avengers. (Obviously that part is clearly a big IF but still)"

Also surprised they didn't have a backup script already, seeing as his cancer and decline was known to the studio and fellow actors."

3627,2020-12-05 19:07:20,k77lqo,Lots of movies in 2022. Almost too many. I love marvel but I don't want to get lost in the shuffle.
3628,2020-12-05 19:10:07,k77lqo,I didn’t realize MCU fans were gonna be eating this well in 2021! So many shows and movies after a year of none. Can’t wait!

I was under the impression it was the first official non-canonical MCU property."

3633,2020-12-05 19:50:08,k77lqo,Neither Deadpool 3 nor Blade have confirmed release-years.
3634,2020-12-05 19:51:03,k77lqo,Do we know if Chadwick Boseman recorded lines for What If? before he passed?
3635,2020-12-05 19:52:12,k77lqo,"Forgot Erin Kellyman as Songbird in Falcon & Winter Soldier, she was spotted on set so it's confirmed. Same goes for Clint's family in Hawkeye"
3636,2020-12-05 19:55:02,k77lqo,"2020 was a tough drought. Thankful for AoS ending so well but can’t wait for the splurge of content hitting us in 2021 and then not slowing down again. 

I hope Feige and others don’t burnout once things pick back up."
3637,2020-12-05 20:03:39,k77lqo,"Wow lots of cool stuff here that I had no clue about.

Evan Peters as Quicksilver in Wandavision? That’s really crazy and I’m curious if he’s somehow going to be a continuation of QS from the X-Men movies? His version of QS and the Deadpool franchise characters are the only confirmed uses of FOX’s X-Men characters under Marvel Studios correct? Really interesting.

I feel like Spider-Man 3 is gonna be *weird* (in a good way) if Dr.Strange, Foxx’s Electro, and the two previous Spider-Man’s are all gonna be in it."
3638,2020-12-05 20:06:09,k77lqo,"I can't believe we have to wait till November next year to see Eternals. Sigh, that's my current most hyped upcoming marvel movie"
3639,2020-12-05 20:14:19,k77lqo,There is no end to this. If there's not a movie to watch there's probably a show. It's gonna get real difficult to keep up with this now. But if movies are released on Disney+ then people will stay subscribed for years without having to worry about content.
3640,2020-12-05 20:29:02,k77lqo,"Great write-up. The only thing I would add, with a disclaimer, are Wardell scoops."
3641,2020-12-05 20:34:30,k77lqo,"Budapest must be told as a story, because as far as I'm aware Jeremy Renner isn't in the movie, so it wouldn't make sense to do a flashback"
3642,2020-12-05 20:39:27,k77lqo,I’m really excited for Eternals.
3643,2020-12-05 20:42:49,k77lqo,Can we take a moment to appreciate so many actors remaining in this long-running series for so many years? It just wouldn’t be the same without them.
3644,2020-12-05 20:45:51,k77lqo,This is incredible! Thanks for doing this. One quick note would be to mention that Sam Raimi is directing the next Dr Strange film as its kindova cool link to the previous Spiderman iterations- albeit probably unrelated to the story or characters.
3645,2020-12-05 20:54:53,k77lqo,*Loki* sounds like it could be *Doctor Who*-esque

3649,2020-12-05 21:20:29,k77lqo,Christian Bale casted in Thor love and thunder we just don’t know as who yet. Hopefully Gorr
3650,2020-12-05 21:21:36,k77lqo,it makes me so happy that with pretty much every actor in hollywood getting a role in the MCU tom cruise still hasn't got his murder cult stink over it.
3651,2020-12-05 21:25:52,k77lqo,"Meh. I think I’m done, to be honest."
3652,2020-12-05 21:29:53,k77lqo,"Ms. Marvel is shooting as we speak in Atlanta. How do I know this for 100% fact? My dad, who retired a few years ago, decided he wanted to sign up to be an extra in various productions. He was in an Aretha Franklin docuseries as a priest in the background, and a few weeks ago he was a Muslim mosque-goer for - guess what - Ms Marvel. 

They had all the extras wearing those little bracelets like the Lance Armstrong on that say Jersey. I know this because he gave it to me and now I’m never taking it off. 

He said he saw the actress playing Ms Marvel on the set, but wasn’t in a scene with her.

I should note the filming took place in a church or mosque in East Point Atlanta."
3653,2020-12-05 21:31:04,k77lqo,"I’m so psyched for What If, even more so than the other series. But the three listed premises are totally uninspiring imo, especially the zombie one. There’s so much cool stuff that could be done with it."
3654,2020-12-05 21:31:11,k77lqo,2022 looks amazing. Waiting for Black widow in 2021 seems like the low bar.
3655,2020-12-05 21:45:04,k77lqo,Great post.  Thank you for collating all that information.
3656,2020-12-05 21:49:32,k77lqo,I find the lack of Defenders...  disturbing.
3657,2020-12-05 21:52:25,k77lqo,"Assuming nothing gets pushed back further, 2021 seems jam-packed with Marvel. Although Black Widow seems a little too near in the future.


Also, I forgot we were getting Blade!"
3658,2020-12-05 22:15:10,k77lqo,Seems unlikely that Chadwick Boseman is gonna be in the What If show

Probably I wouldn’t have wanted that if Chadwick Boseman hadn’t died, but the character was so good and redemption wasn’t out of the question."

I’m not sure if this is worth adding, but there were rumours for Doctor Strange 2 also featuring Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield as part of the cast with Ryan Reynolds. Is this worth adding to the “rumoured” portion of the post? 

If not, since the involvement of these two pre-Holland Spider-Man actors has been continually mentioned, there’s a chance it could just be in Spider-Man 3. (Yet I think DS2 is a better chance since it’s a multiverse storyline)"

That the show will feature multiple ""hulks"" possibly Ross turning into Red Hulk, Abomination return, and Bruce coming in for either a cameo or mentor role. You can obviously look more into this online but I trust Grace Randolph as a reporter. 

Also small thing Florence Pugh will also be in Falcon and Winter Soldier."

Here’s hoping Marvel Studios/Feige can pull something worthy of the mantle together out of what currently reads like a lot of loosely connected odds and ends."

And that article didn’t even have a source, it was just like “oh RDJ will be in the movie too” which was very random. Everyone’s been taking it as gospel but at the very least you should call it an unsubstantiated rumor bc it’s not at all “all but confirmed.” It wouldn’t even make sense for his final appearance to be in Black Widow anyway, unless it’s like in Far From Home when they reused a clip.

3748,2020-12-06 09:20:36,k77lqo,"Though no directors are mentioned on your post, I think it’s relevant to add that Sam Raimi is confirmed to head Doctor Strange 2 after Scott Derrickson dropped out. This also substantiates the idea of a horror plot lurking beneath the surface of the movie due to Raimi’s specialty (and passion) for horror.

Also, I’ve been avoiding rumors for a while now so I can’t tell you if either of these are debunked or even maybe less proeminent, but i vaguely remember Krysten Ritter being rumored to also be in the Captain Marvel cast as well as Charlie Cox on Spider-Man 3. Thought that might just be because people want those so badly they talk about it too much and I’m mistaking wishful thinking for rumors."

3755,2020-12-05 23:44:55,k77lqo,Now they have Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek to name some who I wouldn’t think would be in the MCU.

3761,2020-12-05 21:21:06,k77lqo,"I actually think covid and this enforced hiatus between Endgame and the start of the new phases is a boon for the MCU. Allows the general audience some down time from the movies and gives Marvel a chance to really work on their plans and make sure they've got everything as tight as can be.

Also allows for mutant planning and gave them some breathing room with BP2 after Boseman's death."
3762,2020-12-05 18:56:21,k77lqo,It will be nice when we get SIX movies in 2022 though. We will have forgotten all about not seeing them for awhile and then will have one every 2-3 months after Black Widow drops (save the 4 month gal between Shang Chi and Eternals).
3763,2020-12-05 21:46:13,k77lqo,Black Widow could easily be streamed on Disney+ so idk why they didn’t just release it there. If Warner bros is releasing all the movies on HBO Max why can’t Disney release one movie?
3764,2020-12-05 21:48:12,k77lqo,Knowing that everyone lost a year of their lives really sucks :/

2. Fair, you're right, I'll strikethrough it"
3776,2020-12-06 02:11:03,k77lqo,Did the director not say when Chadwick passed that he had to throw out the script he was working on?
3777,2020-12-05 17:27:42,k77lqo,"They've confirmed they aren't recasting T'Challa, nor using a CGI Chadwick, so they've got a lot of modification to do. May as well count it as a new script."
3778,2020-12-06 07:52:18,k77lqo,Feige said at SDCC 2019 that some of it would be mid-blip & some of it would be post-blip.
3779,2020-12-05 19:53:23,k77lqo,"between wanda vision and the second dr strange movie, i feel like phase 4's big plot point is going to be the multiverse, with my guess is that using the infinity stones twice [one to wipe out half the universe, and again to wipe the stones out] then the time travel to use the stones again [one to reverse what thanos did, and two, to wipe him and his entire empire from existence] i have a feeling that such massive manipulations to the powers that govern all of reality are going to affect the multiverse in unpredictable ways"

3788,2020-12-07 22:16:56,k77lqo,"Back in 2018 I thought he’d make a fantastic Adam Warlock, maybe that’s the role? It would make sense to cameo Warlock if he’s going to eventually show up in GOTG3"

3793,2020-12-05 17:19:32,k77lqo,Isn’t Far From Home in 2024 since it’s the summer after the school year after Endgame?
3794,2020-12-05 17:28:39,k77lqo,"I think your point still stands, but FFH was actually set in 2024."
3795,2020-12-06 03:32:36,k77lqo,I think at least part of Shang-Chi will occur in between the snap

3807,2020-12-05 15:32:26,k77lqo,"Complete rumours mate, nothing substantiated"
3808,2020-12-05 17:48:01,k77lqo,"Yes. I think what some 'spoiler free' people have problems with is some of us like knowing things ahead of time and approach it with more of a 'How are they going to pull THAT off?' anticipation. We're more interested in how things fit together rather than in any big surprise. I don't know if that makes any sense to the 'no spoilers under any circumstance' fans, but it is what it is. 

So for me, anyway, knowing something ahead of time ruins nothing for me."
3809,2020-12-05 17:35:22,k77lqo,"I don't to be honest, I prefer as much surprise as possible, but it's been that long since we've got anything I needed something substantial, hence this post. Once things start coming back out consistently, I'll stop listening to rumours"
3810,2020-12-05 22:03:48,k77lqo,"I personally hate it, and it does affect me when it's played out on screen.

Example, I had no idea Falcon was gonna be in Ant-Man until I saw Ant-Man. It was a huge deal, I was NOT expecting it.

But imagine if I did, instead I would have been like ""There he is. Just as the internet said."" instead of ""WOAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!""

The unfortunate thing is that this is super rare nowadays, because of leaks and stuff and then people spread it around. 

But thank you very much for the surprise, it's the effort that counts. I just wish someone would catch whoever leaks it in the first place. Breaking NDA's are not cool."
3811,2020-12-05 19:15:32,k77lqo,"Unless it's a huge spoiler, like Kylo killing Han (which was spoiled for me), then I don't mind them too much. Seeing it actually happen, how it's tied into the story, and the fall out from it, is usually the best part."

A few years ago they added a new character that was a teenager that looked up to her, and took over the name Ms Marvel. They're really pushing her as the new spiderman (""the"" teenage character in marvel). She's in the disastrous Avengers game that came out a few months ago. Stretchy powers, I think.

3841,2020-12-05 23:26:00,k77lqo,Thank you!
3842,2020-12-05 23:58:08,k77lqo,Thanks! I've edited it
3843,2020-12-06 00:29:42,k77lqo,Talk to the mods chief
3844,2020-12-06 08:14:35,k77lqo,"Yeah, I don't recall any confirmation of who she's playing in the movie."
3845,2020-12-11 08:47:22,k77lqo,"Thanks, I'll update this post asap"
3846,2021-02-28 13:59:40,k77lqo,"I'll probably update this after WandaVision finishes, can't see too many eyes getting on this post anymore though"
3847,2020-12-05 15:38:11,k77lqo,"Why? It takes place between CA:CW and Infinity War, it would make sense that he’d at least make a flashback appearance or a very brief cameo."
3848,2020-12-05 16:32:08,k77lqo,some are saying it is a cameo like in some detailed news clip or something like that.
3849,2020-12-05 17:40:49,k77lqo,"The rumor was that they had a deleted scene from Civil War, so technically RDJ's final appearance as Stark would still be Endgame, as the BW appearance would have been films years ago."
3850,2020-12-05 15:49:20,k77lqo,"Given the Letitia Wright controversy at the minute, it seems like the best course of action to me"
3851,2020-12-05 16:52:18,k77lqo,"At this point, I’d love alternate universe MBJ that was raised in Wakanda. M’Baku would be cool too though."
3852,2020-12-05 17:15:50,k77lqo,MBaku would be one buff a** BPanther and i love it. Would also love for him to return to CW BPanther without as much tech help. Make him a beast of a fighter.
3853,2020-12-05 16:49:11,k77lqo,"Pretty sure it’s canon, just different universes than the main timeline."
3854,2020-12-05 15:40:40,k77lqo,"But with the exploration of alternate timelines in Avengers: Endgame, those other timelines are technically canonical in the multiverse"
3855,2020-12-05 15:30:22,k77lqo,"I'd say eventually, I'm holding out hope they won't rush it into this one though, maybe set it up though"
3856,2020-12-05 17:16:27,k77lqo,"Completely agreed. It also wouldn't make much sense for them to make Deadpool 3 an MCU movie since they wanna keep the PG-13 rating which would ruin the character. And if they decide to make it an MCU movie, even if it was rated R, parents would see it and think it'll be family friendly like the other marvel stuff and take their kids to see it. I don't think marvel would wanna make that sacrifice so it seems more likely that it will stay in a different universe. Not to mention Josh Brolin playing both Thanos and Cable in the same universe."
3857,2020-12-05 16:01:15,k77lqo,"She's deleted her account, I imagine she'll come back having learnt her lesson and a heartfelt apology and a renegotiated contract"
3858,2020-12-05 17:55:19,k77lqo,"Yes, he did"
3859,2020-12-05 18:08:20,k77lqo,Apparently so
3860,2020-12-05 16:12:08,k77lqo,"Likely alternate timelines, I imagine MoM will help them explain it away"
3861,2020-12-05 16:35:23,k77lqo,"I'd say Phase 5 at the earliest, after F4 and XMen have been introduced"
3862,2020-12-05 16:36:42,k77lqo,"Last we heard from Feige, he said after Hawkeye, and with that show being pushed back to late 2021, I took an educated guess at 2022"
3863,2020-12-05 16:40:16,k77lqo,"Yep, I said at the bottom there that the names of the movies may not be ""X-Men"" and ""Fantastic Four"", but they will feature characters from those series"
3864,2020-12-05 16:41:08,k77lqo,Added!
3865,2020-12-05 17:09:34,k77lqo,"Unfortunately not, they have confirmed his children are returning with set photos without Linda"
3866,2020-12-05 17:43:47,k77lqo,Paul Rudd said he wasn't doing Ant-Man.
3867,2020-12-05 17:56:08,k77lqo,Hailee Steinfeld said she wasn’t Kate Bishop
3868,2020-12-05 17:11:21,k77lqo,"A day before the official announcement, as far as I saw"
3869,2020-12-05 17:39:43,k77lqo,Thanks! Could you link a source for me? I've had to add and delete few pieces taken from comments already
3870,2020-12-05 18:19:31,k77lqo,"Technically he is playing Electro again, but whether it's a reboot of the character or not, is unknown"
3871,2020-12-05 18:22:13,k77lqo,"I think they'll make a killing, if not just from morbid curiosity"
3872,2020-12-06 08:10:19,k77lqo,"The show ended very well. I'd love to see somebody come back in a cameo or supporting role, but they don't need their own project anymore."
3873,2020-12-05 18:40:56,k77lqo,Apparently there was never a script pre-Chadwick's passing
3874,2020-12-05 18:41:45,k77lqo,"Did they? I didn't see that, could you link it and I'll add it?"
3875,2020-12-05 19:01:30,k77lqo,"I don't believe so, Chris Pratt was confirmed for Thor 4 but if you have a source I'll add it!"
3876,2020-12-06 08:11:45,k77lqo,"Given GotG 3's troubled history (it was intended to be the first film after FFH until Gunn's temporary firing), it's highly *likely* that he was *originally* going to be in it, but we've never had any confirmation."
3877,2020-12-05 19:35:36,k77lqo,"https://www.marvel.com/characters/beta-ray-bill

Here's a pretty in-depth look at him"
3878,2020-12-05 19:17:28,k77lqo,"There likely won't be that many, but those are the only confirmed dates I could find"

FTFY ;)"

3893,2020-12-06 01:12:20,k77lqo,"Yes. There might not be a Fantastic Four movie in Phase 5 if they focus on origin movies first.


Thank you for subscribing to Fantastic Four Facts"
3894,2020-12-06 11:10:26,k77lqo,"They have to keep the franchise running for as long as they can, they way I see it they'll complete a few arcs of the heroes we know and love before throwing failsafes into the mix, they know even the casual fans will go and see X-Men return to the mix, so they may as well leave it as long as they can


& JJJ was in Far From Home!"
3895,2020-12-06 08:15:47,k77lqo,"It's been strongly implied that you'll need WandaVision to fully get Multiverse of Madness, and people *assume* that you'll need Loki to get Love & Thunder, but in general, probably not."
3896,2020-12-06 11:12:42,k77lqo,"According to Feige, Wandavision will lead into MoM, Falcon & The Winter Soldier will connect to Black Widow, Loki will lead into MoM and Ms. Marvel will connect to Captain Marvel

But they'll all have crossover characters and linked storylines, you don't have to, but you should"
3897,2020-12-06 11:15:39,k77lqo,"Unlikely, source and I'll add it"
3898,2020-12-06 11:19:15,k77lqo,"Chances are, all those UMM will go to the TBDs, everything above is likely all we'll see, for Phase 4 at least


And it's a Marvel assigned thing"
3899,2020-12-06 14:29:25,k77lqo,Yep but it was the last movie of Phase 3
3900,2020-12-12 04:02:20,k77lqo,"If there is one character where you can get away with flipping the middle finger to continuity it’s Deadpool. I fully expect him to show up in Deadpool 3, meet some superheroes and tell them it’s ok if they don’t know who he is because his previous two movies were in a different universe."

Also they're planning to keep it R-Rated by all accounts"
3902,2020-12-06 20:14:41,k77lqo,"Feige reportedly said that Loki will lead into MoM, so changes are Wanda and Strange's exploration of the Multiverse will bring Loki, and if rumours are to be believed, Mjolnir back into the present day in time for Love & Thunder"
3903,2020-12-07 07:35:01,k77lqo,"Turns out I might have got ahead of myself with that one, if it's in keeping with the other shows it'll probably only have 6"
3904,2020-12-09 07:17:46,k77lqo,"Unfortunately neither of these things are confirmed. Hailee Steinfeld has been photographed countless times on Hawkeye, whist Kathryn Hahn's role is still speculation"

3920,2020-12-06 04:43:15,k77lqo,Bruh. Its literally directly leading to probably the biggest project of phase 4

I’m allowed to have a different opinion, fuck off."
3922,2020-12-05 17:18:33,k77lqo,"Up to you mate, you can DM me if you like and I'll add it behind a spoiler tag"

3924,2020-12-05 16:51:18,k77lqo,2026 is kind of a stretch.

Much like the character himself, the plot of the show is relatively unknown, however it is confirmed to be an origin story, due to the fact that the character isn't widely known.

Oscar Isaac has been tapped to play the multiple personalitied character, with no other casting known"

3963,2020-12-06 07:46:43,k77lqo,It’s ironic how I think Chris Evans made a great Human Torch and an iconic Captain America.
3964,2020-12-06 11:36:24,k77lqo,It was above all else fun and entertaining. Was it a cinematic masterpiece? No. But damn if I didn't enjoy the hell out of it.
3965,2020-12-06 07:11:24,k77lqo,I don't quite understand how either of those make sense to cast. Neither seem like they could fit the roles they're getting.
3966,2020-12-06 07:49:50,k77lqo,A lot of the guys who've already done franchise roles don't wanna come back for another multi-picture commitment; they're happy with a one-&-done.
3967,2020-12-05 15:11:38,k77lqo,"I believe that’s her name in the closed captions for the trailer, whether or not that means she’s “Agatha Harkness” is still speculation."

3972,2020-12-05 16:09:35,k77lqo,Plus probably trailers for Dr Strange and Spider-Man and others :(
3973,2020-12-06 03:12:00,k77lqo,Agreed. Can you imagine if covid hit right before End Game?
3974,2020-12-06 07:47:08,k77lqo,We're not getting 6 films in 2022.
3975,2020-12-05 21:59:05,k77lqo,I think they used Mulan as a test run and it didnt do well enough to do the same for Widow. Warner bros has to do it because they’re running out of money wheras Disney can probably sbsit off their savings for years.
3976,2020-12-06 00:18:45,k77lqo,"There are a few independent channels on youtube who talk about exactly that. The general consensus is that they would only make a fraction of the money by putting it on vod directly.

Imagine this: you want to watch the movie with your friends, it's in cinemas - you *all* buy a ticket. But if it's on vod, one person pays for it and the whole group can watch. Also there are a lot of people who watch movies a second or third time, so they buy a second or third movie ticket. But if you rented it on vod, you can watch it as often as you want within 48 hours and pay only once.

There's also other more profound reasons I think, but I just remembered the ones who are most relatable to myself"
3977,2020-12-05 20:41:35,k77lqo,"Methinks the team of Sam and Bucky will be “Captain America” - CA is no longer a single person, but an ideal to strive towards"
3978,2020-12-06 01:44:34,k77lqo,There was no rumour about passing the mantle between Bucky and Sam. In fact it's moře about dealing with Walker and Sam be coming Cap. Bucky has nothing to do with that since He has to reclaim his identity and deal with his past. Endgame was pretty clear of who will be Cap but we need to see it.
3979,2020-12-05 19:14:09,k77lqo,Just like the original Avengers.
3980,2020-12-05 16:55:28,k77lqo,Thanks for the effort have a nice day. Maybe eat something nice
3981,2020-12-05 18:26:01,k77lqo,"""Wow"""
3982,2020-12-06 05:21:02,k77lqo,"I thought you meant D'Arcy Carden from The Good Place, and I got excited. Then I went back up to look and I realized you meant Kat Denning's character from Thor."
3983,2020-12-05 17:01:31,k77lqo,I’m confused by this as the initial post says without click bait or rumours but when reading the post I came across several times you stating it’s a rumour
3984,2020-12-05 17:15:59,k77lqo,Idk why you would put that in and not Tobey/Andrew returning in Spider-Man. Both are equally unsubstantiated.
3985,2020-12-05 17:39:19,k77lqo,"“Without the clickbait, ads or rumours” he said and the Wandavision part begins with a consensus guess about the plot and the last paragraph is a rumour. Liar."

3987,2020-12-05 17:41:46,k77lqo,When did they confirm they wasn’t recasting T’Challa?
3988,2020-12-05 18:02:37,k77lqo,Apparently they never had a script ready pre-his passing
3989,2020-12-05 16:40:07,k77lqo,"Also, you wrote a group of ""Celestials"" instead of Eternals, Celestials are their creators."

3991,2020-12-05 16:23:55,k77lqo,Dang.  Dog's name is Pal but I have no clue where I caught that...  :(
3992,2020-12-05 15:38:13,k77lqo,Ah ok. Then yea it is likely going to be the first phase 4 movie set in 2023.
3993,2020-12-05 17:26:33,k77lqo,"You might be correct but the point would still stand that it would be the first movie set in the ""modern day"" of being post Endgame.

But also, it is possible that Endgame could have taken place in early 2023 and the events of Far From Home still took place in 2023. I don't remember if they say what time of the year it was."
3994,2020-12-05 17:32:36,k77lqo,I just looked it up and I think you might be right. The events of Endgame seems to end in the fall of 2023.
3995,2020-12-06 03:46:02,k77lqo,"Its very possible that the film will show a few different point in time (since intro films typically show the hero growing up or something similar) but I think the bulk of the film takes place post Tony's snap.
 Although I won't be upset if they have it take place during that 5 year skip."

There is nothing for Blade. There’s been no movement on that project so far aside from Mahershala Ali’s casting and the official logo. No director, no writer, no release windows, nothing.

Safe to say Blade will be a 2023 release."
3998,2020-12-06 07:55:12,k77lqo,I don't think they ever announced a date for Blade at all; people just assumed 2022 because it was the first year with open dates.
3999,2020-12-05 18:34:45,k77lqo,"Evan Peters played Quicksilver in Sony's X-Men franchise. Frankly he was pretty amazing at it, and he was far stronger than MCU's limp-dicked Quicksilver. They're speculating that because he's in Wandavision, he's playing an alternate version of her brother. 

Seems doubtful, since Sony's Marvel properties don't mix with the MCU."

4007,2020-12-05 15:37:27,k77lqo,"Some very solid casting choices here. Zenobia was great in The Big Sick, and Laith is excellent in Ramy. However, he's playing a character who couldn't be more unlike Uncle Naseem and I think that's awesome."
4008,2020-12-05 15:38:03,k77lqo,"She’s pretty well liked as far as I can tell. I think she’s pretty neat, at least."
4009,2020-12-05 23:47:23,k77lqo,shes represting the muslim demographic since her creator is from new jersey and the writer is a muslim as well they go in depth about it on the new marvel 616 documentary series. very informative and cool.
4010,2020-12-05 16:16:28,k77lqo,Stretchy yes but more importantly she’s a polymorph
4011,2020-12-05 20:03:10,k77lqo,Yeah baby. I’m good
4012,2020-12-05 19:03:11,k77lqo,Rather complicated. Long story short: market saturation and market homogenization
4013,2020-12-06 12:04:46,k77lqo,But she was born in 1984 in the mcu.
4014,2020-12-05 18:14:34,k77lqo,Also everyone remember GOTG3 was supposed to have a 2020 release.  We were never supposed to be teased about “Adam” for this long.

4023,2020-12-05 19:19:48,k77lqo,"My favorite suggestion I've heard so far, if Wright were to be removed from the series, was to set the story in 2023-2024, reveal that the character of Shuri was never snapped by Thanos as originally believed, age her up to adulthood (and recast her), and introduce the new version of her as BP after opening the movie with a funeral ceremony for King T'Challa."
4024,2020-12-05 18:47:14,k77lqo,I’m like 90% certain Lord Feige said Deadpool 3 would be R.

4026,2020-12-05 17:13:00,k77lqo,"No kidding. That’s too bad, I like her in everything I see her in and would’ve loved to see more of her. Either way, it’s literally impossible for me to be any more excited than I am for Hawkeye. I want more Ronin so badly."

4028,2020-12-05 20:46:10,k77lqo,Thanks. I've read about him before just don't remember the details. Just seems like him and Christian Bale would make a really cool combo.
4029,2020-12-06 08:09:39,k77lqo,What one? Am I forgetting something?
4030,2020-12-05 19:31:34,k77lqo,"That's not how canon works.

It's non-canonical unless we hear otherwise. 

We haven't had any mention of it being in the multiverse."
4031,2020-12-06 03:13:55,k77lqo,"Fair enough, though I don't think the Blade source is very reliable."
4032,2020-12-05 19:57:03,k77lqo,"As for Erin, the picture was deleted, but a dozen posts can be found about it, like [this one](https://thedirect.com/article/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-first-look-at-erin-kellymans-mystery-character-revealed). As for Hawkeye's family, they're [here](https://twitter.com/JRennerNet/status/1334970951814049792?s=20), and I also forgot about Echo in Hawkeye, played by [Alaqua Cox](https://www.murphysmultiverse.com/exclusive-first-look-at-alaqua-cox-as-echo-in-hawkeye/)"

4034,2020-12-05 22:51:38,k77lqo,"Ya. For phase 3 I was pumped for everything. Even after many of my friends had stopped caring about the movies.

But now I guess things have changed. I can imagine not having time to watch everything and all the other things I want to do/watch. So I guess I'm just expecting to not be able to enjoy marvel stuff as much as I used to and will have to really prioritize things."
4035,2020-12-05 23:06:49,k77lqo,"> When Waititi was doing press for Thor: Ragnarok, he told Screen Rant that he'd want to make Thor: Ragnarok 2, not Thor 4. If he and Marvel envision Ragnarok as a soft reboot and start of a new trilogy, then Thor 5 is where Waititi and Hemsworth could bring the character's story to a close.

This doesn't say there is any evidence there will be a trilogy. It's just speculation based on the idea that if Love and Thunder is ""Thor: Ragnarok 2"", there must be a ""Thor: Ragnarok 3"""
4036,2020-12-06 01:45:54,k77lqo,"Oh, alright. Thanks!"
4037,2020-12-06 12:00:45,k77lqo,Feige never said TFATWS is connected to BW. That is made out of the fact Ross appear most likely in both and his nickame is Thunderbolt. They might forming a team.
4038,2020-12-06 11:58:39,k77lqo,TBDs? To be determined? And yeah I guess anything beyond 2022 will be considered Phase 5.
4039,2020-12-06 14:54:07,k77lqo,"Ohhhh alright, I mean Shang-Chi might be during the five year gap, not that its official but it is more likely."
4040,2020-12-06 21:26:21,k77lqo,"I more meant adopting a film series that isn't part of their continuity and continuing it rather than the use of numbers in their titles. Calling it Deadpool 3 very much links it to the previous deadpool films which were made by a different studio. I assumed it would be a bit of a soft reboot.

Sorry I wasn't clear enough. Obviously I'm aware of the already existing MCU films with numbers in the title, but cheers."
4041,2020-12-09 17:46:36,k77lqo,Aha! I must’ve missed that. I’m not an idiot I swear

4057,2020-12-05 18:09:00,k77lqo,It’s a good idea because getting a director and a script are major parts of pre-production.  Sam Raimi also has the Sony Spider-Man connection which is very worth noting.

The article you linked me, which only links to the original Deadline article as a source, says (as I said earlier) only that “he’ll appear in the film” without proof, without some other source confirming it, honestly making it look more like a mistake or misunderstanding that everyone’s running with.

Anyways maybe it's a hot take but I prefer to wait a few months so I can watch it in theaters"
4082,2020-12-06 03:52:21,k77lqo,"One thing great about seeing a movie in theatres is you cannot pause it and you cannot delay it to take your mind out of it for a phone call or to look at your phone during a pause. It is a full experience that you cannot really control.

You cannot rewind the film and rewatch an action scene real quick to catch all the detail - it is just in your face full ride, no pause, just go. This makes me experience a movie better in theatres and pay close attention because there is no doover except going back to the theatre to watch again (which I do with movies full of details and thrills).

A movie theatre experience is so much better for me just for that reason, let alone hearing gasps when insane things happen like Thanos ripping off the surface of a moon for a final fantasy ""meteo"" attack!!!"

4091,2020-12-05 18:10:25,k77lqo,"They had a director and that’s it.  There was no news of a script.

As for recasting, who knows.  Marvel confirmed they will not CGI Boseman a la Paul Walker."

Trailers that spoils all the plot points are a lot more disappointing than just reading on rumors."

As soon as I read the that one shows information in this post I knew this wasn’t going to be about the facts. I just wanted to know the real things going to happen in the mcu like your title implied. Still a liar.

Edit: this post has mildly infuriated me because the title literally clickbaited me into reading a whole youtube news/tabloid style karma whore liar written post/article 

its full of the shit that wasn’t supposed to be here a glass half empty and filled with no substance

4149,2020-12-05 16:05:45,k77lqo,i mean the source under it is Murphy's Multiverse
4150,2020-12-06 07:59:05,k77lqo,"Indeed, Miles was so well-received that he & his supporting cast were the only characters to survive the end of the Ultimate Marvel comics & get transferred into 616 continuity, and Kamala at one point set records for online & trade-paperback sales (a lot of the neckbeards only care about monthly floppy sales, though)."
4151,2020-12-06 13:43:16,k77lqo,You never know but Markus and McFeely said she's not 90 years old like in the comics and Feige mentioned Natasha is not enhanced like in the comics. Her story works well without that element.

I worked with a spoiler scooper who has a good track record, I was verified by the moderators in the marvel spoiler sub, and had multiple scoops from my source inside the Disney plus shows. I’ve been saying who he’s playing since it was leaked he was in the show.

Going straight to Spider-Verse feels lame with zero set up. As weird as it feels to be rooting against such an amazing concept, I hope the extent of Tobey and Garfield’s involvement is just a tease for a fully fleshed out Spider-Verse movie later."

Also Ryan Reynolds is a speculation/theory by fans"
4185,2020-12-07 03:18:28,k77lqo,I didn’t know Blade was set for 2022. I thought it would release in 2023 or 2024 as a part of Phase 5.
4186,2020-12-05 23:56:56,k77lqo,"Problem with that is, Marvel might be a lot more cautious to wanna set up a 4th film given there’s no guarantee they’ll even get to do one. It’s *extremely* possible that the current contract between Disney and Sony may not get renewed again."

4191,2020-12-05 18:54:39,k77lqo,They were very angry it got out earlier this year so I would say we won’t hear anything until the show airs. They viewed it akin to baby yoda reveal and wanted it a surprise.
4192,2020-12-05 16:29:31,k77lqo,I'll add it as a rumour!
4193,2020-12-06 00:01:59,k77lqo,"Oh I assumed that the spider verse push came from Sony rather than Feige. Because Feige seemed to be setting up the Sinister Six, although I guess the Sinister Six could work as Spider-Verse villains."
4194,2020-12-06 13:26:12,k77lqo,">“No. There’s only one Chadwick, and he’s no longer with us. Sadly, our king has died in real life, not only in fiction, and we’re taking a little time to see how we continue the story and how to honor this chapter of what has unexpectedly happened to us, so painful and terrible to be honest,” Alonso said. “Chadwick wasn’t only a wonderful human being, every day of the 5 years we spent together, but also, I believe, that what he did as a character elevated us as a company, and has left his moment on history.”

Just because you don't believe me doesn't mean you have to insult me mate"
4195,2020-12-05 17:39:22,k77lqo,Yea its insane. But maybe by getting so far ahead they will able to be less concerned about the strictness of the time-line going forward?
4196,2020-12-05 17:11:36,k77lqo,Do you have a link for that Quicksilver scoop?
4197,2020-12-05 16:49:11,k77lqo,"Hi, did you put characters too? Because Clea and Brother Voodoo are supposed to appear in Doctor Strange 2. We just haven't found out about the casting yet."
4198,2020-12-06 00:04:27,k77lqo,"To be honest, it could go either way. But regardless, I’d think Feige would be very reticent about designing a movie with set-up for a direct sequel in that fashion given the nebulous possibility of a sequel he has control over. Sort of like an “if you’re gonna do spider-verse, I’m going to make sure it’s done right!” Sort of thing.
Edit: also yeah, I get the feeling they might be doing a Sinister Six deal plus Spider-verse deal. But we’ll see how it all plays out. I have faith in the writers, though!"
4199,2020-12-06 13:32:25,k77lqo,"Yeah, I read that full message, nowhere it's written that we are not considering any recasting, because this message clearly not stating at any point that they completely denying a recast and that's it's off the table...they clearly said they're taking a little time to figure out how to continue...

Also, Sorry, if it come off as rude, English isn't my first language, It didn't meant that to be rude tbh, if words came out like that, I'm sorry, bud...I always believe in a healthy discussion/conversation..."
4200,2020-12-05 17:40:34,k77lqo,"Personally I like and prefer the MCU being “present day.” I know their world is vastly different than ours especially after Endgame, but it always felt like a believable representation of how alien invasions and super powered people would be reacted to IRL"
4201,2020-12-05 18:55:06,k77lqo,I don’t but it was on Murphy’s site earlier this year I believe

4203,2020-12-05 22:42:38,k77lqo,I'll not add them until someone is cast in their role!
4204,2020-12-06 14:04:35,k77lqo,"""Our King has died, not _only_ in fiction"", meaning he's died in real life and in the fictional universe

Also, what the hell is with the plot imitating Avatar? And don't come up with me with this ""asian influences"", I don't remember any famous old asian legend about unifying tribes, at least not one which don't involves the protagonist kills lots of people because he is a conqueror."

4216,2020-11-23 19:16:07,jzmrwk,"Trust me, there are many Asians in the creative arts spaces. The Kpop industry for example is far far bigger than just BTS, although BTS is a shining example.

The problem isn't that there aren't any Asians who pursue acting, singing, etc. The problem is more that these individuals just don't get highlighted in Western media. It's no coincidence that many of the most prominent Asian artists are not based in the Anglosphere."
4217,2020-11-24 01:43:35,jzmrwk,"There are tons of Asians in the arts, it's just that opportunities are denied to us at the highest level. That's why talented Asian-American musicians go to Korea to make it in the kpop industry, rather than stay here, for example. They don't get the same opportunity here.

https://www.koreaboo.com/lists/20-kpop-idols-born-in-america-might-surprise/

Juilliard is 14% Asian, larger than both the African-American and Hispanic/Latino demographics. And yet somehow Hollywood and the music industry doesn't reflect anything close to that.

In visual arts there are tons of extremely talented artists. Check out Art Center in Pasadena, a very prestigious art school, over 35% Asian. Don't buy that ""Asians are just good at math and aren't creative"" BS. The problem isn't talent, or effort, or skill, or cultivation, it's the lack of opportunities, denied to us by the bamboo ceiling."
4218,2020-11-23 18:10:55,jzmrwk,"There are, they are all being stuck at purgatory because the industry is selective in choosing what is acceptable, and Asians aren't acceptable. Only white men are acceptable. It took Hollywood or Oscars not being diverse by black people protest to move this cinderblock barely. Asians in America had to go to Asia to become mega famous to just get a chance in America. The Anglosphere is the lowest you can go for Asians, places like Dijibouti and Guyana don't have the same restrictions as Australia, Canada, and the US do. Your race holds you back big time, but don't worry. The Anglosphere and its audiences are all a piece of giant turd. No need to appeal to them, there are more people living outside of it, plus immigrants living in it that don't prescribe to their racial hierarchy. You can appeal to the world, why focus on some small minded hick of people living in small towns."
4219,2020-11-23 20:47:56,jzmrwk,Gatekeeping from those in the industry and simply our parents pushing us for more stable slave corporate jobs
4220,2020-11-23 20:38:56,jzmrwk,"There have been several notable 1/2 and 1/4 Asians in the metal/rock scene. Mike Inez the bass player from Alice In Chains is half Filipino, Kirk Hammett the guitar player from Metallica is half Filipino, Eddie Van Halen RIP is 1/4 Indonesian. However the only full Asian I am aware of was from the lead singer Sothira Pheng  of Crucifix bay area punk band from the 80's who were pretty big domestic and abroad however their genre of punk wasn't . Sothira arrived in the bay area as a refugee from the Killing Fields of  Cambodia and somehow joined this insane punk rock band."
4221,2020-11-23 21:55:46,jzmrwk,"Racism doesn’t just play “some sort of role”, it’s pretty much the main reason there’s so few Asian guys in cool roles and the majority of famous Asians are either Asian women that always play the love interest of a black or white guy and Ken Jeongs/Matt Moys/Jimmy Yangs.  It’s not just the media creators either.  Sometimes they try to put Asian men in a good role but the public will reject it."
4222,2020-11-23 22:43:17,jzmrwk,"When you say entertainment industry I'm not sure if you're only referring to roles that the public sees like acting, or also including the folks that work in creative fields that's less visible. I'm in the animation industry and I can tell you there're a lot of asians."
4223,2020-11-24 02:32:49,jzmrwk,"Clearly it's an industry that is filtering out Asians and stifling their growth. This is apparent when you see how asian women are vastly better represented in that industry than asian men. Asian women and asian men grew up under a similar cultural background, the blame therefore cannot be placed on the cultural side. Anecdotal evidence that has been posted on extensively here corroborates this fully, where major studios are infested with casting directors and others who have deep-seated biases towards how asians should be portrayed. Our poor representation is a direct product of that, and nothing else.

If you go into that industry, always speak out for what's right. One of the most pressing issues is the horrible way they have treated asian men and there is a clear history of that that is well documented in this subreddit. It's much worse than I thought, and one of the least understood and appreciated problems facing our asian-american community today."
4224,2020-11-24 03:20:32,jzmrwk,"it’s because media is not as viable a profession for asians- it’s worse than not having white privileged, we have negative privilege (unless you’re an AF - eg every news channel has at least one AF anchor). 

The moment there’s a sense that the odds are not ridiculously against us, there will be more of us pursuing the arts.

That’s why I always think of any AM who pursues the arts in this hostile climate has major balls (unless you look like a stereotype, then you’re hired)"
4225,2020-11-26 06:44:39,jzmrwk,"Yup. White privilege and racism exists. Even the more ""liberal"" whites see Asians as perpetual foreigners so they are uncomfortable with representing too many Asians in western entertainment industry/art."
4226,2020-11-24 01:55:44,jzmrwk,Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park/Fort Minor is amwf. I'm sure you know of him?
4227,2020-11-24 13:56:29,jzmrwk,"Yes I know of him and the band however he was the dj/back up vocals so I don't think he was as popular that the front man Chester Bennington RIP,  the Fort Minor project I might have heard about it back in the day but never gave it a listen."

4260,2020-12-18 06:03:11,kfecf8,"The people who browse Asian country subs on reddit fit into a certain demographic called loser back home. They couldn't get a job and couldn't get laid back where they were both so they move to Asia seeking to exploit their skin colour to get some shitty dead end ESL job and to get their dick wet. They have a superiority complex, a massive ego, and are racist due to the culture they were raised in. They basically believe all your white stereotypes of Asians. They also view Asian men as competition for women so they spend all day slandering Asian men online. They refuse to integrate with the local culture so there ends up being a culture clash so they just end up being degenerates seething all day and venting in their own shitholes and hanging in their own toxic wmaf cliques instead of interacting with the locals."
