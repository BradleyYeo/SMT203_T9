Tijuana Bibles are actually not old in the grand scheme of things. The Victorians had vast quantities of pornography, a lot of Elizabethan erotica has survived, etc. We'd probably have a lot more porn from antiquity if the monks hadn't tossed so much of it and mostly copied the respectable stuff, but even then some of the things they doodled in the margins was a bit naughty."

37,2020-02-10 11:55:01,ez0aa2,That's exactly the problem I want to solve. As so as spoiled men can't see how their privilege takes from us. Any constructive idea?

2. Stop talking about women like they're all weak and helpless victims of society

I'm unsure of what exactly your goal is. My prior comment was pointing out that the blog idea you posted is actually a very common theme, but it is one that many people view as a joke because it tends to devolves into ""I'm a woman, you're a man, and I'm very angry about this 24/7"""
39,2020-02-10 13:52:46,ez0aa2,"Nop. Not in my opinion. We both are human and we were raised like shit. Raised like if our genitals is what makes us human is source of all that hatred.

Anyway, I want the blog to address men and women who still don't get feminism isn't for one or other gender to dominate the other .. but for each individual's to be allow to speak from himself. 

We both need to step back on the bullshit we believe. 

I mentioned my sex life because I think my tips could help men who don't want to sound disrespectful when they like a girl, men who don't understand what in the behaviour is not ok anymore.

 girls who still can't stand for themselves, girls who still think we can guess their feeling without them talking,


Our enemy isn't a pussy or a dick but fear. Fear of being rejected by the other gender, fear of losing ourselves. 

Any name idea :p"
40,2020-02-10 14:38:27,ez0aa2,"A blog by a woman that is informing men on how to approach women without being afraid of offending anyone sounds like a good idea, I haven't seen that kind of thing. I like the last paragraph about fear being the enemy. 

I don't know what the culture is like where you're from, so the rest may be more relevant than it seems to me. But speaking from the perspective of an American man, framing anything around feminism is likely to make it difficult for you to get your point across because it's such a charged topic here. Some see it as true equality, but others see it as a joke because of the way many over here choose to go about it, regardless of their gender. Male feminists are even more joked about. There's a big stigma you have to overcome if your audience has a lot of Americans. 

The way you talked about women and men just sounded a lot like the majority of feminist blogs already do. Instead of focusing so heavily on what's wrong and needs fixed, I think they could be focusing more on promoting the beliefs and opinions they believe to be positive, encouraging women and men to be leaders and spread their positive views from the top.

Yes Oprah may have made a decision that made her career not go the way she intended but she also has to realize she may be part of the problem. Constantly berating someone you used to work with makes others weary of working and associating with you. 

I look at it this way. If she worked in another industry and had a less than pleasant experience with an employer, she's well within her right to make a complaint to the accreditation association or governing board but beyond that it becomes irksome and annoying to constantly blame someone else for your problems.

If she took all of that energy she puts into bad mouthing Oprah, people might give her chance. Meanwhile Oprah is graciously not saying anything and minding her business."

Harvey Weinstein's sexual allegations date back to the 1970s and he was accused before Simmons.

No, its always time. I'm not arguing against that point. Stop inserting false narratives. 

>Please explain how white men's bad behavior means black men's should go unchecked by the community?

I never argued against that point. My argument, Monique's argument. 50 cent argument etc. is that Oprah isn't keeping that same energy when it comes to white men. A powerful white man has put a gag on Oprah. Now she refuses to talk bad about any white man and his sexual assault allegations. The disparities couldn't be any clearer. It's obvious she doesn't want to get blackballed from white/Jewish Hollywood for assisting in bringing down powerful white men."
68,2020-02-05 16:46:25,eywvnx,"Ok so let's say you and Monique are right. 

So, she shouldn't do anything about black molesters? And it's also her responsibility to call out poorly behaving white men? And it's her own fault she doesn't have enough power to fight white patriarchy? And the best place for you (as I believe, a black man) to fight this injustice is to argue on a black women's forum that a powerful black woman is being questionable in her dealing with black men?"

Again, stop inserting false narratives. I'm never said she shouldn't and I'm not arguing against that point. 

>And it's her own fault she doesn't have enough power to fight white patriarchy?

So, you're condoning Oprahs behavior?

>And the best place for you (as I believe, a black man) to fight this injustice is to argue on a black women's forum that a powerful black woman is being questionable in her dealing with black men?

You just won't stop inserting false narratives and its disgusting. If Oprah isn't keeping that same energy when white men assault black women, who's really the opposition here? Oprah's now saying that its rainbow clouds and silver linings when a white man sexually assaults black women and men. Me, Monique, & 50 cent etc. want Oprah to hold white men to the same standard and not give them a pass. It's disingenuous for Oprah to fight injustice only when it benefits her and she doesn't lose. Most reasonable people will agree with us. 

Oh yea, Now you're making a last-ditch effort to argue that black men shouldn't even be here. I've done nothing but try to discuss this topic logically and reasonably with you. Like I've done with plenty of black women in r/blackfellas on various topics that are sensitive in the black community. So, dont do that. If we as opposite genders can't enter each other's spaces respectfully and have a logical and fact-based discussion then we're further behind as a community than I thought."
70,2020-02-05 18:55:52,eywvnx,"As far as Oprah and these three men, yes I condone it. I don't see why black women need to consider racial quotas when we call out sexual predators. You still haven't presented a good argument for why we should. 

You actually aren't having this conversation with respect for the women in this space. Your whole idea that black women should not call out black men who harm us without directing our efforts to white men is damaging to the community at large as it holds us back from tackling the very real issue of sexual violence within our community, and also, it's illogical bullshit."
71,2020-02-06 00:47:22,eywvnx,">As far as Oprah and these three men, yes I condone it.

Well, at least you finally admitted it. 

> don't see why black women need to consider racial quotas when we call out sexual predators. You still haven't presented a good argument for why we should.

I never said anything about racial quotas. You keep forming these new narratives in your head, you project them on to me and then present arguments against them. I'll tell you once again. 

Me, Monique and 50 cent argument etc. want Oprah to keep that same energy when it comes to white men. You already admitted that she isn't doing that and you're fine with that, but WE aren't. We want every man held to the same standard and scrutinized and jailed if he decided to sexually assault a black woman. If powerful white men see that there's no punishment for assaulting black women then he'll be incentivized to do it. 

>Your whole idea that black women should not call out black men who harm us without directing our efforts to white men is damaging to the community at large as it holds us back from tackling the very real issue of sexual violence within our community, and also, it's illogical bullshit.

You're the queen of inserting false narratives. I'll just have to keep repeating this to you. I want a ALL powerful men jailed if they sexually assault a black woman. I'm not here advocating for Russell Simmons or MJ to get a pass. I'm here advocating for Oprah to not ignore the other races of men who are assaulting black women. Oprah's now saying that its rainbow clouds and silver linings when a white man sexually assaults black women and men. Me, Monique, & 50 cent etc. want Oprah to hold white men to the same standard and not give them a pass. It's disingenuous for Oprah to fight injustice only when it benefits her and she doesn't lose.

89,2020-02-03 14:01:42,ey7621,I'd prefer Oprah just go away.
90,2020-02-03 14:37:55,ey7621,Such a good point!
91,2020-02-03 17:47:56,ey7621,"You can't sell your brand as keto, nothing to make money on. She's 100% making millions from whatever shill ""buy this that and this"" she's on."
92,2020-02-03 14:08:25,ey7621,Naw she can stay with weight watchers that really doesn’t work.... I did we for years would lose weight and gain it back
93,2020-02-03 14:06:37,ey7621,"I understand that, but I was also talking about keeping the weight off long term. Lots of people wind up gaining all the weight back while doing these weight loss programs. And of course it’ll work for some people, but it’s extremely hard to constantly eat food like that and not overdo it"
94,2020-02-03 13:43:00,ey7621,There's lots of people selling bullshit keto supplements. You'd think Oprah would want to get in on that scam too.
95,2020-02-03 13:34:59,ey7621,"That’s why I said it’s great marketing, I’m just saying her diet’s are bs"
96,2020-02-03 13:43:20,ey7621,"And you can really tell by the amount of weight she’s lost, good for her!"
97,2020-02-03 14:56:19,ey7621,How did you gain it back?
98,2020-02-03 14:11:29,ey7621,"Most diets are really hard to sustain long term because it largely hinges on personal willpower. Yes that would be harder because the nature of what you’d be eating makes it easier to slip, but it’s a possibility nevertheless."
99,2020-02-03 14:59:19,ey7621,By not following and tracking food weight watchers is great if you wanna stay on it forever and pay... keto and omad work wonders no tracking no diet
100,2020-02-03 15:31:40,ey7621,"Willpower is largely bullcrap. 

Your hormones and gut microbiome are in control of your eating.

Hormones/gut balanced, ""willpower"" is cranked up to 11.

Hormones/gut messed up, willpower gone. Nothing you can really do about it."
101,2020-02-03 15:03:00,ey7621,"At the end of the day it’s still just managing calorie intake and eating at a deficit or maintenance depending on your goal. It’s great that you found a more sustainable way for you, but that doesn’t invalidate the fact that basic calorie tracking also works."
102,2020-02-03 15:32:37,ey7621,How do you keep your gut balanced?
103,2020-02-03 15:04:31,ey7621,Tracking works to a point not the nest way to manage and stay healthy my point is put the tracker away put the scale away and practice self love... no diet no way of eating can make you happy... weight watchers is not sustainable or healthy for the long run
104,2020-02-03 16:25:36,ey7621,"Whooo boy....that's the million dollar question isn't it?

To keep it simple, cutting out most sugars makes a huge difference. 

This alone will help stabilize your insulin and leptin hormones, and removes the food supply for most of the bad bacteria that can overtake your microbiome.

&#x200B;

From there, it gets more complicated. Sleep, stress, environment, even the soap you use can affect your microbiome. Remember antibacterial soap? Yeah it was banned because it killed good bacteria and left bad bacteria to multiply unchecked. 

&#x200B;

How can I tell my hormones and gut are doing better? First off, willpower ain't a thing for me anymore. It's almost like emotional attachment to food is gone - that is NOT through any magical ""willpower"" effort on my part. It just happened. Many people on here have made comments about food no longer having any hold on them anymore. The changes started happening within days of changing my eating habits. This is because my gut microbiome was changing. Cravings changed from sweets to veggies quite quickly.

&#x200B;

The other way I can tell is...my poop. I've been keto/IF for 8 months. I'm pooping the best poops of my life right now. Lol! For a few months it was rough going. Now things have stabilized.

&#x200B;

I highly recommend you dig more into the current gut microbiome research happening today."
105,2020-02-03 15:10:01,ey7621,"Pretty bold to suggest that someone logging their foods in an app and tracking calories isn’t practicing self love. 

Weight Watchers as a program isn’t sustainable long term but really only due to the cost and business model, but the basic tenets of it are absolutely fine and sustainable for losing and keeping off the weight. It’s about willpower and what works for that individual."
106,2020-02-03 16:27:30,ey7621,So to get your gut microbiome right you have to make changes to your diet and lifestyle first? Does that not take willpower?
107,2020-02-03 20:36:30,ey7621,"Suspected troll...but responded hoping for the best. 

Suspicions check out."
108,2020-02-03 20:42:10,ey7621,"I’m not trolling, I lost 40 lbs on keto, slipped up last year and am back on it now, I think it’s great and it works for me. I just think it’s ridiculous to say willpower is bullcrap. There is 100% a mental aspect to starting and sticking with any diet. Yes once you make and commit to those changes, it has a very positive impact on things like cravings, but you need the mental fortitude to get there in the first place. Do you not?"

No one was paying attention in the crossroads of New York as I was giving my speech.

""M-m-mine...""

However, one person was intrigued in what I was saying.

""M-m-m-minecraft...""

Then it was just a domino effect, ten more people are watching.

""Minecraft...""

A hundred were now watching, this had caught the attention of even the busy drivers in rush hour. Their faces in anticipation, some were even scared. Others were complaining that this isn't the real deal.

""MINECRAFT...""

But they all suddenly started cheering, shaking, praying. When they heard my tone, my pitch, my timbre.... they all knew what was going to come next. They realized... that salvation of the human race has finally come.

""Minecraft good Fortnite bad""

And then the silence broke

""OOOIOIIUUUUUGHHHhJJHHHHHWAASEAAAa//::""

Thousands of people fell to their knees, yelling orgasmically. People starting crying tears of joy, others were running and thanking God, News reporters were already on the scene, broadcasting the entire thing nationwide and consequently the entire world. Hundreds of people came out of their cars, buses, taxis, stores, and subway stations hooting and hollering. It was a miracle unfolding.

I started to say the next sentence relayed to me by our Lord and Savior.

""M-m-mi... Mine...""

Already some people fainted at just the mere sound of my voice. Even more people came. Some were jumping from planes thousands of feet in the air, others ran or swam miles to here in mere seconds. I think I even spotted a few famous people.

""MINE...""

Nearly a million people were here now. There's now Europeans, Canadians, Mexicans, Latin Americans, West Coasters, Africans, and even several Asians and one Australian. They were screaming hysterically, bringing gifts for me, taking pictures and videos. Fireworks and confetti everywhere, helicopters, and even Donald Trump was here with his family bowing down to me.

""MINEC-C-C-CRAFT *voice crack*""

A billion people were here now. Even animals from all over the world were coming in herds. I could see Pewdiepie &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Martiza, Elon Musk, Keanu Reeves, Lil Nas X, 50 Cent, Oprah Winfrey, the Kardashians, and so many other people. Many people were having seizures, heart attacks, and strokes from the sheer excitement, and some were being trampled to death because of the huge crowd. The screaming was deafening. Some just came straight out of their bathroom, school, work, or their parenting... but it doesn't matter now.

""MMMMMMIIIIINNNNEEECRAAAFTTTTT""

No matter what was your race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, economic class, etc... it didn't matter. All of humanity has come together for this one moment. Millions of people have died to due plane crashes, car crashes, doctors abandoning their patients, parents abandoning their children... just to be here, but it will all be worth it.

Nearly half of humanity is here now. Even the dead came out their graves for this. Everyone is climbing on top of each other and on the walls of skyscrapers since they couldn't fit. So many lights, music, dancing, feasts... yet barely a minute passed. Humanity is very interesting.

10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

I look at the smiling faces of the crowd in front of me. I look at the death and destruction that came from sacrifice to attend this event. This is it. We're ready.

""Minecraft good Fortnite bad Instagram normie Emojis bad Keanu breathtaking Wholesome 100 [Everyone liked that] Area 51 PETA bad 69 nice 420""

Billions of people around the world disintegrated into their pure chemical compounds that composed their bodies, then their atoms, then their protons/neutrons/electrons, and finally their quarks... as they heard that holy sentence. The distant echoes of yelling can heard from thousands of miles. This... this was their ultimate purpose in life. This is the culmination of everything that has happened in human history, it is reason why life even existed in the first place. They weren't screaming in terror, they were shouting in orgasmic joy. They could finally die happy. Their entire lives flashed before their eyes as they saw their loved ones. They saw their ultimate fantasy. They can finally be freed from their imperfect bodies in this imperfect world. 

The Sun blinked out. The Moon crashed into the Earth. The Earth turned into dust. The Solar System collapsed into a state of entropy. The Milky Way hosts a firework show of supernovas. All the galaxies of the universe colliding with one another. Reality is falling apart. That's because reality doesn't need to exist anymore. It has reached its goal. Spacetime has fallen. Matter ceases to exist. Not even the concept of nothing exists. The universe was never born.

Humanity is gone. Everything is gone. We are now one. Evil doesn't exist anymore. Insecurities don't exist anymore.  Fear, sadness, anger don't exist anymore. Just hope, love, and harmony for eternity. This is what we were meant to be. This is our final evolution stage.

This is heaven. This is what it means to be happy.

Congratulations."

There is still a lot to learn and you’ll eventually get there and start speed running black tusk on heroic and even doing legendary. 
Every faction and unit has strengths and weaknesses, for example black tusk robotics (including drones) are very vulnerable to jammer (under pulse skill)
Also your demolisher firefly can destroy weak points making most of the skills unusable by the npc. 
Once you optimize your dps build you’ll be shredding. 
You need to learn to assess the various threats and take appropriate measures to counter them. It takes time and practice. 
Try to join a clan you’ll learn a lot of stuff. 

I’ll give you a very small yet useful tip: whenever you see incendiary or shock ammo, equip them on your secondary or side weapon and use then exclusively for crowd control or self defense ( like if an elite is rushing you) and only shoot once per enemy.

2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil

1/2 medium onion, finely chopped

1 small carrot or 1/2 large carrot, finely chopped

1 small stalk of celery, including the green tops, finely chopped

2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley

1 28 oz. can whole tomatoes, including the juice, or 1 3/4 pound of fresh tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped

1 teaspoon tomato paste

Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

METHOD

1 Gently cook the onion, carrot, celery, and parsley: Heat olive oil in a large wide skillet on medium heat. Add the chopped onion, carrot, celery and parsley. Stir to coat.

144,2020-03-27 22:34:52,fq754q,"Ask him what evidence he has. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

And these are very very serious claims indeed.

Once he is unable to give any evidence (not even ordinary evidence), just tell him ""no, it's not Oprah, it's Cthulhu"". And tell him you have the same amount of evidence for Cthulhu as he has for Oprah.

Case closed.

\_\_\_\_

EDIT: Feelings are not evidence. Beliefs are not evidence. ""Evidence"" is evidence. Ask him to show the evidence.

\_\_\_\_

EDIT 2: If all the above fails (my parents had similar conspiracy theories), just ask them ""What if it's the Russians that are actually spreading these ""evidence"" in order to destabilize the U.S.A.? (or whatever country or thing they believe in)"". That worked for me."
145,2020-03-27 22:55:45,fq754q,"Q's first post indicated that Hillary was in Gitmo. How'd that pan out? But Qult members excel at moving the goalposts, so they'll tell you that since Trump tweeted the word ""America"" at 1:58 on the 18th, that's all the proof anyone should need.

The claim that the arrests of celebrity pedophiles need to be hidden makes no sense, especially if Trump were the one taking them down. When has that man ever been quiet about anything?"
146,2020-03-27 23:20:44,fq754q,"I'd just bring up all the shit that ""Q"" has predicted that never happened."
147,2020-03-28 00:15:35,fq754q,"You’re right to think it’s like a cult. My mom’s involved with it too, it’s incredibly frustrating and disheartening. Q is literally just some random asshole on 8chan LARPing as some kind of high-level intelligence expert. Think about your dad being “knowledgeable” on the topic really means. All he’s doing is regurgitating bullshit, so of course he’s more familiar with that bullshit than you are.

From what I’ve read about people in these fucked up online cults, the only way you can maybe get through to them is by gently asking questions until they start seeing the contradictions for themselves. I’ve never tried this with my mom, as she shuts down the instant the topic is brought up, and I’ve decided it’s not worth my time or energy anymore.

There’s a lot of stuff online debunking specifics of the QAnon thing, but the wingnuts fling so much shit at the wall every day that it’s hard to keep up. It’s actually pretty funny how this conspiracy theory ties together almost every other prominent conspiracy theory ever, Pepe Silvia style. You’ve got the Rothschilds, the anti-Semitism, the NWO, the Clintons, the “Hollywood elite,” even fucking JFK Jr!"
148,2020-03-28 03:24:08,fq754q,"r/Qult_Headquarters is a good resource.

The biggest contradiction is that Q is still alive.  How many people really have access to the information he has?  He has provided pictures of his pen and watch online.  He has been leaking very specific information.  These are people supposedly smart enough to control the entire world, how could they have not caught him from the extremely narrow pool of people in question?

The other big contradiction is why he is providing this information.  If he has to provide so much ""disinformation"", what is the point of telling anyone anything when he is actively tipping off the people he is trying to catch what is about to happen to him?  And when people on the internet decode his communication, why are they posting it publicly for these villains to see?

The final issue is that someone has been caught on video with the QAnon account open, someone who most definitely does not have the access QAnon supposedly has."
149,2020-03-28 00:46:42,fq754q,"Ask him what the natural conclusion should be.
If Q is right and there’s a huge pedophile ring that’s in cahoots with the government and Hollywood, what’s the right thing to do?

Even at a basic level , the right thing is to not watch any or tv or movies. Listen to music? Nope. Can’t do that anymore.

Any good, moral person would dedicate their lives to stopping this shit, right? Can you imagine if you found out there was pedophile ring? I would die trying to stop that shit. Would your dad?

Basically, if he really believes it, why is he not acting on it. If this is true, he’s not taking this seriously. He needs to piss of get off the pot.

My guess is that when push comes to shove, he doesn’t really buy this shit deep down."
150,2020-03-28 07:44:02,fq754q,"This shit definitely seems like a cult.

A pretty good friend of mine has got into this and he's changed as a person honestly.

He kept sending me conspiracy stuff, trying to tell me to look into all these various conspiracies that are way the fuck out there.

I kept telling him I didn't really care about it but he kept sending it. Eventually I asked him if he really believes in this Qanon stuff what is he doing in real life to prevent it or prepare for it instead of just sharing videos. This seemed to piss him off and he told me I need to be a ""critical thinker and open up my eyes""..

He seemed to think he was doing me a great favor of sharing this information with me and trying to open my eyes to what is going to come in this great global shift. 

All in all man it has ruined our friendship. He has decided that he doesn't want to speak to me and would rather speak to his other friends who he has opened them up to this Qanon shit.

These people are fucking quack jobs. It makes you paranoid, it ruins your relationships with people who don't think the same way as you, it's just all fucking weird as hell. Weird times we live in man and I feel this coronavirus has just made them go 10x harder on this.

I can't really offer you much advice but I understand where you're coming from."
151,2020-03-28 08:08:42,fq754q,"There are a lot of good debunkings out there, but two things stood out for me.

First, there is no such thing as Q clearance. It just doesn't exist in the intelligence community. There is speculation that it came from an episode of Archer ([season 6 episode 7](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4389452/?ref_=ttep_ep7)) in which Archer infiltrates area 51 while claiming to have 'Q clearance' from the CIA. Interestingly, that episode aired in syndication just one week before the first Q drop.

Second, 'Q' doesn't seem to know, well anything, about real intelligence operations. He initially used 4Chan [tripcodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imageboard#Tripcodes) as validation, but the tripcodes can be hacked (and, in fact, probably happened). Why did he not use digital signatures (public key encryption) to validate his posts? This is basic knowledge that every intelligence officer should have, and it's relatively simple to implement. But Q didn't seem to know anything about it."
152,2020-03-28 11:22:50,fq754q,"When I look at qanon, they are like white nationalist nazi christians basically, pulling on other pedo christians chains.. Just like the (R) in which their politicians get in trouble with child porn.. This why I wish we could do surprise checkups on their computers/homes, instead of drug checks, to see if they are worthy to be a politician, to check EVERYONE. If its one thing I find, is religion tends to breed these kind people, when they are raised with it.

By the way how christian like are you guys? Is there any subtle racism from him?? I'm sure your not the type to share, just wondering if brave enough or if nothing is there happening, I'm not bashing, its just that, its real easy to connect the dots with people and their behaviors.

 also does he complain about the jews that control reddit? /s jkjk..."

It's confirmation bias run amok, so they only talk about anything that could be considered a success, as if that's all that was ever said. I've looked for examples, but QAnon is just such a convoluted mess that I couldn't make head nor tail of it."

159,2020-03-30 00:38:07,fq754q,"My father has always believed in conspiracy theories but Q seems to have consumed him. One of the worst things with Q followers is that it's all they can talk about and they get incredibly arrogant. They really get off of being 'ahead' of the rest of society. My father has said beautiful things like ""I'm 3 years ahead of the news cycle"", ""if people really knew what was going on they'd literally go insane \[but not him somehow\]"" and some increasingly twisted political views that are solely based on these conspiracies"

If this date passes and nothing happens best to leave it alone. Until then, I’m just watching cabin fever engulf the world with a bag of flaming hot Cheetos.

The thing is, ""Q"" *has* predicted several things that never happen, the gullible still believe. As someone linked above, [here's a small example of bullshit predictions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qult_Headquarters/comments/93v1ui/a_noncomprehensive_timeline_of_qs_failed/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=DebunkThis&utm_content=t1_flq8t5f) that never came to pass, yet people like you still act like it hasn't been completely debunked."

High ranking people with little personal connection to you do this shit *constantly* to make you like them.  Your future unit is going to get visited by the Commandant, some senators, etc and they will all promise they’re going to get you the parts, money, resources, fix black mold, etc.  They say that because it gives you an instant emotional response of: “I like this guy.”

Do they do it? Fuck no they don’t give a shit.  You will not go to ranger school by this guys hand because he has forgotten you exist.  And so has his aide."

There is no saying when, but they usually send an officer or two a year and it depends on units , quotas , ect. Just be a performer and let it be known at your unit , but I doubt they’ll entertain it as soon as you get there. Blah, blah , blah pay your dues ect. You probably can’t just walk on to the course because there is a certain medical physical you need and some other stuff."

I'm guessing that your friend is Army, but sometimes it's not *much* more complicated in the Marine Corps if the school is TECOM funded (i.e., you just have to call the right person at TECOM, get a slot that isn't allocated, and get your command to agree to cut you TAD orders), but for an entry level student officer, it's more complicated enough to make it implausible at best.

FWIW, I know Ranger school sounds cool, but if I could say I were either an IOC graduate or a Ranger graduate...honestly, in my own personal gut, IOC would mean more, even if Ranger grad does sound cooler and gain more attention."

Also, let's say I have 1,000 followers and get 3% back on a $100 item. That $3 is hardly worth the effort to post a photo, remember to screenshot it and upload it 24 hours later, then wait for a brand to send me $3.

And would brands have escrow accounts? How would customers get their cashback?"
243,2020-03-27 00:25:22,fpgiry,"I like the name. 

How would you be making money with this app?

Not to sound horribly stupid, but when you say cash back, does that mean the influencer is buying the product? Is that something they’d be willing to do?"

There are so many tactics influencers use to artificially inflate their followings and engagement rates that are very hard to detect... so I'm not sure investing in any kind of influencer marketing is something that I have any interest in for my business. I'm lucky to have an ad budget at all, and I'm going to invest what small portion of my income I have toward retargeting campaigns. 

Also... it's extremely easy to fake a screenshot. That concerns me.

I would also look at what Guru Club is trying to do. It's a similar concept but it's very poorly executed, and they primarily target Shopify stores."

I'll wait. If this is right I'm sold. And I hope this is right, because it would be great to see the world becoming a better place without this evil cabal ruling the world. I mean, of course we all want Q to be right.

Thing is, while I believe there's a spiritual and consciousness awakening going on, I don't know if Q is right on its prophecies. Or when it says Trump is ""a good guy"", I hope he is, but I'd rather not assume anything for now. Plus, I'm not even american, so what I know about Trump and american politics I didn't see with my own eyes.

But if these prophecies being ventilated turn out to be true then all I can do is to feel happy for all of us.

Either way, stay positive. I believe good things, Q-related or not, are about to happen."

The song has been written for the last 20 years, and Trump had the personality and business savvy to sing it perfectly.  

Because of his cultivated image the Deep State under estimated him.  Until The Plan was already in motion and by then it was beyond too late.  The flood of Global Progressivism labeled stunts rolled out heavy.  That was the light bulb moment for most prior to Epstein.

But here's the bottom line.  1 of 2 things.  Either the greatest story in human history.  Or.  The greatest hoax ever pulled.  But I believe the legit Q data.  The speculation just happens to be yielding proofs.  And Trump... He's certainly not what MSM says.  I trust Q+ and see the validation of drops like the other folks that keep up with it.

#streamTimeMachine"
294,2020-03-25 11:25:40,fon9cd,"its just a peak example of celebs making a generic statement of hope and positivity when they have the means to more directly make a positive impact on the community or on people's lives during this time and (in the case of a lot of these celebs) are not doing anything, which makes it look like cheap activism more about the image of caring rather than about any sort of actual interest in helping the people struggling right now.

It also doesn't help that Imagine is an embarrassingly overused song that a lot of people online think is overrated these days and the cover wasn't pleasant to hear either"
295,2020-03-25 12:04:14,fon9cd,"There's a few reasons really.

First of all, (and it's not really their fault, given that it was John Lennon who sang it) it's a song whose lyrics don't really fit the people singing it, or indeed the person who wrote it (Elton John famously took the piss out of it and sent the re-written lyrics to John Lennon as a joke).

It's a bit tone-deaf (in more ways than one), because we're in the middle of a global pandemic, a time of national and global crisis and we have a bunch of celebs singing a song to us as if it helps matters, which it doesn't, especially when some of them could easily help the efforts to prevent this kind of thing. I don't go in for this whole ""eat the rich"" redistribution of wealth rubbish everyone is coming out with, but celebs can be doing more than they're doing. It just comes off a bit patronising. 

Good God, agree on a fucking key! I can't sing for shit, but I don't sing into my camera and put it on Twitter, so seeing a bunch of people sing a song really badly, really out of key and really out of time, is just excruciating. 

It looked like a bit of a chance to flex as well, as in ""Look how sick my home is while I sing"". It was also ruined by some celebs just totally ruining it by belting it out as if they're playing the X Factor final and it looks desperate.

All in all, it looked like one of those generic statements that people made to try and earn some internet brownie points. It came off really condescending and while the intention behind it was obviously very good, it just looked bad and had the air of ""you don't really know what's going on here, do you?"" about it. If you're someone who's having to use food banks, or live off coupons or have just been laid-off or are having to use the government scheme to get paid, being sung ""Imagine"" by Gal Gadot and a few of her mates, would really boil your piss because they haven't got to cope with anything like that.

That and ""Imagine"" really isn't as good as everyone pretends it is."

It's a good song, don't get me wrong, but people put it up on this pedestal as being the ""be all and end all"" of lyrical composition, but let's not forget that it is a pretty contradictory song, it hasn't really aged very well and it's nowhere near as good as his other songs."

However, one person was intrigued in what I was saying.  ""M-m-m-minecraft...""  Then it was just a domino effect, ten more people are watching.  ""Minecraft...""  A hundred were now watching, this had caught the attention of even the busy drivers in rush hour. Their faces in anticipation, some were even scared. Others were complaining that this isn't the real deal.  ""MINECRAFT...""  But they all suddenly started cheering, shaking, praying. When they heard my tone, my pitch, my timbre.... they all knew what was going to come next. They realized... that salvation of the human race has finally come.  ""Minecraft good Fortnite bad""  And then the silence broke  ""OOOIOIIUUUUUGHHHhJJHHHHHWAASEAAAa//::""  Thousands of people fell to their knees, yelling orgasmically. People starting crying tears of joy, others were running and thanking God, News reporters were already on the scene, broadcasting the entire thing nationwide and consequently the entire world. Hundreds of people came out of their cars, buses, taxis, stores, and subway stations hooting and hollering. It was a miracle unfolding.  I started to say the next sentence relayed to me by our Lord and Savior.  ""M-m-mi... Mine...""  Already some people fainted at just the mere sound of my voice. Even more people came. Some were jumping from planes thousands of feet in the air, others ran or swam miles to here in mere seconds. I think I even spotted a few famous people.  ""MINE...""  Nearly a million people were here now. There's now Europeans, Canadians, Mexicans, Latin Americans, West Coasters, Africans, and even several Asians and one Australian. They were screaming hysterically, bringing gifts for me, taking pictures and videos. Fireworks and confetti everywhere, helicopters, and even Donald Trump was here with his family bowing down to me.  ""MINEC-C-C-CRAFT voice crack""  A billion people were here now. Even animals from all over the world were coming in herds. I could see Pewdiepie &amp;amp;amp;amp; Martiza, Elon Musk, Keanu Reeves, Lil Nas X, 50 Cent, Oprah Winfrey, the Kardashians, and so many other people. Many people were having seizures, heart attacks, and strokes from the sheer excitement, and some were being trampled to death because of the huge crowd. The screaming was deafening. Some just came straight out of their bathroom, school, work, or their parenting... but it doesn't matter now.  ""MMMMMMIIIIINNNNEEECRAAAFTTTTT""  No matter what was your race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, religion, economic class, etc... it didn't matter. All of humanity has come together for this one moment. Millions of people have died to due plane crashes, car crashes, doctors abandoning their patients, parents abandoning their children... just to be here, but it will all be worth it.  Nearly half of humanity is here now. Even the dead came out their graves for this. Everyone is climbing on top of each other and on the walls of skyscrapers since they couldn't fit. So many lights, music, dancing, feasts... yet barely a minute passed. Humanity is very interesting.  10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...  I look at the smiling faces of the crowd in front of me.

The distant echoes of yelling can heard from thousands of miles. This... this was their ultimate purpose in life. This is the culmination of everything that has happened in human history, it is reason why life even existed in the first place. They weren't screaming in terror, they were shouting in orgasmic joy. They could finally die happy. Their entire lives flashed before their eyes as they saw their loved ones. They saw their ultimate fantasy. They can finally be freed from their imperfect bodies in this imperfect world.  The Sun blinked out. The Moon crashed into the Earth. The Earth turned into dust. The Solar System collapsed into a state of entropy. The Milky Way hosts a firework show of supernovas. All the galaxies of the universe colliding with one another. Reality is falling apart. That's because reality doesn't need to exist anymore. It has reached its goal. Spacetime has fallen. Matter ceases to exist. Not even the concept of nothing exists. The universe was never born.  Humanity is gone. Everything is gone. We are now one. Evil doesn't exist anymore. Insecurities don't exist anymore. Fear, sadness, anger don't exist anymore.

331,2020-04-21 10:12:28,g5clj6,"I've been noticing an unusual trend in the quality of Snickers bars over the last decade. I found an old one from 5 years ago and decided to study its composition under my spectrometer and discovered something unnerving. The Snickers bar currently sold in stores contains 43.67% less rare earth elements by weight, when compared to one sold 5 years ago. Do they think they can fool us? It's hard to wrap my mind around why they would do this. Thorium used to make up 12% of the bar, but now it's at 8%, and now there's only 4% Americium compared to 7% just a while ago. It's all been replaced by organic carbon-based matter, like sucrose and poorly crafted carbohydrates. I'm disappointed in the Mars corporation, and I hope my findings will gain enough publicity to force Mars into reverting back to the old formula. Consider this an open letter.

333,2020-04-21 11:53:21,g5aal0,"Honestly, same. I over-intellectualise everything into oblivion. And it doesn't work. I heard good things about EMDR, but you an also try Gestalt which incorporates movement and space into therapeutic process.I have found that reconnecting with my own body is an absolutely crucial first step to better mental health. In addition to therapy I did yoga, but other people choose the Feldenkreis method, dance, martial arts and improv theatre. It doesn't heal everything, but opens you up in ways you didn't think were possible and makes it easier to access emotions without having to intellectually dissect them until they don't feel yours anymore."
334,2020-04-21 12:19:46,g5aal0,"Yeah, I’d agree. My current therapist has also told me I don’t need any more knowledge or insight. My relationship to my emotions is really weird, I know I have them but I chronically go in and out of truly being able to feel them. And there’s only been one person in my whole life that I’ve ever gotten emotional with talking about my life or past. It’s just almost impossible for me to access those feelings and I know that’s what needed to be done to make lasting changes. Honestly, I’m just going to my current therapist because she gets trauma and I just need someone to talk to about my life even if it’s mundane shit. 

Anyways, alternative therapies are great and totally worth pursuing. Somatic therapy is just a therapy that takes the body into consideration and allows access of trauma from a different level than through the language center. Some people on the sub have posted positive experiences about somatic experiencing therapy. There are some ways of dispelling physical tension that I can recommend for at home use, including: “deep psoas trauma release” on YouTube; bioenergetic exercises (devaraj Sandberg on YouTube has some good ones) derived from wilhelm Reich’s theory about the body - I consider him to be the first one to account for the body in psychotherapy - and Alexander lowen who was a student of Reich also has some exercises you can look into. It’s my experience that I was not be able to release the full effects of bodily trauma due to an unconscious holding pattern that i discovered later on. But I still felt release and relief through these exercises. Anyways, I pursued neurofeedback toward the end of last year and after beginning training, I experienced a dramatic decrease in muscular tension that was so much a part of me that I didn’t realize it was there. Changed my life in so many ways. There are a lot of routes to letting the trauma go, you just have to explore what will be the best for you."
335,2020-04-21 11:43:06,g5aal0,"have you heard of EMDR? It's a type of trauma therapy where you do not have to talk about the trauma, just think about it while reprocessing the memory in current time. I'll link a better explanation lol https://www.emdr.com/what-is-emdr/
Also, check out r/emdr for experiences
I cant say much about somatic therapies, but I'm starting with EMDR and expanding once I feel comfortable and safe with my healing. I've heard somatic therapies are really good for trauma, as it gets stuck in the body and needs release."
336,2020-04-21 16:59:43,g5aal0,"Yes to somatic therapy! I'm definitely an overthinker as well, and it can be an avoidance tactic at times.

My therapist practices what I would call somatic talk therapy. 

It took him a little while to figure me out, that what I needed was not to just talk talk talk, in order to get more out of therapy. It clicked one day for both of us, and then he started to stop me more often and I asked him to please continue to do that. 

So in session when I've been yammering on about what all is in my head for too long, he'll bring me back to focusing on what I'm physically feeling in my body. What is my body telling me?

This is where resolutions to the circles and storms in my head are sometimes found."

I think for us, therapy is appropriate if we want a specific therapeutic goal. You might do therapy to learn some healthy coping skills that help you avoid the dysfunctional behaviors you listed. Seems like people believe therapy is the be-all, end-all for our mental health. But I'm well over 40 and.there's only so much I'm going to change anymore. I agree that there are other activities to improve and sustain mental health beyond talk therapy."
339,2020-04-21 13:36:24,g5a2iv,"I think that for most people, therapy is an important first step, but when you're beyond the first few steps its not always helpful. 

When he said that, did you think ""Oh, that sounds true"" or did you think that you want to continue therapy? How true it feels for you is probably the important part. He is an expert so its a good idea to take his advice on board, but also remember its just advice and he could still be wrong if what he said feels wrong to you."
340,2020-04-21 16:47:44,g5a2iv,"I think therapy would be incredibly helpful for you, but it will probably take a long time to really begin to feel like you're getting somewhere.

The title would insinuate that a ""speculative"" approach to MBTI is invalid - that there is a chain of authority when it comes to typing individuals - and that individuals tend to be inaccurately typed.

So: a community of _self-proclaimed_ INFJs, are decreeing that the consensus of the whole internet is not authoritative - yet this small, speculative post is?

_Whaaaaaaaaaa...?_"
406,2020-04-20 04:44:07,g4lof6,J.K. Rowling said she's an INFJ herself in a tweet. But this is really good! Thanks for sharing
407,2020-04-20 07:28:04,g4lof6,"INFJs aren’t thrilled with being INFJ but we accept it. We do our best in a world that shuns Ni and has little Fe. Ideally INFJs would want heaven on earth. People loving one another. That’s all we really want underneath it all. We blend in because we want harmony. But if it is something to important to ignore we will die to defend it. It’s simple really.. we aren’t really happy with this world. So we try to change it into a world we want to live in. An INFJ that brags about being INFJ is either not an INFJ or a not very developed INFJ. There’s no harm in being undeveloped we all have different stages of development at different times. An INFJ that thinks they are important for being INFJ may not be one. Although our personalities vary from Bin Laden to Jesus from Hitler to Nelson Mandela and Gandhi. What makes an INFJ an INFJ isn’t in being a small percentage of a large population.. it’s that we are as different to one another as are our fingerprints. We have subjective meaning and are Ni Doms having abstracts and symbolism that most often are our own meanings. This is why we tend to communicate differently. We have to translate our Ni to be more clearly understood. INFJs that don’t develop their Ni ; it really isn’t their fault because they are taught so young that Ni isn’t acceptable. Not of course knowing what it is about themselves that is so unacceptable INFJs really try to blend in and Ni development suffers because of it. We are proud to make changes in the world and it is most often done covertly and in cause and effect sort of ways that INFJs will understand how this works but others will not. Our predictions, our Fe, how we come about figuring something out in a way that others have to structure and spend hours we can do at times in a matter of minutes. But how will anyone understand Ni? It’s difficult for INFJs to grasp this let alone someone without Ni. So we feel misunderstood not because we are maudlin but because we are not understood. INFJs can have beautiful lives. But we know deep down that we are different. Being different doesn’t make us feel unique it makes us feel different. A true INFJ understands a false INFJ does not. There is a connection that we have to raised consciousness that is easier for us if our Ni is developed. We feel connected. We feel the love of our soul and all souls. Here we find happiness. INFJs are idealist but contrary to what many may think we see all to clearly what the world is. We just don’t like it. We love our planet, the life in it, we love compassion compassion and although people often make us sad we want them to be happy and feel love. We want others to have what isn’t given to us. It isn’t something learned.. we are born this way. It isn’t a walk in the park."
408,2020-04-20 05:31:57,g4lof6,"Could you please show the source that indicates Jung as an INFJ, I'd love to have that data."
409,2020-04-20 06:59:23,g4lof6,"I think this is pretty accurate! But J.K. Rowling is probably an INFJ. It is very unlikely that an INFP would write a book about magic with such a dividing house system haha (Fi dom's main motivations are being respectful of individualities, differences and a deep yearning for freedom of the individual... none of that glows in HP). INFPs also tend to write either helplessly hopeful protagonists or very dark, jaded and sarcastic ones, basically characters that are emotionally extremely intense, because they mostly get inspired by their own emotions (Frodo, Geralt De Riv, Holden Caulfield, a lot of characters from The Raven Cycle) (INFJs often write very different types of characters that can be either known stereotypes -and that makes sense, Fe groups people- for the sake of humor or because of a lack of grounded social knowledge, or colorful and complex when they are inspired by the testimony of people around them - example: Hiromu Arakawa. I think HP navigates between the two).

HP is also about loneliness, yearning for friends and feeling attached to your family or missing it very deeply, which is something that exists within each of us but that is often somewhat denied by INFPs, as they want to show that each individual has their own path (oftentimes coming along with a destiny, but that is an INFx approach) no matter where they come from.

I think a lot of HP is based on finding your group of people, which imo tends to be a speciality of Fe. A lot of Fi doms' characters, no matter the loneliness, tend to want to prove they can handle things on their own hahaha (inspired by their own Te inf fears of lack of independance), sometimes it can crumble, but it often exists as a concept within several of their characters in their stories.

""It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live"" that is something an INFP would never say haha, there is nothing more important for INFPs than imagination.

I can be biased though, and you seem to have a good knowledge of the typing system so I'd be happy to know your point of view :)"

Macbeth [Macbeth]

Rose DeWitt Bukater [Titanic]

Ted Mosby [How I Met Your Mother]


Note: A lot of people disagree with my opinion on Macbeth's type. The way I see it, his dominant function is definitely Ni, as he always thinks through his actions, to the point where they manage to enter his subconcious mind and thus haunt hum deeply, completely taking control of him and his life. In addition to this, his helper Ti function often joins forces with Ni to produce the dreaded Ni-Ti loop, which is what leads to his overthinking, and thus paranoia and constant fear that leads to his mass murder spree and ""by all means"" kind of brutal and sometimes irrational behaviour (eg. When he insisted on killing Macduff's entire family, even though there was no way they could hurt him, as non of them were really ""men not of women born""). Furthermore, he has a tendency to constantly process information in his head, making sure that it is correct, and if not overwriting it with the right information (the third is usually what happens whenever being pushed by Lady Macbeth). His auxiliary function being Fe may seem controversial to so some, as the word ""empathy"" kinda goes out of the window when you think about what Macbeth has done, but the important thing is that he definitely does always base his decisions upon their implications on the outside world (also highlighting the microcosm vs. macrocosm theme of the play), which is also why he is always so cautious as to exactly who kills whom (in the sense that he always makes sure to have a valid alibi, forcing murderers to do his job for him), such that the outside world is not suspicious of him. As such, he has a very strong Fe. Lastly, his Se is his inferior or danger function, which makes sense as he is a very bad improvisor, panicking when he is on the spot, and when forced to do so he appears to be extremely stressed and even confused. We even see this in his final battle with Macduff, as he keeps talking during battle, trying to boost his own ego, which is to me a great indication of stress. Of course, we haven't seen him during other battles (events during which Macbeth is described to be very skilled), but every time we see him trying to be ""all there"", he really struggles. Thus, we have an INFJ; Ni Ti Fe Se.)

I'm also not a fan of typing fictional characters because fictional characters do not have real cognitive functions. Typing fictional characters is for fun and nothing more.

Until there is a fool-proof way of typing, every systematic typing is going to be some way speculative. So, you can hear the reasonings for the differences in typing and make your own judgments based on what seems most likely to be true."

I’d rather suffer a bit so others can have opportunities. Im not unaware of difficulty if anything it affects me more than many people I know, I just dont think that others deserve to suffer more than me so I can be privileged.

Also whenever I see people bragging about being an INFJ and how good it is I get very frustrated. I assume they aren’t truly that type if they are finding it a joyful experience to lord over others as opposed to a lonesome experience. I have never met anyone who could understand me and didn’t find me weird. It’s incredibly isolating and I wish I could find someone who would get me. I’ve been punished all my life for being different and I sometimes wonder what my life would have been like if I were more similar to other people.

Both tasked ordinary men to carry out their message.  Both claimed that their purpose came from God.  I would say that the biggest difference is that Jesus was willing to die for His beliefs and Hitler believed that others should die for his."

Do you see what I mean? To “proclaim” that you have a “definitive” list implies some kind of terminal authority, but in truth, this post is little different from anyone else stating that they have it.

There’s something called “Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem”, which states that a system of axioms cannot demonstrate its own consistency. That’s kind of true here; the methods we use and information we have access to in this subreddit are no different to those of anyone else on the internet.

So how can this post be any more authoritative?

510,2020-04-20 15:13:39,g4lof6,"I do not have enough backup to firmly deny this option, but I do not think so. IxFJs have different challenges in life and in their relationships. ISFJs manage to blend pretty easily, but they start out by having a hard time speaking up for themselves and others, hence they tend to write characters who feel misunderstood and who hate how lonely they feel even though they themselves are judging society or their friends without truly communicating (an excellent example to understand this perspective is Youko Nakajima from the books The Twelve Kingdoms, who is brought to a total different universe where she has to deal with the ghosts of her past silences and how lonely she truly becomes in this world, without any stability or anyone to trust). Si doms are also very much in touch with their internal and past sensations, so I have a hard time picturing any fiction by them that would not be very much permeated by the detailed past and in which the notions of stability or unstability/constant movement/the foreign would not be central. We often get inspired by our fears and longings (here, Ne inf).

INFJs do not have any trouble in firmly defending others and tend to be able to speak up for themselves, because they cannot do otherwise, as they are very sensitive (it just quickly becomes a matter of safety). However, they often feel very lonely as children and feel completely misunderstood, because they truly are. Harry Potter gives me that vibe of courage and fiery protectiveness, but also of loneliness, of longing for a deep connexion with others and family members. Ni doms also tend to be competitive and Hogwarts' Houses system just strike me as such. It's teamwork against teamwork to progress in your abilities, it just fits Ni Fe Ti to the core haha."

That's an interesting thought, but I disagree, as his looking back of past experiences isn't so much due to Si (in the sense that he doesn't reminisce his past because it was ideal and because it's how his present should be, especially seeing as most of said past definitely *wasn't* ideal), as much as it is due to him tryng to indirectly ask his kids if it is okay to date Robin again, and as much as I'd like to erase that ending from my head, that's how it happened (Ted didn't say it directly, but I believe it's obvious that that was the case judging from his reaction when Penny mentioned it). That having been said, I would say that his Ni is dominant, as he is always shown to think very deeply about everything that happens in his life, something that combines with his Ti to produce an Ni-Ti loop that causes him to overthink (eg. Extremely small things such as holding hands with Zoe, the choice of the official Mosbious Designs pen, or even much more significant things such as the way he structures his plans and lies, even the entire internal conflict regarding Robin). Obviously I agree with the auxiliary and tertiary functions, so yeah, that's my reasoning."

I’m not sure written work can be determined Ni vs Ne so much because if we are talking about INFJ vs INTP, INTPs very much want their work to have a point, meaning and direction. Perhaps even more so thanks to Ti-dom.

Lastly, and most importantly, Carl Jung describes himself as a thinker and not a feeler. Feel free to look it up on YouTube

539,2020-04-21 19:37:04,g4lof6,"He’s God. Dude literally created a world full of people because he wanted to love others and be loved. That doesn’t sound like an introvert in the slightest. He was extremely focused on people and spent his time hanging out with them. To my knowledge, the only real times he wasn’t interacting with others is when he was praying, which is him focusing on his relationship with God, another “person.” I would def say he’s an intuitive, he spoke in metaphors too much to be a sensor imo but others might disagree there. As for thinking versus feeling, sure you could totally argue he’s a feeler because he cares about harmony and cares about people, but let’s not forget, he’s freakin God. Everything on this planet is well designed and intricate. Very logic based and perfect. He’s also just and fair and seems to like rational processes. So T/F cannot be decided. For J/P, judging types like structure and order, which he does. He has a plan and sticks to it, as in an entire world plan. Also clearly likes rules, please see the entire Old Testament, particularly Exodus, Numbers, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy. So most likely a J.

Let’s approach it a little differently though. Let’s look at common strengths and weaknesses for different types that he “could be.” I’ll pull it straight from 16 personalities for the sake of simplicity, but if you’d like me to break it down in other ways focusing on my own exposure to an INFJ and this subreddit, I can do that. Anyway, INFJ strengths and weaknesses: creative, insightful, inspiring and convincing, decisive, determined and passionate, altruistic, sensitive, extremely private, perfectionist, always need to have a cause, can burn out easily. Some are correct, but I’d completely argue Jesus is not sensitive, burnt out, or extremely private. Now let’s take a look at the personality type that most fits my earlier breakdown, ENFJ: tolerant, reliable, charismatic, altruistic, natural leader, overly idealistic, too selfless, too sensitive, fluctuating self-esteem, struggle to make tough decisions. He fits some, but once again he’s not sensitive, I doubt his self esteem is ever hurt, and he doesn’t struggle to make tough decisions. So what does this tell us?

He’s none of them! Surprise! Homeboy is perfect and cannot be held down to some pseudoscience that only takes place for imperfect humans on earth. He will use any function he wants when he needs to, as none of them are superior than the other. All functions have flaws and issues, and therefor can only be possessed by an imperfect creation and not a perfect, all knowing being. People like to say INFJs are so great and so caring and “understanding” but at the end of the day INFJs have too many flaws to be comparable to Jesus. They lack good communication and often need to recharge. Imagine going to Jesus with an issue but he’s unable to handle it right now because he needs some alone time. He’s in a constant state of need, people are continuously praying and praising him. He is unable to have an ounce of alone time. He also communicates firmly. While he often speaks in metaphor, he is firm when explaining an issue that someone needs to fix (Matthew 23 is a great example of this, particularly Matthew 23:3-7). This is notoriously a weak spot amongst INFJs. While you could argue that he’s “well developed” I’d like to know when he supposedly became developed. He has always been like this, as God is never changing, therefor Jesus is never changing. Overall, you cannot force humanly personality sciences on Him. That’s not how it works. I can go further in depth using actual functions instead of just the individual letters and 16personalities if you want, but we’re going to reach the same conclusion again. You cannot define God by 4 letters, and it’s an insult to Him to think you can."

It’s not the system itself I’m commenting on, it’s _specifically_ the attitude of the OP, who sought to create a “definitive” post, around a highly speculative issue, by means that were anything but definitive.

To be more specific:

- _“Definitive.”_ According to whom? How was the existing, mass consensus any less definitive than this small post?
- _“No mistypings!”_ I can’t help but think that for someone to go entirely against the grain of consensus in this context, if anything, means that it’s probably _they_ who have the wrong end of the stick - and thus, the post is more likely to be wrong than the existing discussion material out there.
- _""Because I see an inordinate number of mistypings of INFJs…”_ How do you know? And how is this post any more likely to be accurate?
- _""my own comprehensive list”_ Right, hardly definitive, then.
- _""Me!”_ This doesn’t seem like an especially Ni/Fe/Ti/Se comment, IMHO. So the “INFJ”, who doesn’t seem to strongly fit the archetype, is the “definitive"" source on the world’s INFJs. _Ookay._

I know this seems nitpicky, and truth be told, breaking it down like this rather detracts from the irreducible, intuitive reaction I felt to the post - but hopefully this clarifies what I mean.

I'm not really sure what this means, but if you're calling someone's type into question over a *word* then perhaps it is you who has the typing problem. INFJs can't be condensed into such specific behaviour characteristics, that's not how MBTI works."

No, but you _are_ projecting some authority in being able to “validate” whether or not those typings are correct - particularly pertinent given the _“no mistypings!”_ comment. What makes you different from anyone else who thinks they’re right?

> _""I'm not really sure what this means, but if you're calling someone's type into question over a word then perhaps it is you who has the typing problem.”_

Aha, fair comment. It did feed into my perception of the whole “sense of authority”/self-indulgence thing, though.

> _""INFJs can't be condensed into such specific behaviour characteristics, that's not how MBTI works.”_

I’m not sure I’d agree with this. Extroverted functions are, by definition, those that are manifested in external behaviours. It’s a little harder to spot extroverted perception, versus extroverted judging, but either way - if it weren’t possible to condense behaviours into MBTI types, this post wouldn’t make sense.

Otherwise, how would it be possible for us to know someone else's type?"

God created individuals in His image, so it can assumed (and is seen by some scriptures) that we exhibit some personality traits that God Himself exhibits.  And then remember that Jesus was not only fully God, but fully man. He came to earth as a baby.  He slept, He cried, He got hungry and thirsty. Presumably, He had to learn to walk and talk.  He bled.  His feet got sore.  He probably roughhoused with his brothers.  He was a carpenter by trade.  So...in his 33 years on earth, He exhibited traits that God in heaven doesn't need to exhibit.  This is all getting too complicated for MBTI. But given His time living as a human, I don't think it's insulting to try to classify Jesus.  We're just going to be wrong about it."

Jesus is a perfect being. Suggesting He’s an INFJ also suggests that there’s something wrong with anyone that is not an INFJ, and quite frankly I’m over the INFJ glorification I keep seeing in this sub and other subs. He doesn’t have a type. He might have lived on this earth and fully been human and died, but don’t mistake that for being the same as us. He isn’t the same. God exhibits a perfect blend of functions with no flaws. He doesn’t have a type, and to suggest He is only capable of having Te or Ti, or Se or Si, and not all at once is insulting to who He is.

Sometime after accusing Tom Hanks he ended up dead on I-40 which some reddit comments are saying is part of the old Route 66 (they changed the name and broke it up in different segments is what it seems like people are saying) from suicide after “forcing himself off a Bridge and then being struck by a car.

571,2020-04-20 10:28:16,g4krxa,"Answer: Theres a lot to unpack here, so TL;DR at the bottom.

This is gonna be a real cobweb of info so get ready... To begin, you must first get a brief synopsis of the QAnon conspiracy, which at the moment is considered a 'right-wing' conspiracy theory. It basically states that there's a deep state  (called The Cabal) that's run by the liberal elite, where they also do crazy rituals. These claims were based on email leaks of John Podesta, which were posted to WikiLeaks (which we'll get to later). It goes on to say that there's a ring is full of child exploitation and features many prominent members. 

Tom Hanks was accused of being a part of this group, but more in the Hollywood sector (Hollywood has an actual history of sexual exploition, look at Cosby and Weibstein). Other prominent people that were accused are Bill Gates and Lady Ga Ga. People have gone to point out that his reactions to Ricky Gervais's speech also allude to this. [Actor Issac Kappy had called him out on this](https://humansarefree.com/2018/08/tom-hanks-accused-of-buying-13-year-old-girl-from-her-father-and-raped-her-actor-isaac-kappy-recently-called-him-a-pedophile.html) and later Kappy himself apparently died of suicide, in which people believe he was murdered and his death was covered up because he wanted to expose the public. His death coupled with Hank's weird posting behaviour has led to an uproar. 

This all ties back into the pizzagate theory (which needs a whole new explanation on its own) which was basically a conspiracy that alluded to a pizza place harbouring child trafficking by disguising this in the form of emails using covert terms, such as cheese pizza, which meant child pornography. These emails were allegedly traced back to a large sex trafficking system involving Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein was well known amongst many persons, notably the Clinton's. Epstein was later labeled to have committed suicide whilst in a maximum security prison that was under 24/7 surveillance by guards and cameras, yet many find this suspicious and believe that he was instead murdered. The other claim going around is that Hanks flew with Epstein on the Lolita express, a private island of Epsteins where child trafficking had gone on. Trump had also addressed these accusations, where he claimed that they were true and that the elites must be stopped. [The whole pizzagate thing is briefly addressed in this CBS report too if you're interested](https://www.instagram.com/tv/B-xTA39gaDf/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)

Now bear with me, people are now saying that Tom Hanks might've been arrested for paedophilia and the Tom Hanks we saw on the quarantine edition of SNL is actually a deep fake, since he looks looked a bit younger and had a kitchen that was too small for a millionaire's home (people think it was all greenscreened). Then people began doubting his claim of getting infected from Covid-19

As of now, people think he was finally caught up and exposed by the public, so he fled to Australia, with some even claiming that he's got a warrant out for his arrest in the U.S. People believe that he's now being investigated by the Cia too. Others have claimed that he is already caught and imprisoned, but news of this isn't public. Finally, two recent documentaries that are claiming to expose this ring came out on YouTube with the title Out of the Shadows and Pedogate 2020, which helped get this theory going again.

There are also a lot of Russian comments I noticed on his insta; luckily I can read Russian and most of them said for Hank to stop buying kids and murdering them for his own enjoyment and for development of an alleged drug called Adrenochrome (this is supposed to be the drug of the elite and its featured in the movie/book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas as a fictional drug). 

This rabbit hole goes much deeper and I only scratched the surface of this theory. Many claim this is the truth and others explain that this is just a hoax made by the right wingers; I personally don't know. I tried my best to sum it up lol. Feel free to point out any errors/inconsistencies so that I can fix them! )) 

TL;DR Tom Hanks is allegedly involved with a group of elites paedophiles that traffics children and murders them; this claim gained more traction because of the death of Issac Kappy after 'calling Hanks out' and several documentaries posted to YouTube that are recently addressing this topic."

It's one thing to suggest that Hollywood is about money and power - of course it is, it's a major business.

Networks operating around foster care have been broken up before.

Now, you are asking people to take a huge leap of faith going from that point to the rich and powerful are child-murdering vampires, and apparently the only hard evidence of this is a video that may or may not exist and some easily spoofed posts?

I can’t remember where I heard it, (so frustrating) but there was apparently a claim that some celebrity had confessed to being a satan worshipper (I think that was it) on a late night talk show. (Letterman?). 
This “news” spread and it got to a point where people were not only certain it had happened but started claiming to have seen the episode themselves. Not only attention seeking but had actually formed false memories of seeing it. 
The talk show host denied it and the tapes were even reviewed to see if there was anything to it, every minute of every episode was accounted for and there was no confession. 

I believe the story it was tracked to some retirement home newsletter.

I heard it on a podcast but can’t for the life of me remember where. If this sounds familiar to anyone please let me know where to find it!"

You combine a few actual facts with 90% of a convolute of rumors and myths with the only foundation that they were made public by some random ass internet person with less than 0 credibility as a source. 

You draw lines between unrelated events by connecting them via those rumors and myths and jump between topics that have literally no connection if you consider actual facts. You bring up these topic changes that seem to be completely random in a way that tries to make them look natural, but has the need to actually believe all of those rumors and myths.

You argue you don‘t ‚believe’ them - but time will tell whats true. Time did. Again and again. And you still ‚believe‘ in this, because if not you wouldn‘t have written all this conspiracy stuff in a manner that tries to convince others that it is reality.

Your post is a class A conspiracy theorist example. You take a few real facts and construct a false narrative and reality around them by the means of internet rumors, myths and lies.

And what you said is just semantics. If you preface an argument by saying ‚I don‘t say this is a fact, but this is what people say‘, only to explain in great length what these people believe without a single moment of questioning or a sign of thinking by yourself - then you don‘t REALLY say that this isn‘t your opinion. What you say is ‚I don‘t want to be called out on my shit, but this is what I believe‘.

This tactic is and was used not just by conspiracy theorists such as yourself, but also by regimes, cults and discriminatory groups for hundreds of years now.

‚This isn‘t my opinion, but word on the street is that jews are dirty money hogging animals that are worth less than the arian people living here‘.

The tool you use to spread disinformation and lies is the same tool the nazis used. The same tool people use to spread their sick ideas about other human beings being worth less than themselves. It is just used for a different cause in your case, but that does NOT make it right.

Just because you say it is not your opinion doesn‘t mean we can‘t read between the fucking lines. If you spread rumors and myths like this without questioning them a single time, completely unironically with the statement ‚we will see what is true‘ - then you can say that this isn‘t your opinion a million times. Everyone reading knows that this is a lie. You do, I do and anyone able to stop and think for a second knows."

768,2020-04-19 19:49:47,g45ric,"I know, I never would have suspected! Go girl! I love that show 🙂"
769,2020-04-20 02:31:53,g45ric,"""Because all of her friends already had one"" she sounds like a teenager whining to her mother about wanting a cell phone! Like it's a trend, a temporary thing she can throw away or put in the hall closet when it goes out of fashion! My god...."
770,2020-04-19 14:14:03,g45ric,😮 really?!
771,2020-04-19 19:54:51,g45ric,"😟 I hate that lol. She's our new Cameron Diaz!

But seriously good for her, it's all about choice for women."
772,2020-04-19 19:43:02,g45ric,Omg!!! I had her pegged!!! I gotta keep up with the celebrity news...
773,2020-04-19 12:57:20,g45ric,"Yeah, I considered not including her, plus she's hardly famous haha!  But I have really benefited from some her videos, even though I do think she's a bit of a narcissist (which she admits to).  I'm sure we'd both hate each other IRL lol"
774,2020-04-19 19:44:47,g45ric,I was specifically focussing on female role models but yes there are plenty of great CF men 🙂
775,2020-04-21 03:06:32,g45ric,Thank Gawd! If they did have kids you can bet they would have a reality show...
776,2020-04-19 20:02:15,g45ric,I tried to include most people who have publically spoken on the topic. I also admire childless women who refuse to be defined by their lack of motherhood.
777,2020-04-19 17:54:16,g45ric,"She has said several time that she is not a mother and didn’t want children. 

I know a lot of people gatekeep the term and only want it to fit a very rigid definition. But Betty white does not consider herself a mother."
778,2020-04-19 20:32:29,g45ric,I wouldn’t want to get married if i were her. Similar to Oprah i think they realize that they have a lot of money at stake and that marriages don’t always work... but that’s just an assumption.
779,2020-04-22 11:48:58,g45ric,"I lean right, and he gets on my damn nerves with all that women are no good past 30 nonsense. I am 42, I still have men chasing me!  And I have no uterus and a husband. But, he is just stuck in his ways. And has no grasp of human psychology."
780,2020-04-20 09:22:50,g45ric,Yeah really! It would have made everyone in this sub cringe especially hard. This was the early 60s and women were just expected to give birth a year after their wedding. Even her parents in the show were asking her two weeks into her marriage when they were gonna start trying. So I think part of it was social pressure too. But the way she kept bringing it up to her newlywed husband was just...ugh.
781,2020-04-19 14:15:46,g45ric,"She seems to already have a child, and it seems she has a second child now. I don't know how true that is though, just Google and see for yourself."
782,2020-04-21 06:43:23,g45ric,"I'm not sure, they all seem a bit different then most celebs. I know that the Olsen twins quit acting around 2004/2005 and think Elizabeth mostly acts in independent movies."
783,2020-04-19 18:00:31,g45ric,"It's the definition *as defined by this very subreddit.* It's right there in the sidebar.

""Childfree"" refers to those who do not have and do not ever want children (whether biological, adopted, or otherwise)."
784,2020-04-19 20:41:14,g45ric,"Also seeing the way her best friends wedding was mobbed by paps and fans. Just because Taylor was there, her friend isn’t even famous. If it were me it would just completely put me off."
785,2020-04-19 19:59:41,g45ric,Yeah I just saw via surrogacy!
786,2020-04-22 11:52:37,g45ric,Elizabeth Olsen acts in Indie movies? When did Marvel become Indie! She is the Scarlet Witch. And she was in the recent remake of Godzilla.
787,2020-04-19 18:12:06,g45ric,She does not have or want children and didn’t adopt his children 🤷‍♀️ I guess I don’t understand what the big deal is. But to each their own
788,2020-04-19 23:47:35,g45ric,"If I were her, and wanted to get married, I'd just have something super low key and secret."
789,2020-04-22 19:52:54,g45ric,"Well to be fair she mostly does... she kind of developed a cult following before she became more famous. Kind of similar to Juno Temple's career. (at that time, not now)"
790,2020-04-19 23:49:18,g45ric,Agreed. I’d just go to the court house and call it a day
791,2020-04-19 05:22:50,g41zo9,"I've always liked Oprah. I feel like she means well, and did a lot of valuable work in the 90's as far as changing the cultural climate regarding sexual abuse. Too bad she's so out of touch and gullible, vulnerable to quackery, and unleashed things like Dr.'s Oz and Phil on us."
792,2020-04-19 05:24:12,g41zo9,"While we are here she needs to reel her freak reality TV ""doctor's"" in. People are out there actually listening to the misinformation/lies from Teen Mom Drew doc, Mr. I am not a REAL doctor or medicine or psychiatry Phil, and reality sell anything for anyone anytime Oz"
793,2020-04-19 05:07:36,g41zo9,I take it when Oprah says this she isn't speaking about her former guest Dr. Oz
794,2020-04-19 05:19:59,g41zo9,"Oprah has no rôle whatsoever in the conversation around covid. She is not an expert, she is not a political actor, she is only a celebrity. Her musings are not relevant or helpful."
795,2020-04-19 05:07:00,g41zo9," Winfrey began her message to Global Citizens tuning into the broadcast event at home by echoing the words of Nelson Mandela, who once said “that courage is not the absence of fear but the triumph over it”.    

“In every country, in every continent, we have seen phenomenal acts of courage from people who are on the frontlines of this fight against coronavirus,” Winfrey continued. “I tell you, we have all appreciated health care workers. But never like now."" 

""They have done this, often at considerable risk to themselves because, when there are lives at stake, their first thoughts are not about themselves, but for others,"" she said. ""They truly are the best of us."" 

But she highlighted that ""their compassion and their true acts of service is a call to action for all of us."" 

“We need to ensure that governments around the world step up now and provide the health care workers with the equipment, with the funds, with the support they need,”  "
796,2020-04-19 08:05:33,g41zo9,I bet shes nor stuck in a tiny apartment for years.
797,2020-04-19 05:29:50,g41zo9,She was corrupted by the money. Happens to everyone.
798,2020-04-19 05:23:48,g41zo9,That doesn't stop Bill Gates from reaching the front page every day.  He has no experience in pandemics.  He's never been in the virus category.
799,2020-04-19 05:39:22,g41zo9,"Whaddaya mean? She's a pillar of the community...a true 1% er.

Sorry Harley };-/"
800,2020-04-19 06:14:06,g41zo9,"Yeah, pretty much. When your money means you don't HAVE to deal with it, ""it"" being other people and their sometimes frustrating, complex needs, your humility and such just kind of atrophies. That's pretty much why our president is the way he is - never learned to value other people because he grew up rich enough to never have needed to learn to."
801,2020-04-19 05:39:24,g41zo9,"
>He has no experience in pandemics. He's never been in the virus category.

Gates had a Ted talk in 2015 about this very thing we are going through.."
802,2020-04-19 05:59:27,g41zo9,"Like someone else on another thread pointed out, other billionaires have hobbies in sports cars and yachts..his is pandemics .. agreed he isn't a doctor , but he is anextremely well informed and interesting person"
803,2020-04-19 20:51:29,g41zo9,Anyone and everyone has hypothesized about a global pandemic at one time
804,2020-04-19 20:53:02,g41zo9,"True, but hypothesizing and putting your reputation on the line for a duration of dialogue on something like a Ted talk are two different things, though."
805,2020-04-19 20:55:27,g41zo9,LOL who wouldn’t love to be a Ted Talk speaker and give their thoughts on the world. Any of us on Reddit would jump at the opportunity.

837,2020-05-03 15:27:22,gcqmhe,"I love how MOTY is well-written. Guy is my most infuriated villain in the entire choices book. Zoey is sweetheart, so does Luz. I romanced thomas, he's a cutie. And you also gotta love the babe in the wheelchair (forgot her name)"
838,2020-05-03 14:37:28,gcqmhe,Very accurate analysis
839,2020-05-03 17:21:02,gcqmhe,"I love your analysis! And I agree with most of the things you said. I picked Levi because my MC just had crazy good chemistry with him, but I now regret not picking Eiko. He's a rockstar, sure, but she's a ROCKSTAR!        
&nbsp;          

For some reason, I felt very uncomfortable romancing a widower. I know it's possible to move on while still loving your dead spouse and love someone new but I couldn't bear it (probably because in my culture, rebirths are a whole thing and you're supposed to be married to the same person for seven lifetimes at least). From a purely legal perspective, however, there is no conflict of ethics if your boyfriend/sibling/best friend/child represents you in a court of law. It'd be bad if it were a criminal case and he were the prosecutor, or in any case if he were the judge."
840,2020-05-04 11:08:57,gcqmhe,"I agree one thousand percent with your analysis!

Even though I flirted with the three of them in my first play, I settled for lovely Doctor Eiko Matsunaga in the end. I don't regret it! I wish PB would write similar characters to Eiko, she was amusingly written that I couldn't stop loving her since she appeared"

I hope he finds someone amazing (like Eiko, but straight!) and leads a long, happy life.

869,2020-05-03 07:06:04,gcknge,It’s hilarious to me that no one in the cast seems to really be that impressed with Sutton’s high society associations... except Rinna of course.
870,2020-05-03 07:23:53,gcknge,I hope she straightens out the agita with her ex and can be full time next year.  I'd like to see her strut her stuff.
871,2020-05-03 22:34:59,gcknge,I feel like Sutton would fit in so much better on RHONY than she does on RHOBH
872,2020-05-04 13:54:17,gcknge,"I'm way more excited for Sutton than I am for another season of Rinna, the soap opera actress who no longer knows where the acting begins and ends!"
873,2020-05-03 04:53:50,gcknge,"So I guess *someone* out there thinks she’s pleasant and agreeable? I’m genuinely shocked by this. 

I think she’s just tacky and rude so like.. I’m fine if she never gets a diamond. I don’t like her. But it takes all kinds of kinds so she’s clearly someone in high society’s kind. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
874,2020-05-03 16:48:30,gcknge,"Ditto! I’d love to see how snobby she is when it comes to parties, maybe her and Dorit can get into an argument about wine glasses and the proper place to do coke in."

878,2020-05-04 03:18:02,gcknge,i don't trust rinnas praise of sutton. i feel like she's appreciating her from some kind of angle that's self serving... *pls refer to eden sassoon*
879,2020-05-05 06:11:25,gcknge,I would have loved to see her get torn apart by Atlanta
880,2020-05-03 05:38:02,gcknge,"Some of the top tier entertainment bringing housewives are tacky and rude lmao

Sonja, Karen Huger, Ramona, LuAnn to name a few. All with loads to give us. 

I just don’t understand how that’s a flaw for these women. The same with the notion that being thirsty is bad. If we didn’t have thirsty housewives we wouldn’t have these shows. These are all really odd criticisms. 


I know I don’t want perfect, kind, polished, always behaving housewives. How dreadful. How boring. Give me tacky, rude, outspoken any day lol"
881,2020-05-04 05:55:52,gcknge,She seems very try-hard new money.
882,2020-05-03 13:10:59,gcknge,"Yes to everything you said, and I’ll add that the mere fact that Sutton is such a polarizing figure and ubiquitous topic of conversation after so few episodes proves that she is indeed a valuable addition to the housewives canon :). That D&G bra is permanently seared on my mind’s eye. The woman makes an IMPRESSION!"
883,2020-05-03 05:45:42,gcknge,"But Ramona and LuAnn can be funny. Sutton is... not so far, in my opinion."
884,2020-05-03 05:52:17,gcknge,"It’s kind of unfair to compare what she’s given against some fan faves who have a decade of back catalogue. Some housewives take a season to warm up to.


Besides that she has had the odd moment of humour. But I guess it’s partly subjective, partly people deciding “I don’t like her” so nothing she does will be good enough. 


There seems to be a lot of unreasonable dislike for her because she’s rude, tacky and speaks her mind, when that’s the same behaviours of some of the most beloved women across the franchise. 


It’s been 3 episodes and they’ve been the best BH content in ages. I just wish people would lay off the quick absolute judgements. It’s like everyone forgotten how much Teddi was loved her first season compared to now. 


These things take time, why so impatient to disregard or Stan these women. Just roll with the punches lmao"
885,2020-05-03 16:05:50,gcknge,"Luann was an obnoxious humorless snob for her first however many seasons,pepperidge farm remembers. Until she got with it she wasn't an enjoyable watch let Sutton grow into her role"
886,2020-05-03 06:06:07,gcknge,"It’s very baffling!!!I think Sutton is great for the show.She’s rude,snarky,straightforward,has an atrocious fashion taste and generally lacks self awareness.She reminds me of season 1 camille,who was great as a villain.And Sutton has enough money to give zero f*cks."
887,2020-05-03 06:07:19,gcknge,I’m legit confused by the fan base at times. Everyone hates Teddi for being boring but hates Sutton for being the opposite. Everyone hates everything lol.
888,2020-05-03 06:30:15,gcknge,I was literally going to post a discussion about this. I’m genuinely always so confused by this sub... what are they watching for?
889,2020-05-03 06:34:30,gcknge,"To complain? Lol I don’t know


Some people definitely just want to shit on BH, others just hate because LVP isn’t there, or hate that Kyle is. Some are super resistant to change in general. Others judge the women based on if they’d want to be friends with them in real life vs letting them just entertain us (the biggest mistake in veiwing ever imo, these women aren’t all meant to be likeable). Others pre judge, or jump to judgement after a snippet of something.



There’s also the tolerant, the ones who enjoy the ride, embrace change, are open to different personalities, and recognise there are reasons for stirring, snobbery, fakery and discord. Which is entertainment! 


It’s not meant to the “The Real Housewives of Best Friends Who I’d Like in Real Life” but hats how some view it I think."
890,2020-05-03 04:55:20,gcklwh,Fuck Ellen that fucking cunt. Go ahead with the episode.
891,2020-05-03 18:00:28,gcklwh,I want to cum inside Ellen's deep blue eyes.
892,2020-05-03 23:13:39,gcklwh,A thousand times yes. This would be an awesome episode
893,2020-05-03 23:37:12,gcklwh,"Oprah and Ellen comparison episode would be lovely.

Edit: spellcheck"
894,2020-05-03 13:00:02,gcklwh,  Fuck yeah
895,2020-05-03 16:48:56,gcklwh,I didn’t have much of an opinion about Oprah until she paraded around that disfigured chimp attack lady as if it was something empowering for her and not just cheap shock value. If she wanted that she could have just shown pics and let the poor woman stay home but noooo let’s make her feel bad by revealing her broken visage in front of an audibly gasping audience.
896,2020-05-04 17:37:19,gcklwh,"My knee jerk reaction was who gives a fuck about fucking Ellen? But if it's a comparison between Ellen and Oprah to see who is worse, then it would work."
897,2020-05-03 14:03:27,gcklwh,whats with the hate? guess a show is really warranted to delve into this
898,2020-05-03 22:18:47,gcklwh,Member that time the blue check marks wanted her to run for President? Our politics are a joke
899,2020-05-04 18:11:30,gcklwh,I feel they both need their own episode. Oprah has had a career way longer than Ellen.
900,2020-05-03 15:04:36,gcklwh,"There have been stories about how insane and rude she is back stage. She allegedly made fun of someone from way up north because her peoples culture ate seals and whales, completely ignoring that that is the only food source in the area. Attaching 2020 American culture lenses to hundreds of years ago in the damn arctic. Theres a lot more, but I cant remember. Shes been getting a lot of shit lately."
901,2020-05-03 15:26:57,gcklwh,"She also pissed off a lot of people for considering Bush as her friend, hanging out with him, and saying nice things about him. For many people, he is a war criminal who has blood on his hands. Btw, She just dismissed the critics, and she basically said something like: people should stop being so hateful because there is nothing wrong with a leftist being friend with someone from the other political spectrum"
902,2020-05-03 21:38:29,gcklwh,She buddies up with war criminals.
903,2020-05-04 04:13:58,gcklwh,"“Hey, Trump opened the door for idiot celebs who have no business whatsoever running for President, why not *our* idiot celeb?!” 

I’m pretty sure no matter what the letter next to their name says, it’s not exactly the greatest idea on the planet. It doesn’t take a political science major to know the best thing for them to do would be to run someone who actually seems competent and classically presidential. Biden must not be the only one of that side’s leadership going senile because apparently they’ve forgotten they already tried and succeeded with that strategy 12 years ago."
904,2020-05-03 16:11:09,gcklwh,TJ might approve though. He’s famously racist against the Eskimos.
905,2020-05-03 18:46:49,gcklwh,">~~Leftist~~

Liberal"
906,2020-05-03 16:14:28,gcklwh,"True, Ellen should have him on to make fun of eskimos together."
907,2020-05-03 23:37:50,gcklwh,What's the difference?
908,2020-05-04 00:38:25,gcklwh,"liberals are centrists or moderate right wingers who think they are left, leftists are just left."
909,2020-05-04 00:39:04,gcklwh,"Those aren't liberals, you're talking about democrats."
910,2020-05-03 01:07:57,gcho4x,"As a Spaniard, I hate those kind of videos. They're cringy (in my opinion), and I don't like them. If you would like to practice a conversation with a native btw, you can hmu"

If Oprah compared her struggles with a duvet cover to what other people are going through, that would be tone deaf.  But she didn't.  Also, I don't know this for a fact because I'm too lazy to look it up, but I'm guessing Oprah has put a bunch of time, energy and money towards helping people through this- just like she does with everything else."

998,2020-05-01 19:04:37,gbfv73,He does that all the time because he’s steering the show. I’m not sure what was naive about her story really. She was acknowledging her own shortcomings and failure to show empathy with the right party in a situation. Neither Miles nor Jack really engaged because she said all there was to say about it I thought.
999,2020-05-01 19:20:29,gbfv73,"No worries. I certainly didn’t know this part until yesterday but I just posted this image as it’s own post: https://reddit.com/r/thedailyzeitgeist/comments/gboara/restaurant_owner_shared_this_breakdown_of_grubhub/

That is just astounding. Margins in the food industry are so thin as it is that this cost the restaurant money to even do. But then if they don’t participate with grubhub or whoever then they’re left out of folks minds when looking for food."

1003,2020-05-01 19:11:11,gbfv73,"Sure yeah totally fair. I guess I notice that Jack will really engage for a long time if he's in to a story or a gag but he'll just cut the story off and move on if he's not feeling it. You can tell when he'll add a little something or acknowledgement to someone's story versus him just immediately moving on.   


Re: the naivety of the story - I think she did a great job seeing the error of her thoughts and the perspective. It's naive to hold Beyonce on such a pedestal when she's really a terrible person. Like when Bridget said ""I feel like I know her (in heavy quotes)"" that just cringed me so hard."
1004,2020-05-01 19:44:24,gbfv73,"Jesus, well I already don't use Grubhub, but I'm certainly not about to start using it. I should let my roommates know this, they use it from time to time."
1005,2020-05-01 21:38:56,gbfv73,That was a little disappointing. I was expecting some Gal Gadot level fuckery but it just seems like your run-of-the-mill rich celebrity bullshit. Maybe I missed something or maybe I just don't have a lot of faith in uber wealthy people not being clueless and taking advantage of people.
1006,2020-05-01 19:17:34,gbfv73,"Ah, gotcha. I think the use of “heavy quotes” there was to imply she doesn’t know her at all. Like putting quotes around the word “krab” on seafood.  Felt she was acknowledging she’s a big fan but that doesn’t translate. Beyoncé is important to a lot of people. She can certainly be problematic but I think she ranks kinda low, in my opinion(could be totally wrong). 

Sometimes I think Jack is looking for an entry point to get to the next topic or ad break and the show also gets edited by the great DJDanl so it’s not always conversationally fluid. He may have engaged but it wasn’t worth keeping it in? I see how that could be heard that way though."
1007,2020-05-01 21:44:33,gbfv73,"Yeah for sure. I know Jamie and some other guests have bagged on Beyonce but I'm not going to dig through the archives right now. The whole hospital and suing over her baby's name is pretty shitty. 

Definitely won't argue that Gal Gadot is worse."
1008,2020-05-01 19:47:12,gbfv73,"I absolutely see your points. I've already made enough assumptions so I won't continue to assume anymore. 

So we should just blame DJDanl ;)"
1009,2020-05-01 20:32:48,gbfv73,Haha it’s all good. Just friendly convo! And DanL is the god so yeah we can blame him.
1010,2020-05-01 10:33:22,gbecnv,"I never jam LC, and I always work towards 6 mages late game. As far as your first point, I definitely cram all my units on the back line. It's the best way to pull out all those pesky corner comps. 

So it's basically now a matter of what units. Barring no 3-stars, 2x storm spirit plus 2x earth seems to be the easiest and best composition to grind yourself to late. This is of course with either ember spirit or  active. You'll want mages and humans as well, so crystal maiden and kotl preferably as your core, with just spirits as your other units. When late game comes I try to three star maybe earth spirit and such and squeeze in 6 mages. I won't go 6 unless I can get a lich in there, but it also involves making sure I have an ogre magic chillin too. Then probably whatever other mage you managed to roll into. 

Spirits is super beatable, but not when you focus on them exclusively. So I'd drop the three warrior stuff and just work on building your comp. 

Can't contest for it now tho, and it requires that density of spirits to really work, or the alliance soup comps will eat you"

1012,2020-05-01 15:59:40,gbecnv,"back row is all good, but if you're playing ember he teleports to the back and draws aggro while your team moves up. it's actually better to not use ember at all unless he's 3* with deso or battlefury."
1013,2020-05-01 10:35:39,gbecnv,"Thanks for the guide. I definitely think Earth Spirit is underrated early on (one of only a few heroes with 10 base armor) but am skeptical of Ember getting off spellcasts reliably, which scares me away from a pure Spirit build. I guess you can play pairs, but against any early corner board setup I feel like you just kind of lose?

I mostly play Spirits after a 4 Primordial + 3 Mage opener (Tiny, AW, Razor, Morph, Storm). You can play Earth and a 3rd Warrior at 7, then add Void Spirit at 8. Usually after that I try to swap in Enigma for AW, and add TA or FV to move from 4 Prim into 3 Void. I've been playing around with using Slark here as well to complete Assassins and Scaled, but haven't fit it in super cleanly yet.

Spirit isn't a huge core at any point but just a decent midgame damage option with some strong units that allows me to coast for a bit and level. I think going highly specific builds like this is going to fall out of fashion with the impact of the new patch, though. It seems to depend a lot on how many compositions your key units can fit in."
1014,2020-05-01 12:02:23,gbecnv,You can also do void/assassin spirits with Templar assassin and faceless void in addition to the 8 you mentioned above.
1015,2020-05-01 12:51:36,gbecnv,"4 humans can work too, it's a fun variant"
1016,2020-05-01 12:07:00,gbecnv,"So do you shift out of Spirits or do you leave 3 in while also trying for 6 Mages?

3\*Earth felt like a trap every time I did it. 2x2\*+1x1\* is ideal imo, otherwise you lose 1-2 silences and reliable, quick-refreshing Delta Slam casts. They also soak up dmg so well. I'd much rather try for 2x2\* Void or if 6 Mages, 2x2\*Morph.

&#x200B;

I just gave LC Spirits one more good honest try and...nah. The fact that you need to wait until the duel is over for it to even Delta Slam (provided it survives the duel at all) is the worst part, but also the long cooldown on it means that she can only do it once per normal game. Also no debuff effect isn't great, double damage is whatever.

&#x200B;

I'll try to work more towards 6 Mage + Spirit again if possible."
1017,2020-05-01 17:07:33,gbecnv,Depends what you are fighting. Is bad vs mages and hearthless if they have barricades. Is great vs brawnies and knight once you get the void alliance.
1018,2020-05-01 18:17:43,gbecnv,This! Take out your 2* ember for 1* storm
1019,2020-05-01 12:01:35,gbecnv,"Earth Spirit is great yeah. 10 armor, decent DPS, still pretty high HP at lvl1 and after one of the most recent patches, his cooldown is pretty low. The silence can be game-changing and its damage is not bad either, especially if the angle lines up.

Ember I really like, but the key is to have 2 humans and give him either a mana item (Eul's Scepter is nice since he will be attacked quickly) or use one of the odd damage items that you can't make much use of in Spirits anyway. He has very high base damage and mediocre attackspeed, so Butterfly, Moonshard or Hand of Midas/Silver Edge are great. If not, just put him out front.

Corner setups..yeah. RNG is a big factor here. As mentioned, I try to pull by putting my guys in the back which works half the time, unless they have barricades and are blocked in properly.

I rarely feel that incorporating spirits elsewhere works well, unless I get very lucky in the shop and hit 6 Mages while also getting 2\*Earth, 2x2\*Storm and 2\*Void so I usually forego either Spirits or 6 Mages, typically depending on what the shop throws my way."
1020,2020-05-01 15:00:31,gbecnv,"Sure, but is Void worth it in Spirits?"
1021,2020-05-01 16:52:52,gbecnv,"Just had a game where everything lined up well, no Embers. Then I made the mistake of not thinking about it and taking Storm to 3\* and promptly lost the showdown to a Brawny team and ended up 2nd, despite 2x2\*KOTL and 2x1\*Lich"
1022,2020-05-01 21:09:47,gbecnv,When should you go for void/assassin spirit alliance as opposed to 6 mage comps?
1023,2020-05-01 18:15:20,gbecnv,"He is talking about Ember, which is the least important spirit in the build. You want as many silence, disarm and break effect as you can, so I would even take out 2* ember for 1* storm"
1024,2020-05-01 12:09:31,gbecnv,"Also, is it just me or is Enigma totally underwhelming? Against Brawny it should shine, but they're usually almost all frontline so they don't stack up. And even if it's a corner setup, you really have to be lucky to hit it properly as it's just 9 sqares."
1025,2020-05-01 15:33:58,gbecnv,Very much so. Spirit/Assassin/Void is one of the highest dps alliances late game.
1026,2020-05-01 18:13:34,gbecnv,Always go with as many spirits as you can against brawny. 6-mages is essential if you want to beat 2000+ HP brawny team
1027,2020-05-01 21:24:07,gbecnv,When the top board is brawnies
1028,2020-05-01 18:27:29,gbecnv,Try to understand the comments before you reply them
1029,2020-05-01 18:55:48,gbecnv,"Enigma is great, reliably high damage unless he whiffs, but he won't build ultimate reliably unless you frontline him aggressively. He needs to be among the first to cast to get big value.

I think it's incredibly worthwhile lategame if you can stay 4 Primordial and add 3 Void."
1030,2020-05-01 22:23:50,gbecnv,"Enigma *is* underwhelming. He only gets one cast off, and sometimes not even then, and one cast of his ult is not worth a roster slot considering his health and auto DPS aren’t impressive"
1031,2020-05-01 19:17:10,gbecnv,"DPS isn't everything though. I just ran it and while it's nice to see KOTL have auto-attack damage for 3k+, it's not of much help when you Delta Slam too infrequently and the few that you do don't hit due to RNG. You really need those disarms and silences to hit if you don't want to get melted straight away."
1032,2020-05-01 18:47:24,gbecnv,"Unless it's a refresher Ember, I would rather take the disarm effect when Storm Delta slam. Void assassin spirit is okay, but much less reliable than more Delta spam"
1033,2020-05-02 11:03:56,gbecnv,"Yeah. I feel if it still had the old range of beta Enigma (maybe at reduced dmg) it would be more worth it. I have to admit, sometimes the slow is really a deciding factor because it's so strong vs. melees when placed well, but those are so few times. 

It's like all the issues with Disruptor, but he often gets more casts off when you have lots of Brawny kills, also has lower CD, the cast time is basically instant (enigma has about .5s wind-up) and his range is 2 instead of 1 cell. And he's giving others heals when you have Warlock Alliance. And his DPS is slightly higher. So yeah.. And DPS wise, a 2nd Morphling is so much better. In Endgame, I kept Enigma for the Primordial bonus, but even then you need 4, so Razor, Moprh, Enigma and? You need to play another subpar unit like Tiny or Io? Not great, unless it's 3*Tiny."
1034,2020-05-01 19:57:27,gbecnv,Transition out of the mages when going for it.
1035,2020-05-01 20:02:29,gbecnv,Oh..I see.

1037,2020-06-26 20:55:58,hga8ox,Just listened to tlop not to long ago
1038,2020-06-26 18:06:28,hg9gfh,"Yoooo. We really appreciate this comment, and truly, any comment that gives constructive criticism about the listener experience of our show. It is super important to us that we get listener feedback that is honest. So first let me say your feedback is officially in the ledger. We have the power to make change in our show and your comments will go into how we approach this stuff going forward. Specifically, the Covid point is heard. I don't know if this will necessarily speak to all of your concerns, but nonetheless I would say a few things to give context: 

\-We listen to our own show ""in the wild"" too, to try to get a sense of the experience. And man oh man, has our show been JAM PACKED WITH STUFF recently. Part of the reason for that: Doing trades/promos with other shows is one of the ways we try to grow our audience, especially when we have a new series or new season out. The currency of those trades is ""impressions."" Sometimes, we need to help another of the WBUR shows deliver impressions they've promised, etc. It's complicated and while it's supposed to help the listener discover new shows (including ours!), it doesn't always sound great. We try to make those promos as clear, fun and simple as we can. But when there are a lot of them, it's annoying. Good news--maybe--is that it won't last forever! Our promos are temporary as are our ads.  

\-Another piece here is that sponsorship pays the bills. Lots of ads in our show is usually a temporary thing AND a really good sign that we're getting revenue--which helps the show survive and the producers making it stay employed. There really is a direct relationship there, even in public media, and especially in podcasts. The more our show is sold, the more the powers that be can say ""this show is worth making, literally."" As they tap the ash from their golden leaf cigars. Just kidding. Seriously though, it is true that we get excited for ads because it means our show is doing well. 

\-A huge portion of public radio is funded through listener support, which is why, generally, public radio content has fewer ""ads"" that sound different. Public radio podcasts, which are ""new"" to the public radio world (it's all relative) aren't quite the same because the public radio world hasn't figured out the \*podcast\* listener support piece yet (even though non public radio podcasts generally HAVE). Endless thread is actually on the cutting edge of this in our shop! We've started a bonus content feed for monthly sustaining listeners to help fund the station and thus the show going forward.  AND, we are exploring how to potentially make that feed an ""ad free"" feed as well. This is a big deal for us--and the people who have become monthly sustainers--thank you thank you thank you so much for supporting the show and the station. Right now, it's a small piece of our show's contribution to station revenue, but we hope to keep growing it to make the show even more independent and sustainable! 

\-Last thing: Sponsorship is tricky for public radio. We try to do it in a way that is unobtrusive, but honestly, in my opinion, public radio still needs to learn some things from the way the rest of the world does it. When I first got to WBUR, I suggested our team do ""host read"" spots. Partly because they bring more revenue, but also because...Jonathan Goldstein and Heavyweight inspired me to believe that we could do it in a way that would be less annoying to our listeners. That said, if you would rather someone other than me and Amory do it...or have other feedback in terms of placement, style, whatever--We'd love to hear it! 

Thank you so much for writing and for listening, even when there are a lot of ads! 

Dwayne The Brock Johnson"
1039,2020-06-26 15:29:36,hg9gfh,"Isn't there a membership program where you can pay for an advert free rss feed?

A lot of podcasts I listen to do that, so I may be wrong."
1040,2020-06-26 17:08:05,hg9gfh,"I get a little tired of hearing the same ads over and over and busting up the content that I'm interested in, but I guess it hasn't really bothered me because I can easily skip ahead 15 seconds with my Bluetooth headset.

 But the biggest reason I can get past it is just because I like Endless Thread so much and I want them to make money so they can keep doing what they're doing. I know this is like ...obvious, but that really is why it doesn't grind my gears. 

That said, I like that you've brought it up! I think you have some valid points about how there may be other advertising formats that might be less grating. 

I would imagine their team considers this sort of stuff and does the best that they can with the options that they've got, but who knows!  It's always good throw stuff out there."

I started really paying attention to how cute you guys are when you read them. Also, I totally love that you promote other podcasts! I'll be checking them out :)"
1042,2020-06-26 15:31:41,hg9gfh,"Adverts are typically the easiest way to monetize. If you don't like them, you can always skip them."
1043,2020-06-26 17:29:36,hg9gfh,"Well said! Monetizing is obviously so damn important. I’ve seen many creative ways podcasts integrate ads, such as reading them themselves or having others talk about the products in mini journalistic ways. I agree that their team must obviously have considered all of this. I’m genuinely curious to hear why they’re done in this way I suppose."
1044,2020-06-29 19:14:58,hg9gfh,"We appreciate you, pencilvia! Did you hear our shout-out to you at the end of the BLM episode?"
1045,2020-06-26 15:39:21,hg9gfh,Yeah I know. I’m not complaining about ads per se but about how they jive with the Reddit brand / experience / history
1046,2020-06-26 17:57:50,hg9gfh,"Yeah, me too!"

1085,2020-06-29 02:27:40,hffgl0,"Wife and I binged the.first season today. Here are my thoughts. 

I liked the concept of the show. I like where it's going plot-wise, and most of the cast has done a great job portraying their characters. 

However...

Why the need for the unnecessary SJW injections? It wasn't overly done, but it was obvious that certain scenes were used as vehicles of SJW rhetoric. 

The entire episode where they go to the grey zone and Dylan is wanting to virtually grow up, so he gets the patch that turns him into an 18 year old female. 

The show used this time to interject ""gender as a spectrum"" and to not ""degrade women by looking at them"". All the while multiple times throughout the show other characters referred to Nathan as ""the hot one"". 

Then there's Byron the overtly obvious and annoying alpha male who was shown to be toxic and even though Nora really didn't do anything but ask him a few non-superficial questions, he somehow was ""fixed"" to be now care about a relationship. Then Nora used him to basically keep her job, them kicked him to the curb. Then he was shown to be desperate and creepy. 

Then there's Nora and her father. He obviously believes in a different afterlife and wants to trust in his faith. Nora thinks religion is stupid and he should abandon that to be ""uploaded"" for her own selfish reasons. 

Maybe it's more prevalent than I initially thought..."

1090,2020-06-25 16:05:46,hffgl0,"You got me there. Still, it's not so much that I enjoy it as much as I appreciate the humor for going that far. I would be equally amused if they cut out and didn't show it, if that makes sense. I tend to have a darker sense of humor than some people, so I like when a show goes that far."
1091,2020-06-30 02:50:33,hffgl0,"Same. Those were the parts that really bothered me, especially the constantly calling Nathan hot part. The rest I sort of viewed from the point of view that if this was to actually happen, people are like this. They're flawed, and although the show thinks that they are in the right, it's oddly enough more realistic because they're wrong. I dunno if that makes sense, but it was the one thing that kept me watching it, as well as the chemistry."

WTF is the ""academic nature of a conservative mindset""?

The correct meaning of the word conservative is right in the word itself. It is has nothing to do with money or the economy by default. 

I am not a conservative person because I like forward movement in whatever sense, even at the cost of some safety we have or feel we have. A conservative person however wants to preserve the good things we have or feel we have. The conservation of good times. And I can totally relate to that  Those are just two different ways to think about things or in particular about how to think about progress."
1093,2020-06-26 02:30:03,hffgl0,"Exactly he’s a parody of one of the Koch brothers, who have been a cancer on American politics for decades."
1094,2020-06-25 16:08:35,hffgl0,"Right?  Don't want to be depicted as superficial, racist, and evil?  Don't be superficial, racist, and evil and the attack falls flat in the face of facts."
1095,2020-06-25 16:03:42,hffgl0,"That's the funny thing though, I've been reading up on Civil War era history and discovering that the Republican party wasn't always like that. In fact, the Republican party was formed in opposition to the Kansas-Nebraska act, an act passed to keep slavery legal in states that wanted it to be legal. Not everyone who is a conservative is crazy rich and selfish. That's my one gripe with the politics in the show; it subtly spreads the narrative that they are."
1096,2020-06-25 04:51:11,hffgl0,Those are why he refuses to watch it WITH YOU.
1097,2020-06-25 04:39:19,hffgl0,"Same! It would be so much better without them. I understand that they're trying to be realistic and that people would be like that, but they should at least cut out before it happens or something."
1098,2020-06-25 16:51:18,hffgl0,Well keep reading through history and you’ll arrive to the point in history where the two party’s ideals switched.
1099,2020-06-25 18:42:02,hffgl0,.... if you have to go back 150 years to find good things your political party has done ....
1100,2020-06-25 06:16:42,hffgl0,Lol. Probably. I ask him if he watch it at all after the first 2 episode. He said nope. It makes him uncomfortable. TBH I think it the “ death” theme also.
1101,2020-06-26 06:55:29,hffgl0,"That's a myth that's been spread for years. There was some realignment, yes, but it was much, much more complicated than a simple switch. It was more political than anything from what I've gathered. The biggest switch refers to one guy who utilized the racism in the south to essentially get elected as the best candidate for president. He lost because he only had support in the south and not the rest of the Republican party. Having done more research, it seems the Republicans were actually really racist in the south even in the beginning. It still doesn't mean that the entire party is racist. I guess that's why the show bothers me in that aspect; it chooses to only show a simple picture - Republican = bad family, Democrat = good. It's brief, but is irritating nonetheless, considering that both sides have had some serious issues in the past and continue to have them today. It's just not something you can sum up with stereotypes."
1102,2020-06-26 06:35:44,hffgl0,"I'm not that well versed on the 1900s, I admit. I just am in approval of what the party still stands for today, for the most part. That and there was no switch."
1103,2020-06-26 15:02:49,hffgl0,"What myth? It literally happened. Dixiecrats left the Dem party when the Dems began introducing more civil rights initiatives and this is when it began. Then once Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, Southern Racist Democrats began leaving in mass. 

It wasn’t “one guy who utilized the racism in the South”. Democrats began supporting more civil right focused acts, thus pushing the racists out of their party and over to the Republican Party who then began holding onto southern states due to their opposition of these initiatives.

Then comes Reagan....a well known racist responsible for some of the greatest destruction in black communities since the 80s.

Please keep reading."
1104,2020-06-24 22:52:08,hfax6j,"Okay so extra details: I asked her at which point Melody became higher than me in the totem pole. Around the time that she met Melody, I had just gotten hired by my first airline and became a flight attendant which was my life long dream. She said that I left a void in not only her heart but her family’s too. She said Melody really stepped up and was there for her. I told her that as my friend, instead of recasting me, she should have been supporting me. Not to mention that every time I tried to hang out with her, she was with Melody and her family. Why would I third wheel two families? Especially a family in which my best friend has been badmouthing???? 

I asked her who was supposed the be the nanny and apparently there was an implication that everybody would step up and do something for the trip. Apparently “no one” was gonna get dumped with the kids. When I was in the group text, MVA had a separate one going with some things they were gonna suprise Josie with, apparently someone decided that I would be in charge of the baked goods and setting up the bar for the weekend 🙃

Apparently the trip was supposed to be a couples trip even though the brother of the groom is single. It was apparently suggested that he and I share a room."

What the actual all hells is wrong with some people?!
Thank you for the update, and may any other brides in your life not be total lunatics."
1109,2020-06-24 23:05:34,hfax6j,"Faaaaak that paragraph after the oprah scene where things went south was a kick in the gut, really hoped you'd still be friends given what you said about the previous extent of your friendship

But that was before she showed her colors, glad you've left that abusive relationship and hope you got some sick nails now"
1110,2020-06-24 23:11:44,hfax6j,Sounds like Josie is arbitrarily handing out bridesmaid titles like candy and sucks.
1111,2020-06-24 23:38:53,hfax6j,">	. I asked, why did the kids get a room, who did the floor plan, why wasn’t I on the list? So on and so forth. She had great answers to every questions

I’m really curious, what were these “great answers?”"
1112,2020-06-25 01:03:36,hfax6j,So where was Alexandra and her boyfriend going to sleep? Did they kick the kids out and give them a room?
1113,2020-06-25 03:57:50,hfax6j,"A long time ago and a friend group i have long abandoned... these five girls were supposedly all my best friends (a la sex and the city style). We hung out all the time and did all kinds of stuff together. One of them got engaged and we were all immediately inducted as the wedding planning crew. 

I got put in charge of decor, center pieces, bouquet creation, bachelorette party shirts, crafting shoes for the bride (she wanted custom shoes with a very specific design on them), painting backdrops (shes a theater kid), etc. I busted ass (including using a full week of my vacation time at the brides behest) to get everything finished well ahead of schedule to accommodate any changes or touch ups and to soothe her anxiety.

A bit later the other girls are in the group text talking about how beautiful the invites are. I said i didn’t receive mine yet but im sure its gorgeous. Crickets. For several hours. Which was super weird for this group. I was then informed by the bride that I was on the C list for invites. The current group was the A list friends and family. The most important people in her life. If anyone rsvped no, shed send invites to B list and if all of them rsvped no, then shed start sending invites for C list. Even though id been in this friend group for four years, she said I simply couldn’t be A list or B list as I was too new to her life. I should be grateful to be C list at all but her future husband pushed for me to at least be on that versus not considered in any form. So i was angry I’d done all this free labor for my supposed friend and i wasnt even invited to the wedding. But hey, i was “ssooo sweet” for doing all that for her."
1114,2020-06-24 22:35:24,hfax6j,"I'm so sorry! 

Thanks for updating, I was really hoping it would all work out for you and your ""friend"", but she obviously is not actually a friend.

I cannot even believe she asked you to get her kid! Bitch, please! Go take advantage of someone else!

I'm glad you are doing okay without them!"
1115,2020-06-24 22:35:49,hfax6j,Sorry you found out the hard way how little she respects your friendship. At least you didn’t waste your money and won’t have to waste any more time on her.
1116,2020-06-24 22:53:44,hfax6j,I'm so sorry she's such a shit (ex?)friend.  Glad you do have true friends in your life.  You should all make elaborate fancy plans of your own on Josie's wedding night!  And be sure to post lots of pics on social media. :)
1117,2020-06-25 01:52:58,hfax6j,"Thank you for the update!!!!! Fuck those bitches!!!!!! I had to walk away from a friendship that was toxic. It was/is still hard, but it gets easier. Glad you took the first step in removing negativity."
1118,2020-06-25 02:27:40,hfax6j,"I’m glad you figured all this out before spending $500 for a couch or being pimped out to the brother. I mean I spent a lot of money to go to my friend’s wedding but 1 - I was part of the wedding party, 2 - it was in San Diego and I spend a few extra days to enjoy sunny California. I just can’t believe that she is this self centered. I love that you had a girl last day out to celebrate to end of that toxic relationship! If there’s any updates let us know!"
1119,2020-06-24 22:38:24,hfax6j,Wow! It's good she showed her true colours now rather than after you had invested more her wedding/friendship. I'm sorry it played out like this.
1120,2020-06-24 22:48:31,hfax6j,"I can't believe she had the nerve to ask you for a favor after treating you like that.

Sorry OP"
1121,2020-06-24 23:32:21,hfax6j,Fuck. That. Pussycat. 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕
1122,2020-06-25 02:21:39,hfax6j,"Walk away from that friendship dude. I had a best friend. She was getting married and while we were hanging out one day, talking about something not wedding related at all. She interrupts me and says ""IM NOT HAVING BRIDES MAIDS."" I immediately thought to myself, yes you are but I'm not invited to be one. My intuition hurt, but it wasn't my wedding. I just didn't want to push the subject.

Show up to the wedding and low and behold she has bridesmaids. Her mother started in on me telling me I'm rude for refusing to be a bridesmaid. I said ""Sam told me she wasn't having any."" 

The bridesmaids speeches were pretty terrible. I'm not one for public speaking and I had laryngitis on her wedding day. I some how made a speech that made people laugh and cry (and was able to project my voice for the speech. I made some dumb joke about how the wedding took my breath away lol.)

I pretty much let that be my mic drop moment. We only saw each other a few times afterwards and it took her saying some dumb shit about my 1 year old baby for me to be like you're a shitty friend and an awful person and drop her for good.

Save yourself the emotional labor of a shitty friend. Dont show up. Dont give her money. Dont let her sweet talk you into thinking she values your friendship."
1123,2020-06-25 13:15:43,hfax6j,"To start off I’m on your side. She was a cow. 

One of the issues I will gently say is that you WERE wrong for going on and on about being a bridesmaid. In THIS instance it was 20 people in a big house. She actually did you a favor not making you a BM. You were the one who perpetuated the drama because you were not chosen.  

Take a look in a few months. In hindsight it was a big to-do and you would have been better off not saying anything. 

Now. Not being included sucks and you were treated like shit. There is nothing worse then them all deciding what YOU would be doing without your input. It was a small
Enough wedding tat they could have included everyone in a chat and say “what are we ALL doing for the wedding”. 

Finally. It’s her fucking wedding. Whey the fu k does she NEED everyone? Make your OWN fucking wedding. 

You dodged a bullet."
1124,2020-06-26 02:40:06,hfax6j,"I'm still, the day after having read this update, just shaking my head at how terribly you were treated. Sure, fine, don't have someone in your wedding. Be up front and honest about it. Be up front about things in general, instead of lying and then lying again and then being just a BITCH. 

Glad she lightened you load for you, so you could free up yourself to do other things with people that appreciate you. sucks you had to find out like this though."
1125,2020-06-26 23:44:55,hfax6j,"Wow. After all that, she has the audacity to ask you to pick her toddler up from daycare? I'm so sorry she took you for granted, and I'm glad you have REAL friends because Josie certainly isn't one."
1126,2020-06-24 22:58:06,hfax6j,I have been living for this story. Especially now since we're lockdown and I have NO EXCITEMENT IN MY LIFE.
1127,2020-06-24 23:09:38,hfax6j,"I’m sorry that your friendship didn’t last her wedding. It hurts, but now you know exactly where on the totem pole you stand."
1128,2020-06-24 23:36:04,hfax6j,Hey thanks for replying to me about this update. You’re a real MVP. I’m sorry your once great friendship got turned to sewage.
1129,2020-06-24 23:38:42,hfax6j,"I'm glad you have real friends to grab lunch with and do the girly thing. 
I've found myself with more and more so-called friends like your out of touch bridezilla. I wouldn't even know who to invite for a mani pedi. Time to move on and spend more time with those folks!"
1130,2020-06-25 00:10:46,hfax6j,"Well, you were a real friend. She wasn't.  Isn't.

Thanks for the update.  Been stalking your user page all day."
1131,2020-06-25 00:36:46,hfax6j,So they were expecting you to jump into babysitting? I know you said they told you no one would get stuck because everyone would share but since you don't have a kid doesn't that mean you shouldn't have to babysit?
1132,2020-06-25 00:55:35,hfax6j,Please tell me you work for DAL!
1133,2020-06-25 01:45:58,hfax6j,Question:  Have you actually told them you aren't coming or just cut them out completely?
1134,2020-06-25 02:08:10,hfax6j,I havent read the update yet just wanted to tell you i loved the josie and the pussycats references! (I was into the comics as a kid lol)
1135,2020-06-25 02:13:15,hfax6j,"I am so happy for you right now !!! I'm gonna try to give you an award or some shit hol up. Go get drunk watch a movie , eat some good food and fuck Josie and the other bitches you deserve better. Also of you ever go back to Josie VIRTUAL SLAPS from here

The award probably means nothing but I hope hope you understand that this is the only token of love I could offer you over the internet. Stay strong my girl"
1136,2020-06-25 02:24:56,hfax6j,Such a justice boner ending. I love it!
1137,2020-06-25 02:36:21,hfax6j,"Wow! So sorry for the outcome, but yeah that relationship wasn’t going to last too much longer. I can think of two “friends” that this reminded me of.
I felt relief for you reading how you just let it out and ended things. I think I’m planning on doing the same, life’s too short for putting up with people’s crap."
1138,2020-06-25 02:43:02,hfax6j,"Whoa whoa whoa, where were Alexandra and the BF sleeping?"
1139,2020-06-25 02:43:36,hfax6j,"I hate to say this, but it seems like you were not supposed to be invited in the first place, on purpose. But why would she show you the invite list if she didn't intend on inviting you? unless she's callous or trying to give you a hint or something. Sorry people suck"
1140,2020-06-25 04:39:56,hfax6j,"What a complete asshole! Good riddance to that ""friendship""!

It always infuriates me when someone is considered like a kid or ""less than"" just because they're single. It's rude and disrespectful and seems to me to insinuate that unless someone else has ""claimed"" you, you don't have any integrity and could just be shuffled together with any random person to sleep in the same room. It's often the same deal at work; you're expected to take all uncomfortable hours, do overtime work, etc, because you couldn't *possibly* have anything better to do with your time unless you have a partner and/or kids... 🙄"
1141,2020-06-25 04:51:17,hfax6j,"Thank you for the update.  I am glad you are not going; you probably know you were going to be the childcare (this is why they wanted you to bunk with the kids).  She is not your friend, she is a user of you.  Hang out with your real friends and enjoy your dream job!"
1142,2020-06-25 05:18:55,hfax6j,You shouldn't go even go if she makes you Maid of Honor at this point!!!
1143,2020-06-25 05:34:54,hfax6j,"I’m so glad you got that toxic friend out of your life!! I have a rule where if one of my friends talk sh*t about their other friends to me, but still remains friendly with them, there is no doubt they’re probably doing the same behind my back and I rather not be close to someone like that."
1144,2020-06-25 06:06:56,hfax6j,Lol this whole thing is so bullshit
1145,2020-06-25 06:20:13,hfax6j,"Thanks for updating OP.
I am sorry about the end of your friendship because you seem to really care for her.
You tried so hard to give Josie the benefit of the doubt that I worried you would be unable to see her true colors and be subjected to further pain and injury during the wedding weekend.
Good luck OP. The hurt will lessen and you will be better for it."
1146,2020-06-25 09:00:54,hfax6j,"I just had a bad feeling about Josie, felt like you would get stabbed in the back.. Glad you didn't get stuck with the kiddo at a wedding with the ""handsome"" brother of the groom... that cuz your single you could be with..  Been waiting for the outcome of this...."
1147,2020-06-25 10:44:02,hfax6j,"You need better friends. Fuck those guys. 
You'd definitely be in a better, rockinger girl band, like The Bangles."
1148,2020-06-25 11:47:45,hfax6j,I hope you told her to ask Melody to pick up her toddler before you walked out.
1149,2020-06-25 12:17:20,hfax6j,"I’m sorry you were treated like this. The fact that you weren’t even put on the guest list, proves that your presence at the wedding wasn’t truly important to her. Josie and her Pussycats just wanted to use you as a babysitter for the kids."
1150,2020-06-25 14:19:44,hfax6j,"So, I'm very glad that the update ended up positive and you realized that they were taking advantage of you. BUT for future reference, I do think that thinking of friends as being higher or lower up on the totem pole and then getting mad about it isn't going to be healthy for you. I say this because I've been and probably still am in your shoes. And the moment I see that I am not as high as a priority to someone as they are to me, I make changes. Early on. Or if the behavior doesn't change, I distance myself. The early changes prevent later heartbreak. Because at the end of the day, you may be in the right, but the moment you bring up your questions or reasons for why other people are getting better treatment than you, it may cheapen your character in someone else's eyes. Not everyone has a rational mindset--especially during weddings lol."
1151,2020-06-25 14:34:51,hfax6j,I mean if you still wanna take a vacay and live in the US... flights with Southwest are $39 rn. Trip to miami is under $100 round trip plus staying in a cute little hostel for cheap plus beach and yummy cuban food.  JUST SAYIN.  Just be wary of covid.
1152,2020-06-25 15:13:50,hfax6j,"Thanks for the update! Fuck Josie, what a loser. She'll be realising how much of a dick she was being right about now, now that she only has 'friends' she apparently hates."
1153,2020-06-25 16:26:24,hfax6j,When she called you into her office you should have told her that you were sure one of her closer friends would love to pick up her kid at day care.
1154,2020-06-25 16:31:02,hfax6j,"Damn, I thought the beginning was a bit too happy. And the nerve that she has to ask you to pick up her child after all that is groundbreaking."
1155,2020-06-25 18:17:09,hfax6j,I’m so sorry this was the outcome. I’m glad you found your voice and strength when it came to this “friend”. You deserve better.
1156,2020-06-27 18:06:06,hfax6j,"Yeah my friends were 23 and I was 24. They told me that if I wasnt married by 25 I was too old to get married and wasting my life lol. I wasnt going to get bullied into marriage. I'm now 31, never been married. Don't even know if I believe in marriage. If I do ever get married I'm only doing it once and I'm not getting peer pressured into doing so lol"
1157,2020-06-28 07:28:18,hfax6j,"She did the same crap to you TWICE?? She can’t even pretend to be a good friend. Good for you for sticking up for yourself! If you post more updates, I will read all of them."
1158,2020-06-28 08:48:57,hfax6j,"I'm hoping after all of this, you grew some more self respect for yourself, because even if she did make you a bridesmaid from the start, she didn't have the right to take you for granted. honestly, she seems like the type where her own marriage won't even last a year maybe even a month."
1159,2020-06-24 23:21:22,hfax6j,Well look at that they were thinking of your after all..they got you a man and a job to keep you busy /s :)
1160,2020-06-25 00:30:59,hfax6j,"Not gonna lie, I waited all day to see this update >_>;;;

Fuck Josie and her shitty ass ""Pussycats"". I'm so sorry you've been treated like this, and I'm glad you stood your ground and walked out. She's clearly shown her true colors now and isn't worth the time.

If she was a true friend, she would have been supportive of you when you got your dream job. She wouldn't have forgotten you in the wedding party and then attempted to relegate you to the couch.

Take that $500 you would have spent and treat yourself!"

1164,2020-06-24 22:56:31,hfax6j,"Wow, just WOW. It keeps getting worse."
1165,2020-06-25 03:16:55,hfax6j,"> She said that I left a void in not only her heart but her family’s too. She said Melody really stepped up and was there for her.

Excuse me what the fuck. ""Boo hoo you got a job and are no longer there for *me*!!"" What kind of narcissistic BS is this?! Yes, she absolutely should have been supporting you in your big career move. I know you said before that she was your friend and helped you out in a tough time in your life, but hear me out - I don't think she was ever your friend. I think she felt good and important to be needed (some savior complex shit) and once you weren't around to either need her or give her attention, she moved on to the next.

You don't need friends like that. Good on you for moving on as well.

edit: OK, maybe the idea that she was never your friend is a bit hyperbolic. But this is definitely bringing truth to the claim that people can change. Sounds like she changed in a big way."
1166,2020-06-25 03:25:21,hfax6j,"Ugh, garbage people.  I am sorry that just about everyone in the situation, except you, is being a gigantic twatwaffle."
1167,2020-06-25 04:23:33,hfax6j,OP I say this with love but wtf were you blind and just willfully being a doormat? even last night you let Josie convince and delude yourself into believing her again. Glad you’re finally seeing the light with Alexandria but you were still letting yourself be a doormat after the talk with Josie today despite all the previous red flags.
1168,2020-06-25 07:40:10,hfax6j,"I'm so sorry your ""friend"" treated you like that. At least, you got to see her true colours before you got stuck there, at least 500$ poorer, being miserable for a few days."

1171,2020-06-24 22:32:47,hfax6j,I’ll add more details when I’m done peewooping
1172,2020-06-25 01:26:54,hfax6j,There was a part of me that hoped I’d get there and there was a plane flying a banner apologising to me but she’s a joke.

1175,2020-06-25 00:59:13,hfax6j,"She said that basically the trip initially started off as Josie and Melody planning a “family vacation.” Which somehow morphed into Josie getting married. From there, they only chose immediate family and because Valerie and Josie work together in real estate, Valerie snagged an invite. Valerie helped Josie find the mansion. Which is why I wasn’t originally on the list. At that point everyone was a couple except me and the brother of the groom (who makes a shit ton of money so he’d be fine in a room by himself. 

Apparently they had decided in an effort to keep things cost effective, they were “hoping” I’d be down to watch the girls but by no means, was that my job. 🙄 the girls apparently got their own room because it’s one of Melody’s daughter had a birthday. Also it’s right before school starts so they “deserve” a nice vacation."
1176,2020-06-24 23:57:33,hfax6j,Yes give us all the details haha
1177,2020-06-25 01:08:09,hfax6j,"They kicked the kids out into the living room, gave me the room, then she gave the room away to
Alexandra."
1178,2020-06-25 23:36:06,hfax6j,Holy shit. We should create a wedding trauma page so that we can support each other for these horrible weddings and brides/grooms we’ve had to endure 😂
1179,2020-06-25 06:41:16,hfax6j,I certainly hope you didn't actually give all that stuff to her . Please say you trashed it all !
1180,2020-06-25 06:54:29,hfax6j,My partner and I are both fuming on your behalf.
1181,2020-06-26 02:31:11,hfax6j,"I...... just had to pick my jaw up off the floor. 

She got you to do free labor on a planning committee, but you were C squad level for invites?

That's a horrible way to learn how awful someone is. My god I'm so sorry. I saw you said it's been a decade, but that's still just disgusting. I don't understand how people treat others like that."
1182,2020-06-24 22:53:27,hfax6j,Check out the stickied post!
1183,2020-06-24 22:54:06,hfax6j,"Dude, I can’t believe I was willing to pay $500 🙃"
1184,2020-06-24 22:56:16,hfax6j,EX friend without a doubt. She’s not even worth that effort or that thought. I’m gonna live my life completely unbothered.
1185,2020-06-25 01:55:27,hfax6j,Thank you!! I’m glad I don’t have to compete anymore though.
1186,2020-06-25 03:22:46,hfax6j,"The update right now is that she’s blowing my phone up. She offered to make me MOH and to pay for a room to MYSELF, no brother in laws haha."
1187,2020-06-25 02:53:41,hfax6j,>I'd rather be pimped out to the brother than have to pay $500 to look after someone's kids. haha
1188,2020-06-24 22:54:29,hfax6j,It was destined to happen at some point
1189,2020-06-24 22:54:14,hfax6j,Some people have no taste
1190,2020-06-25 11:04:49,hfax6j,Meow🖕 Meow🖕 meow🖕 meow ✌meow✌
1191,2020-06-25 06:55:07,hfax6j,"Wait, that bitch badmouthed your *baby*?"
1192,2020-06-26 02:42:49,hfax6j,"Absolutely. At this point I’m like, live and let learn. I truly truly hope she finds whatever she needs in her life to not be that person."
1193,2020-06-24 22:58:57,hfax6j,"It’s okay, strangers on Reddit were more supportive than my real life friends 😂"
1194,2020-06-25 01:01:36,hfax6j,I don’t typically say who I work for but I’ll tell you that I don’t work for them! I want to though!
1195,2020-06-25 01:48:11,hfax6j,Just cut them out but if they don’t get it at this point then they’re dumber than I thought.
1196,2020-06-25 02:28:45,hfax6j,Thank you!! I was trying to include Captain Caveman.
1197,2020-06-25 02:15:25,hfax6j,"No no no no, don’t spend your money on that. Wait I just That you did. I appreciate the support, I really do. Without you guys being brutally honest with me, I’d be sleeping on a $500 couch"
1198,2020-06-25 03:11:35,hfax6j,"They weren’t gonna come because they moved out of state. She had finally agreed to move the kids onto the couch so I could have a bed. After she RSVP’d though, I she got my bed 🙃"
1199,2020-06-26 05:14:53,hfax6j,"I wondered that, too. If she wasn’t invited, why discuss it at all much less bring paperwork?"
1200,2020-06-25 20:57:01,hfax6j,"I live in South Florida, haha. I’ll go take a day trip"
1201,2020-06-25 00:29:06,hfax6j,"Lmfao. Good news, we wouldn’t have had to fuck in the car after all."
1202,2020-06-25 00:35:49,hfax6j,"I’m literally soooooo shocked by the way she’s acting. Without seeming like I’m making excuses for her, still, this is not the friend I’ve known for years. This is someone totally different and I don’t like her. She spent half the night trash talking Melody, yet, once again, chose her to be her bridesmaid over me, her loyal friend of 6 years."
1203,2020-06-25 00:30:27,hfax6j,"She said I was being a little dramatic. She said it was her big day. Today though, she’s been blowing me up and she offered to make me Maid of Honor. I told her that after the way she’s treated me, I wouldn’t even be a pall bearer at her funeral."
1204,2020-06-25 00:32:39,hfax6j,"That’s barely a step up from sleeping with 10 year olds. I asked her if it was two separate beds at least and she said, it just depends on if you beat the girls there. They may not want to sleep in one big bed. She said we had an air mattress that we could borrow 🙃"
1205,2020-06-25 00:36:29,hfax6j,"Ngl, it took me a hot minute. Had I not seen that facebook post, I’d be sleeping on the $500 couch."
1206,2020-06-25 03:21:00,hfax6j,"It was a tough move, I’m not even gonna lie. I willingly chose to be blind to it because I didn’t want to believe it but the more and more than I replay the friendship, I totally see it. Good riddance, I’m glad I’m not out $500."
1207,2020-06-24 22:37:05,hfax6j,[deleted]
1208,2020-06-24 22:53:44,hfax6j,YOU GO GIRL! this was great. She doesn't deserve you. I was so pissed as if it happened to me. We are so proud of you! The nerve of asking you to pick up her toddler from daycare instead of apologizing. She's an idiot and she deserves her stupid bridesmaids.
1209,2020-06-24 22:44:16,hfax6j,Omg I'm giddy! I bet you feel a huge weight off your shoulders. I'm in awe of your lady balls!
1210,2020-06-28 02:18:02,hfax6j,"I personally think you’re over reacting, I feel like it’s pretty standard that couples get first dibs on the bedrooms, sleeping on a couch isn’t really a big deal. I feel like you are the source of more drama than you realize. Your friends wedding is about her and her partner not your girlfriend troubles."
1211,2020-06-25 05:27:42,hfax6j,"Realizing someone you considered a friend really isn’t *sucks* hard... it’s heartbreaking. But ultimately, this is a great thing - it frees you up to invest in relationships with people who deserve your time and energy and care, because they give you theirs. 

Also, you just seem like a *fabulous* person all around. This is purely Josie’s loss, m’dear, not yours."
1212,2020-06-25 03:13:06,hfax6j,"I don’t get it, was it all about keeping an even number with the groomsmen? I don’t see the point in excluding one person

I also don’t understand her hotel comment, was that her giving them the couch and kicking you out or was that her implying that they would stay in your hotel room?"
1213,2020-06-25 06:49:48,hfax6j,"I thought so. they would see you as a babysitter...   
Next to the 'ruining my wedding'-card they will double down with the 'you ruined my kids birthday' if you refused.  


It's a 2 for 1 combo!  
I was surprised it went down so easy int he first part, but then the party you're not invited to as well?  
I would think that if I excluded my best friend by mistake, I would bring up everything immediately we were going to do and just write you down on those lists as well.  
your friend is quite forgetful, again!"
1214,2020-06-25 08:49:44,hfax6j,"So the real plan was for her to go off on this family vacation and return with the news that Josie got married while on vacation.   You were never considered part of the celebrating.

What you need to do now, is find a fantastic luxury site for your own vacation."
1215,2020-06-25 13:25:43,hfax6j,"That explains a little bit of their behavior although it still does not excuse it. No one communicated this with you nor did they ask you for any input. Was the $500 that you were going to pay a subsidized rate lower than what the others were paying? I’m wondering if you watching the girls would have been a cost savings measure for you or them. 
Even if they were planning on charging you less in exchange for not getting a room and watching over the girls they should have communicated that with you after asking if that’s a subsidy that you needed and were willing to take. If $500 is what everyone else is paying per person (not even accounting for the kids) then that’s even more of a hell naw dawg."
1216,2020-06-25 03:33:54,hfax6j,"So the room with the double beds? If the kids are in the living room, are they going to be sharing the bathroom with whoever has that room? Because that person isn’t going to have any privacy or uninterrupted sleep. 😂"
1217,2020-06-25 01:09:31,hfax6j,Wow. I’m sorry!
1218,2020-06-25 23:47:57,hfax6j,Oh lordy! Im sure we’d have a bunch of unfortunate souls bringing their stories !
1219,2020-06-28 05:09:46,hfax6j,I'm sure they'd love to hear from you over at r/bridezillas or r/weddingshaming 🤣
1220,2020-06-25 12:24:07,hfax6j,Unfortunately it had already been given to her.
1221,2020-06-25 12:24:48,hfax6j,"Aww, shucks. It was almost a decade ago now. I havent spoken to any of them since then"
1222,2020-06-26 04:03:50,hfax6j,"Yeah, I was fucking shocked. It never occurred to me or ever seemed like I wouldn’t be invited. 

It sucked at the time but its okay now. Its a fucked up funny story to me now a days. I don’t understand it either. If she had said from the start (prior to wedding planning and all the work), “scarlet, youre not on the invite list. Sorry.” I wouldve been bummed but said ‘party on dudes and enjoy the honeymoon’. No harm, no foul. But I guess in the end, I was just that naive artist friend she could exploit and the others allowed to happen without saying a word. 

It’s all good though. I dropped that dead weight and I felt a fuckton lighter as a human afterwards."
1223,2020-06-25 00:44:35,hfax6j,"No offense, but you’re insane for that lol. I wouldn’t have accepted even if they paid me $500 to babysit and you were willing to give Josie $500 to babysit her and her friends kids."
1224,2020-06-24 23:11:57,hfax6j,No chance they will pay you to babysit still?
1225,2020-06-25 03:26:31,hfax6j,Too little too late. At least you’ll have a entertaining story to tell people about that crazy bridezilla.
1226,2020-06-25 04:04:16,hfax6j,"Man, she's really desperate for a babysitter, huh.

I'd bet that when you got there the rules would have changed again, or at best, the other women would be giving you the cold shoulder from hell."
1227,2020-06-25 04:06:07,hfax6j,"Sounds to me like someone in the party has bailed...maybe they read this post and are wisely distancing themselves from this trainwreck...and our bride is hoping you can fill the vacancy, under the guise of realizing just how much she neeeds you there."
1228,2020-06-25 04:36:54,hfax6j,"I’m just asking out of curiosity and am not telling you to take the deal, but would that room have been in a hotel or was she going to find another mansion with the extra room?  Like everyone else your story has been my entertainment for the past couple of days now that I’ve already watched everything on Netflix lol."
1229,2020-06-25 13:05:34,hfax6j,Curious where exactly she is conjuring this room from all of the sudden?
1230,2020-06-26 10:47:37,hfax6j,"That sounds like an offer which would change the moment you accepted it.  

&#x200B;

At the end of the day, her friends achieved their goal - replacing you with themselves, pushing you out of the friends circle and she let it happen.  She had every opportunity to intervene, bit late to be offering you the MOH role now, that's just the guilt talking and an attempt to make herself feel better, not you."
1231,2020-06-25 07:03:43,hfax6j,"Yeah so our other friend L got into it eith my boyfriend (I was mad at my boyfriend for what he said and defended her, but L said I was guilty by association) so she told Sam to choose between us being bridesmaids. Sam had her be in the bridal party. Fast forward a bit and all 3 of us have kids. L had her daughter on my sons first birthday and Sam was talking shit about my kids dad (we were broken up by this point) and she said ""I guess I'll never go to your sons birthday"". She simultaneously put the drama of shit my baby daddy said years before my son being born and admitted she would forever exclude him because some other bitch had a baby on his birthday. That was it for me.

Sam was just one of those friends who took everything she could from me and then once her life wasn't in dire straits treated me like shit."
1232,2020-06-24 22:59:48,hfax6j,They weren't your real friends. Real friends don't pull that bullshit.
1233,2020-06-25 02:55:55,hfax6j,"DAL is the airline in animal crossing new horizon for the switch, Dodo airlines, I think op meant to make a funny"
1234,2020-06-25 02:17:03,hfax6j,"I actually never spend a dime on this I think a strange had given me an award quite some time and it made my day , and it's my turn to pass it someone deserving"
1235,2020-06-25 03:13:34,hfax6j,You are done with this chick I hope.
1236,2020-06-25 20:57:55,hfax6j,Well dang you can probably catch flights else where for cheap too. 😂
1237,2020-06-25 01:02:52,hfax6j,"Just saw the single brother is rich, you should invite him out with you instead that weekend."
1238,2020-06-25 02:07:20,hfax6j,"I feel like I’ve known Josie. The part where you spent the whole night with her, felt really close & all was right again & then the next day you find out there’s a thing planned without you - I’ve been there! It’s shocking to the core that someone can be that callous. You have to protect yourself from people like this, they will literally use & abuse you."
1239,2020-06-25 02:19:51,hfax6j,Bet you she trash talks you to Melody!
1240,2020-06-25 02:01:45,hfax6j,"If this is a side she's showing then this is who she really is, you just haven't seen that side before.

I'm all for trying to salvage friendships and I also believe that planning a wedding is one of the most stressful things you can do - but there's no excuse for how she treated you and you may be better off just walking away from that friendship.  It looks as though it's gotten progressively one sided."
1241,2020-06-25 02:43:15,hfax6j,"Let me just say, I had a friend like Josie and it took nine years to realize she actually wasn’t my friend but just liked the attention I gave her. Because when I got a boyfriend and a better paying job she was quick to recast me as her best friend. And if Josie is trash talking about a friend to you, she sure as hell is trash talking about you to another friend."
1242,2020-06-25 07:28:28,hfax6j,"I was a bridesmaid to a Josie. It was a more traditional wedding but we had been childhood friends, though we lost touch after we both went off to college. I thought it would be a good chance to reconnect. She talked trash about everyone behind their backs to everyone else, was very controlling, and asked us to put in sooo much help. I spent two hours making a playlist for the DJ, because that was apparently my job according to her, and she didn't even use it. Trust me, as someone who had a mental breakdown the night before the wedding and only ended up going because my sister (who had offered some advice since she's planned her own wedding, and had instead been roped into being a free wedding coordinator) said please show up and just grin and bear it so that my sister didnt have to put up with a hysteric bride.

The wedding itself turned out okay, despite me and another bridesmaid not having our hair and makeup done by the time they wanted to do pictures, despite this girl insisting we couldn't do our own and all had to pay for one makeup artist to do all four of our hair and makeup, in addition to the bride, within five hours (which I told her would not be possible, several times).

They were divorced within a year. Am I salty? Yes.

Trust me. I'm sure it sucks, but it's better to find out the situation you're getting into upfront, rather than continuing to make excuses for her until you realize she's a horrible friend right after you've spent all the money and right before the actual event."
1243,2020-06-25 00:42:05,hfax6j,Who needs all that drama!!?
1244,2020-06-25 00:53:03,hfax6j,damn sick burn I’m 100% going to use that pall bearer line
1245,2020-06-25 04:16:17,hfax6j,You better get her some cream for that burn girl.
1246,2020-06-25 03:03:10,hfax6j,DAMN GIRL. You told her!! I recently had to end a long friendship & honestly I'm better off. You are too. Something about weddings really shows who ppl are. I'm so proud of you for putting your foot down!
1247,2020-06-25 00:48:24,hfax6j,"Oh believe me it was sarcasm. I'd be personally pretty uncomfortable being expected to sleep in the same bed as a guy I don't know/barely know on what amounts to a mixed-sex wedding do. It comes a little too close to almost pimping you out, to me, but maybe I'm too prudish!"
1248,2020-06-25 00:41:24,hfax6j,"You wanted to believe the best in her, and you gave her the chance. I would have probably done the same thing. 

One Facebook post saved you $500- pretty awesome"
1249,2020-06-25 07:41:01,hfax6j,Girl take that $500 bucks and go do something fun for you. Pamper yourself and then splash it all over social media. Don’t let this keep you down your better then all of them.
1250,2020-06-24 22:46:04,hfax6j,"It was hard but tbh, so necessary. She blames our rift in the fact that we’re at two different points in our life. I had just started my career and was super busy and “wasn’t there for her.” I told that bitch she should have been happy that I landed my dream job."
1251,2020-06-24 23:34:52,hfax6j,"Other subs have seen allowing shit like this turn into epics, where posters intentionally drag out drama for karma, likes etc.   I would see “update 12” type comments. 

Honestly I was starting to get that feeling with OP. I use the OPs comment history to find their posts and there was a block where she seemed to have the time to post a bunch of comments saying she’ll post an update but ...just didn’t post the update. It felt off to me. Then to come on here to see her comment about it being a throwaway for “extra curriculars”....I was wary of this being marketing. 

OP does generally seem on the up and up, it’s just this posting pattern can lead to problems for admins."
1252,2020-06-24 22:55:42,hfax6j,I really still walked into her office with an ounce of hope that she was going to make it better 😂
1253,2020-06-24 22:53:02,hfax6j,Check out my stickied post
1254,2020-06-28 03:11:13,hfax6j,"So you think it’s acceptable to pay $500 to sleep on a couch and share a bathroom with tweens, while your friends who are couples share king sized beds with en-suite bathrooms? I’m actually not being sarcastic?"
1255,2020-06-25 03:18:10,hfax6j,"She claims it was to each the wedding party even because the groom only wanted three groomsmen but Alexandra is walking with her boyfriend so there goes that excuse. 

The hotel comment was my lovely “friend” kicking me out the mansion so her other friend could have a room."
1256,2020-06-25 09:34:18,hfax6j,"This is 100% what her plan was. At that point, what was her point in even telling me about it."
1257,2020-06-25 23:33:25,hfax6j,Apparently $500 is the per couple price. Which maybe I’m wrong but why would I pay a “per couple” price for a single person? 🤔
1258,2020-06-25 03:37:55,hfax6j,"No lmfao, all the rooms have en-suite and then there’s one extra “public” bathroom so the girls would have their own. I would have had to share because if I was on the couch, I’m sure the other girls would have use the spare while the one in their room was in use."
1259,2020-06-25 01:18:03,hfax6j,It’s okay cause I was gonna stay in a hotel anyway /s
1260,2020-06-27 00:16:35,hfax6j,You had already given her everything??? I'd have sent her an invoice. Taken it back. I can't believe this sh**
1261,2020-06-25 01:02:32,hfax6j,"I know, I’m a stupid ass sucker but don’t worry, I wisened up"
1262,2020-06-24 23:12:35,hfax6j,They were NEVER going to pay me to babysit. I was paying them to be the sitter
1263,2020-06-25 23:34:50,hfax6j,I assume it would have been for a hotel at this point. She didn’t specify and I didn’t ask. Lmfao. She would have had to kick Alexandra and her boyfriend out of a room otherwise
1264,2020-06-25 23:35:11,hfax6j,I assume a hotel
1265,2020-06-25 07:49:51,hfax6j,YIKES.
1266,2020-06-26 02:36:05,hfax6j,"Incredibly happy that chapter of your life is over for you, and she's no longer around to use you. Yikes, how terrible of her."
1267,2020-06-24 23:01:01,hfax6j,Idk if you read my stickied comment but apparently it’s my fault for starting my career
1268,2020-06-25 03:05:13,hfax6j,Lmfaooooo that’s Delta’s call sign. Total r/wooosh
1269,2020-06-25 03:19:03,hfax6j,"100% without a doubt. Fool me one time, shame on you. Fool me two times, can’t put blame on you."
1270,2020-06-25 23:26:51,hfax6j,Lmfaooooo the only thing cute about him is his wallet
1271,2020-06-25 02:27:47,hfax6j,"Oh yeah dude. After she called me to her office, she nailed the nails into the coffin"
1272,2020-06-26 04:53:19,hfax6j,"I definitely had a Josie in my life. In retrospect, the signs were always there. It just took awhile for the pendulum to swing in my direction."
1273,2020-06-25 06:37:31,hfax6j,Bingo. People who talk trash with you talk trash *about* you.
1274,2020-06-25 23:26:17,hfax6j,I never realised just how much resentment she has towards me for getting my dream job. I’m the type of person who’s happy when my friends are successful and happy.
1275,2020-06-25 15:20:41,hfax6j,My best friend was in that wedding.  Her Josie and her haven't spoken in years.  Josie never even ended up posting the wedding photos she was so worried about because he moved out before they ever got them back.
1276,2020-06-25 23:25:21,hfax6j,"You know, that’s the part I don’t understand. Why do people keep friends that they constantly talk trash about. I’m genuinely happy and supportive of all my friends. If my friend finds $100 bucks, I’m GENUINELY happy that she found that money. I’m not angry or salty or keeping score. 

You’re honestly a trooper for showing up."
1277,2020-06-25 01:03:23,hfax6j,"Not me, I’ll tell you what"

That said, historical use of blackface by someone like Kimmel should absolutely NOT be condemned.  If it happened years ago, we have the benefit of being familiar with Kimmel's entire body of work since then and his history as a public figure.

But I don't get there by pretending it is already healed and forgoing medical attention and proper care of it during the healing process.

>How does ensuring it can't be used in any form against a particular group and labeling everyone who does so as guilty of a hate crime (in the social sense, not legal sense) while it can be done to the other group (white face I suppose it would be could) be progressing?

Personally I feel that both are inherently in bad taste, but the reason they are treated so differently is because the history behind them is so different.

Also, there is the difference between ""punching down"" and ""punching up."" Generally it has always been acceptable for disadvantaged and minority groups to ""punch up"" and deride groups in power. The opposite, where groups in power ""punch down"" and derive disadvantaged and minority groups is seen as bullying.

>However I don't think the solution to that is to label any form of black face as a call out or nostolgic of that version of it.

>  
>So why am I wrong about this?

The act has acquired, through use, the meaning of being racist. And while you are correct that people can partake of that act without meaning to be racist, this does not negate the fact that it has racist underpinnings and has acquired racist meanings.

Yes, we can ignore that and simply pretend that its racist meaning doesn't exist, but that is simply ignoring history and ignoring present-day problems. While, possibly, over time it may lose this association, we are not at that point yet.

So what of the people that have ""innocently"" done it? We should be very skeptical of these claims because it would be hard to tell people who are truly doing it ""innocently"" and people who aren't but are pretending to be innocent. It strains belief that a person today could engage in the act and be unaware of its history or implications.

But even if the act is done innocently, an innocent insult is still an insult, an innocent mistake is still a mistake. And while that may qualify the degree to which they are reprimanded, they still need to be made aware of their mistake as to not repeat it."

I’m black and It’s getting hard to even care about racial issues today bc the conversation and terms of engagement is completely dominated by the far left. Which sucks bc the vast majority of the loudest mouthpieces with the highest platforms are just objectively wrong on every issue that matters in the “community”. 

But this isn’t one of those debatable issues honestly. At best I’ll say “Sure go ahead, but I wouldn’t do that if I were you” From my own subjective experience it is mad uncomfortable being around someone in blackface. 

I’m a live and let live kind of guy, but seeing it and being around it is a weird combination of embarrassment on behalf of all parties involved and internal infuriation that I don’t necessarily understand myself, I just understand that I have to step away from the situation and everyone out there in the world simply can’t.

1331,2020-06-24 17:48:54,hexd0t,"I don't watch Kimmel, so I don't know how he changes his appearance in skits.

So I ask - does he use wigs or dyes when he plays white people with a different hair color?  Does he change his skin color to be lighter if he plays a Caucasian with very white skin.  Does he use colored contact lenses to change his eye color?"
1332,2020-06-24 20:45:56,hexd0t,I think if you were talking about Ben Shapiro doing black face as opposed to Jimmy Kimmel you would have a completely different view and you're being disingenuous.
1333,2020-06-24 09:08:56,hexd0t,"I mean, I would argue that if you can't successfully imitate a black celebrity without painting your face black, maybe you're not a very good impressionist - and the same would be true about having to wear a wig to do an impression of a white celebrity. And watching the clips, I suspect that's true. Kimmel's Oprah sketches for example just seem like terrible impressions to me, and if it weren't for the blackface I don't think you'd know he was trying to imitate her.  

I think black face probably is inherently a bit racist. Not like, totally racist, but definitely a bit. At the same time though, that's kind of the whole point. Like, take the blackface scene in The Office or Community. These scenes are taking the piss out of people who are a bit racist. 

It's also a matter of context - what is and isn't racist changes based on culture, because it's about intent. If you used blackface today, it would be inherently racist because everyone knows that it's really unacceptable to do it. 20 years ago however maybe that wasn't the case (although I suspect it probably was, given that blackface has been used throughout history with pretty much exclusively racist intent). It's the same as how if you were to say the n word a thousand years ago it wouldn't be a big deal, but it definitely is now because hundreds of years of history has occurred to make that word a big deal. And who knows, maybe in future it will stop being racist again?"
1334,2020-06-24 08:36:41,hexd0t,"I agree with you that it isn’t inherently racist. However, we live in a world where blackface has a long history of racism meaning a lot of people take it as racist.

1338,2020-06-26 18:03:09,hexd0t,"I think the best way for me to answer this is by referring to the swastika.
The swastika is perhaps the most reviled symbol in the western world, because of its historical context.

However it also exists in another context, that of some eastern religions, Jainism, Hinduism, Buddhism. In these it it's a wholly positive symbol.

My point being, that just because a thing has a context of historical atrocities. It does not mean that every iteration of that thing must be a reflection of that context, it could be reference to another pre existing context (e.g my swastika religious affiliation example) or a newly developed context (this could be such thing as an attempt to use it in comedy for example)"

This line of thought, I don't think it holds as a good argument.
So for example, a majority of Saudi Arabian citizens find the legal freedoms afforded to LGBT individuals to be deeply offensive. 

So we know this upsets them, and we do it regardless.

Don't get me wrong, I am not conflating LGBT rights with blackface. The former is a historical fight for human rights, the other was historically used to mock the oppressed and is only innocently used as light forms of entertainment, imitation or admiration. 

I am simply using it to display the flawed logic of your argument. 

My response to your argument however, I think would currently be 3 pronged 

1. Simply, just because a group claims offense at a thing, that is not reason enough to capitulate. 

2. We should all have the freedom to do unnecessary things and doing a thing like black face, just because it is unnecessary, that does not mean it is racist. 

3. I don't buy the argument the blackface actually has a tangible negatively effect on people these days, minus, of course, for the fact that someone sees it and says ""I don't like it"" which isn't really an effect worth caring about, I don't like many things, many personally offensive things also. It does me no use to illuminate those things from the world."

Why spend time considering about what someone meant by it when it can be avoided entirely?  I could understand the argument *for* using it if it were something more commonplace, but it isn't.  It isn't as though someone is suddenly saying that driving around with my window down or wearing certain colors of clothing is racist.  I've managed to live this long without painting my face black and I'm sure the rest of my life will go just fine without it.  There just really isn't a great reason for it. If it has a time and a place, such as a theater production or something similar, that's a different story.  But for regular people, it's easy and best to just avoid it."
1362,2020-06-24 09:20:43,hexd0t,"That's basically what I said.  No racist intent has been found in those particular (Kimmel and RDJ) instances of blackface, so treating them as racist is wrong.  Kimmel and RDJ aren't racists.  BUT, they can easily refrain from ever doing it again and we'll all be ok.  They don't get a ""non racist"" pass forever.  It sounds bad because I don't believe they'll turn racist at any point, but to designate some people as known non-racists while others aren't is in itself a form of racism.  So why not just not do blackface anymore?"

Take the swastikas it is perceived by many as hateful and racist because of its historical use and context.
But for roughly over a billion people it is a symbol of divinity and spirituality.

They are aware that they live in a world where people perceive it as insulting and offensive, they do it anyway and they are not being malicious or stupid. It means something different to them, in that case it has spiritual meaning.
In this case it could have harmless comical meaning or a meaning in admiration."

Kimmel did this like 20 years ago and people are looking at it pissed off today. If Kimmel did the same sketch but didn’t use black make up - would that be ok?

The problem is this cancel culture. The people, who only get joy in life, of going back through shit in the past to purposely cause harm and look to be offended."

1376,2020-06-24 09:33:41,hexd0t,"That is sort of a self actualising prophecy though, a circular argument.

Some people find black face to be racist, therefore I won't do black face because some people find it to be racist. 

I agree the only situations I can imagine black face sensibly occuring are those of performance or imitation (wether that be for comedy or something like Halloween, dressing up as black panther for example.)

I have never done it, and do not feel the need to, but I also don't see the issue with a kid dressing up as black panther (without the mask obviously) in Halloween. 

I think the main point I would like to address though is this.

>There just really isn't a great reason for it.

Perhaps not, but simply because it isn't necessary, that doesn't make someone doing it racist.

Although it's history is an interesting curiosity, we can no longer draw a meaningful connection between the original (by modern standards) offensive blackface, and the modern hypothetically non-offensive blackface, therefore it is now ok to do blackface if your intention is not to cause unjustified offense."""

I understand what you're saying and I agree with you.  Unfortunately, we're not just talking about some random thing with no history.  Wearing brown shoes, as far as I'm aware, has no history of being used in a racist way.  So, if a movement started today that declared the wearing of brown shoes to be racist, I'd reject that idea.  It wouldn't be *necessary* for me to wear brown shoes anymore because I do own other shoes, but I would wear them anyway because the supposed racist past of brown shoes would be entirely fabricated and I wouldn't accept that.  That isn't what we're dealing with when blackface is concerned.  It has a racist past and it isn't something was otherwise benign until someone decided it wasn't."
1385,2020-06-24 09:45:38,hexd0t,"You aren't getting what I'm saying.

Jimmy Kimmel and Robert Downey Jr ARE NOT RACIST.  Their past use of blackface IS NOT RACIST.  How much more clear about that can I be?

Does whiteface have a history of being used in a manner that portrays white people in terrible ways?  If so, then no one should be able to use it.  I'm not aware of that being the case though."

Logically your argument is also false, by the way. We do not decide our current sensitivities based on our current sensitivities; unless you believe that society is incapable of gradual change."
1396,2020-06-24 09:38:48,hexd0t,"And yet, the dilemma - you can’t please everyone. There will always be people who get offended or pissed off that some one does something that they don’t like. So that’s not a good reason to not do something.

Yes, ""things happened"" in history.  In the case of blackface, as I have already pointed out to you, those ""things"" were horribly discriminatory and were done while an entire group of Americans were systematically dealt with as though they were a burden on the entire country.  That's a bit more than ""things happened"", don't you think?  No, you don't, because you're determined not to, but a reasonable person would understand what I'm saying.

The portrayal of Hitler and Nazis is an entirely different matter.  First, and I can't believe I need to point this out as well, they were the oppressors.  Show me a film that glorifies their role in society and I'm sure you'll also find that it came with it's fair share of extremely valid criticism.  Only racists get pissed off when Hitler and Nazis are portrayed because they're ~~generally~~ always portrayed in a negative or critical way.  Auschwitz is yet another entirely different matter.  Leaving it intact DOES serve as a reminder of the horrors of the past.  Have you been?  I have, and to say it's a moving experience doesn't do it justice.  If blackface were to be used today, it would absolutely NOT be in a manner that would invoke the horrors of what black people endured for centuries under slavery and Jim Crow.  I have already said that the use of blackface under extremely limited and controlled circumstances for theater productions and the like is acceptable, but for regular people like you and I to decide to ""dress up"" as a black person for Halloween is not."
1398,2020-06-24 10:03:51,hexd0t,"> I was asking whether them playing the characters were.

***NO***

I'm baffled that you still don't know the answer to that question.

My answer to your question about whiteface was very clear.  White people painted their faces black as a way to make fun of black people for 100+ years.  Until we have the same record of black people painting their faces white for purposes of making fun of white people (while also systematically oppressing white people for generations), the same comparison simply cannot be made.

Was every use of blackface racist?  No.  Did racists ruin the practice for non-racists?  Yes they did."

However, consider this, in college, a privileged male did not have enough foresight or knowledge to know the effects of black face. To some degree, this is not just an accident or a mistake. This is a deliberate action with serious implications. Racism or racist rhetoric is not a mistake or an accident. 

Also, it can be easily understood, from the perspective of the offended party, that an individual within a position of power that displayed that behavior should be removed immediately. As a minority, ( Puerto Rican) I don’t believe I would feel comfortable with a leader that engaged in that behavior during any portion of their life."

I somewhat agree, but I would argue that the spectrum of what can be considered truly racist behavior has changed recently.  Going back through a person's history and judging them for their past actions according to today's new standards is just wrong.  I went to college in the deep south in the early 90s.  I witnessed A LOT of very racist things.  For instance, there was never a Halloween party where someone wasn't ""dressed up"" as a (now) wildly inappropriate caricature of a black person or even where a master/slave costume combination couldn't be found.  Some had a somewhat less offensive theme (for instance, the couple would be ""portraying"" Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings, not just nameless or generic slaves and slave owners), but it was always there.  I never saw those people display any racist attitudes in a way that would be harmful or judgemental towards anyone at that time.  Some of them are now CEOs, fathers, pastors, inmates, or even dead...but none of them treated anyone differently because of the color of their skin as far as I knew.  They should never be excused for doing those things in college because it was wrong, even then - but the condemnation should stop well before it threatens their livelihood 30 years later.

As far as how you would feel being around a leader who had done those things in their lives, until recently when modern technology has made it possible to dig these things up on the internet, you probably would have never known about that part of their lives.  Your impression of that person would be informed, as it should be, by how they acted around you *today*, not how they acted in college."

I am still not too convinced on how “effective” it is to separate a “leader” who partakes in such behavior, despite it being in the past. As historically speaking, the systemic racism and discrimination was deliberate and should an individual plan on furthering that narrative through whatever medium an offending party seems offensive ( within logical reason) should not be faulted simply as a “mistake.” As these “mistakes” often cause cause irreparable damages to lives or even social conscious. A sorry, or an absence of knowledge ( especially to those with access to it) should not be a “free pass.” 

Of course this is all relegated to my opinion. Although, I do acknowledge that a person can no longer associate with the ideological perspective of their youth. However, just because it was accepted as “normal”’or “standard” during a particular time period doesn’t negate its effect. This is where personal opinion relies heavy on - damages, intent, conclusion, preference, values and ultimately differences in lived and time periods. However I respectfully say that there is no right or wrong answer, just a difference of opinion. I thank you for your time and your thought provoking responses.

I want that rest too.  Not gonna happen.  So...

Just bought a quarter Kilo of pure caffeine.  I need to get more healthy, make good, appropriately dosed drinks, no corn sugar, no crap.

The toxic crap is gone!  No coffee, energy drinks, etc...  pop.  Too much, too toxic.

Got a blender so I can make good stuff.  Keep moving without all the increasingly nasty shit.

Also, cheap ass so long as I play by the rules and do it right.  We are starting to take every dime out of our month we can.  Something is gonna give and I can't have it be us!

One quarter of us are out of work now.  It may hit a third, may not, depends on the reopening and how much carnage people will put up with.

Case spikes for most of the nation, and a big one in formerly quiet Oregon.

I think it's protestors and general business starting up too quick, too sloppy, but there isn't too much data yet.  We just know there are a lot of cases.

Warmer times help right now.  When Oregon gets rainy, look out!

Yeah, it is terrifying.  I would not have gone, but it's a keep it open and get paid kind of deal.  Not happy.

But, it's also where I got sick, and since that time, they've adopted a lot of the safety.  Whatever immunity I may have is likely best aligned with the crud there, so...  yeah.  Not fucking happy.

Not sure what to do.  I can say no.  A few dozen people may be out of work when I do that, followed by me a month or two after doing that.

So, what I am doing is basically demanding we do every last bloody thing remote.  I can keep it all to a minimum.

They did fly me first class, ""we are sorry"" style!  So, that's spiffy.  But, First Class, roomy and comfy seats aside, sucks now.  Basically, you get your treat baggie first, and that's it.  And I skip the food baggie anyway.

This should not be allowed in the community. 

If somebody is being rude or unfriendly, they can be reported because that breaks rule 1 of the subreddit. The mod team seems to be on top of checking these reports. I've personally seen unfriendliness I've reported get removed and a different one not get removed but a public warning by the mods. I am in total agreement that rudeness has no place here, **especially towards beginners.**

>Do we as a community dictate what we want this community to be? Or do we get dictated to, what this community is? 

I'm a part of this community, and I don't like seeing memes or jokes. There's a reason I'm not subscribed to AnarchyChess. Every meme that gets removed from this subreddit is the mod team representing my interests.

> the sixth result comes [r/AnarchyChess](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnarchyChess/), with no description. 

Sounds like the AnarchyChess mods should do something about that if they care.

> It seems reasonable that an unknowing person would expect that a meme about chess would be best suited to post here. If memes are banned here, they are still going to get posted. They will just get deleted, putting a distaste in the mouth of the person who thought that the chess subreddit was for “everything to do with chess”. 

It seems reasonable to me that whenever you join a new subreddit you read the subreddit's rules before posting anything. Rule 3 not only tells people that Memes and Jokes aren't allowed, but also directs them to a subreddit where they are allowed.

**Now, all of that aside, I do agree that I don't like the image of chess and chess players.** I don't like that people think you have to be smart to play chess, or that being bad at chess makes you dumb. I think that these ideas are hurtful to the entire chess community. I don't know what to do about them other than to remind people whenever I see these ideas pop up that they're not true. **I've never considered memes** to be a way to help change this aspect of the chess community, but **I'd be willing to try,** even though I personally really don't care for memes and it's not what I'm here for."

1513,2020-06-23 20:57:27,heewyu,"Please read this. I'm not even arguing with you, but people are complex and messy. I laugh at these episodes, and so does this guy. And I experienced the visual slap in the face that really woke me up to the casual racism that has been tolerated for so long. I don't think the story Kenneth told about the history of the Amos/Abner show would have been as effective without that visual. Race, class, gender politics, teachers sleeping with their students...so many issues this show dealt with, and it was all in-your-face comedy with no apologies.

1514,2020-06-23 18:59:11,heewyu,"I think it depends on the context. 30 Rock was making fun of the characters wearing it and not black people. Defending blackface isn't a hill I want to die on, but I do think it's concerning that full episodes of tv are being completely removed, like they never existed because of a mildly offensive joke? And people tried to cancel gone with the wind too, what's next? I honestly don't think any black person's life will be any better by getting rid of art that has something offensive in it. What people like Tina should do is reflect on this in their next script and improve, think of higher quality jokes than just easy racial ones, and hire more black people"

1526,2020-06-23 10:35:34,hebetl,"Same. Weed helps my PTSD and ADHD massively. It feels like it slows down my brain too, makes me think about stuff / my past in a way I hadn't considered before. Helps my appetite, helps me sleep... I can sometimes feel groggy and I treat a fine line between it helping and using it as a crutch... But to be honest if its helping you I say keep looking after yourself! :)"
1527,2020-06-23 10:39:03,hebetl,"I use it to kill my dreams, I have epilepsy and if I have a fit when I'm asleep it confuses dream with reality and fucks with my head. It helps with some of the medication side effects like no appetite, sleeping like shit etc. It evens my mood through the day instead of flipping between hyper and wanting to end myself every hour. I have had some great times with my dad smoking a spliff and watching the ISS of a night time though."
1528,2020-06-23 10:50:23,hebetl,"I have very severe anxiety and depression, on top of seizures, doctor is very certain it's due to brain damage due to an illness causing a traumatic brain injury, it doesn't take away the depression or anxiety but makes it easier to cope with.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I get a lot of night seizures and as dannydrama said, it helps with the dream weirdness there, and also helps when I have them awake, there has been instances where I have been getting the preseizurey symptoms when awake and a joint just stops it dead, where normally I would be getting on my bed or lying down on the floor to not hurt myself when I drop.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Also insomnia, I haven't been able to get anything for the past couple of months, I'm a chronic insomnia sufferer, the past few weeks I have been getting 4 hours a night if I'm lucky, a spliff before bed for me is an absolute guarantee of a good, restful nights sleep.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'm a broken mess but weed makes things easier"
1529,2020-06-23 12:13:56,hebetl,"Same.

I’d elaborate, but I’m having a down day and I’ve been dankrupt for a couple of weeks.

1530,2020-06-23 10:55:17,hebetl,"I have bipolar disorder and weed has helped lift my mood  short term during depressive episodes. But it's never been a proper fix. For that I need pharma.

Also worth noting, though - studies show that for bipolar disorder, weed can increase the frequency of both depressive and hypomanic/manic episodes. Therefore I am specifically *not* recommending it as a  treatment for others."
1531,2020-06-23 11:50:26,hebetl,"I’m the exact same, I think the key thing with weed is it affects everyone completely different. From my perspective, where you said it enables you to process emotions and stressful situations better is a perfect summary for myself. I feel after smoking I will see problems/ tasks from the correct perspective. Where as before smoking/ being sober I’m typically more negative, and would rather avoid anything problematic rather than get stuck into it."
1532,2020-06-23 13:18:06,hebetl,"It’s whatever works for people, I gave up weed for 8 months and recently I was so fed up with the shit doctors kept prescribing ( sleeping tablets due to intense tinnitus) I started again. Finally getting a decent amount of sleep again. Thanks also for the lol laugh when I read the bit about being a clumsy cunt"
1533,2020-06-24 00:40:10,hebetl,"It seems like it certainly helps more than it harms, i’m on fluoxetine now (prozac) after trying everything else (not the heavy shit like diazepam). It’s like the tablets and the weed works in perfect harmony. I didn’t mention that i’ve got mixed adhd and ocd (i’m a fuckin mixed bag of goods) and it’s crazy to think that it’s not at least been decriminalised in the uk so we can better test it for it therapeutic properties!"
1534,2020-06-23 11:23:20,hebetl,"I get those weird moments as well, but the weed won't do anything for that once it starts. Like you said, it's a case of laying on your bed until it passes but for me that's still no guarantee. I have the depression and anxiety also, much worse since I was diagnosed and I'm sure it's the medication. I had 4 yesterday, every fucking time I fell asleep after none for weeks but at least I still have all of my tongue!"
1535,2020-06-23 14:17:53,hebetl,"My seizures are atonal, I don't always get the warning signs, more often I don't in all honesty, but when one hits it's like someone has hit my off switch, I just drop, and it's clusters as well, anywhere between 5-12 normally, I fucking hate it"
1536,2020-06-23 14:32:29,hebetl,"Yeah mine are often clusters, I had 4/5 saturday, every fucking time I tried taking a nap because I'd had one the night before. I still have no idea what sets it off, if anything in particular. I have a couple of different types I think, some drop me like a rock, left hemisphere of brain goes batshit and others I'm mostly conscious and feeling like I'm dying."

1539,2020-06-23 07:30:00,he8wrw,The thing that's notable about the names is which are circled. The man that stole the black book said that the circled names were the people who were most involved with Epstein's web.  What's interesting is that Clinton is not circled but Trump is.

Not only are the photos creepy AF, look at all the comments. Lots of people have watched the doc Pedogate and the video from Isaac Kappy outing them."
1542,2020-06-23 06:23:24,he8wrw,I don’t know it’s been a while since I looked through it. I think those names are actually in the flight logs not his phone/address book.

While the rate of past childhood abuse is higher among perpetrators than in the general public, 9 out of 10 male victims of abuse do *not* grow up to abuse others. The rate of female perpetrators has not been studied as thoroughly, as there is a much smaller pool of female perps to study. But it would appear that the percentage there of non-abusers is even larger. 

I notice though that you specify in ""the celebrity world."" And I don't have a whole lot to counter that conclusion, because that is a conclusion made from very little if any evidence and a whole lot of theorizing that borders on sheer fantasy."

1568,2020-06-30 15:10:25,hinjss,"Landing all three of them is cool and shit, but if we're wishing for hypotheticals, I'd rather DRose not gotten hurt. If Derrick not gotten hurt, then we would've been a top 2 team in the east, and that's not yet taking into consideration what Jimmy would evolve into. Heck, if Melo signed with us in 14 then I'm sure we could've gotten to the Finals at least that year.

TL;DR: Fuck the Heat"
1569,2020-06-30 13:49:20,hinjss,"Add this to the Noah-LeBron lore.

On another note, the front office dysfunction is painful to read. The Heat look like professionals while the Bulls look like the JV squad."
1570,2020-06-30 15:44:41,hinjss,Bulls FO riding in taxis just makes too much sense
1571,2020-06-30 16:22:26,hinjss,"Don't forget, even with all of that if we would have laid our a solid plan to land all 3.  Which we could if we tried harder to move Deng, we would have got them all.  Our FO royally fucked this up.

Despite that though, I'm not too upset.  Always felt like a cheating way to win a ring.  The rings would have felt empty.  As I think they are on the Heat.  

If only Rose would have never hurt his knee....if only."
1572,2020-06-30 13:57:29,hinjss,"Article also says that Windhorst thinks if Rose was more active during the recruiting process and the Bulls were able to trade Deng, they probably would’ve landed all three of them"

First in the whole LeBron-Bosh ordeal, and then later when he signed with us, there were those talks of bringing in more stars for that Wade-Butler-Rondo combo that I was 100% on board for. 

We screwed the pooch, twice."
1576,2020-06-30 14:28:28,hinjss,"Windhorst is fabricating bullshit.


After the Celtics eliminated the Cavs, LeBron told D.Rose he liked his team. LeBron wants to play here. Adding three stars to Chicago is a no brainer. Because teams will absorb Deng, if you attach two unprotected picks.


Bottom line is, D.Rose doesn’t agree of this. Kid is competitive AF!


This is backed up by him saying, if they want to come here they will come.


You don’t to be a rocket scientist to figure that out. Especially with LeBron saying, “he likes your team.”


I don’t have a problem with them not coming here. I just feel bad D.Rose got injured."
1577,2020-07-01 01:30:27,hinjss,I'm praying that the bulls shedding the old FO will help bring FAs back here. This new FO needs to prove themselves immediately.

1580,2020-06-30 16:20:06,hinjss,I hope Jo plays significant minutes with the Clippers and he finally feels what it’s like to beat LeBron in the postseason.
1581,2020-06-30 14:01:01,hinjss,"Yeah, I texted this to my friend and asked ""Which team would you choose? The one 45 minutes early with experience, rings, and a detailed plan, or the one who forgot to call a ride and messed up the instructions for arrival""

Riley is a hell of a salesman. The thing he did with Bosh, giving him a 2006 ring at their meeting, is genius."
1582,2020-07-02 01:41:49,hinjss,And then getting locked out because they can't follow directions. What a fucking clown show.
1583,2020-06-30 17:04:46,hinjss,"Remember, it was the Clippers who screwed the deal for Deng, which prohibited us to land all three as free agents."
1584,2020-06-30 14:05:56,hinjss,"I don't buy this revisionist history. First and foremost, [Rose said he did reach out,](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/20981068/nba-derrick-rose-says-did-try-recruit-lebron-james-dwyane-wade-chicago-2010) just not publicly. So the idea that Wade, Bosh, and James refused to come here because DRose did not publicly beg them to is just asinine.

You also have to remember that LeBron had already put in his request to change his number months earlier to no longer be 23 because Miami (and Chicago) retired that number. So I'm more convinced their destination was a forgone conclusion long before any pitches were made."
1585,2020-06-30 16:48:28,hinjss,Yeah I’m not buying that lol.

1645,2020-06-30 23:12:11,hicpa6,"Truth or wishful thinking? Sometmies some of these purportedly ""true"" stories are so out there they defy belief. In a similar vein to the the transgender Gates union, this one smacks too much of make believe. If convincing arguments are to be presented in the case of political and personal corruption we need something more solid than either the unsubstantisated or the rumored. Is it any wonder the general populace dismiss conspiracy theorists so readily? Throwing up assertions like this one supported by somewhat questionable evidence,  simply doesn't convince. I'm guessing this article came from the same source as the one that suggests Boris Johnson was similarly due for execution. Which he wasn't! Take a step back and weigh up the pro's and cons before you commit yourself to the ""truth"" presented. If we believe in every conspiratorial theory without question then we ourselves are the sheep."

2. I’d assume it’d be a bit awkward for him, but to be fair, this is her career. It’s what she’s been doing for 14 years, and I doubt she’s going to stop. Though I do understand why it would make him feel uncomfortable at times. In the end, they love each other and I’m sure he knows those songs aren’t meant to stir up old feelings for her exes."
1648,2020-06-30 00:17:44,hic6l1,"Frankly, if you date a songwriter, you should expect songs to be written about you, songs to be written about his/ her past without you, songs to be written about a possible future with or without you, and fiction.

1649,2020-06-30 00:27:40,hic6l1,"I'm pretty sure Daylight is about Joe! What makes you think it's not? (genuinely curious)

1650,2020-06-30 00:22:50,hic6l1,He's an actor that is in movies with made up relationships where he has to kiss co stars. He knew who she was when he started seeing her. He fell in love with who she is. I'm sure there is enough mutual love and respect in their relationship that she can understand what she sees in a movie isn't real and what he hears in her songs is the past.
1651,2020-06-30 00:30:02,hic6l1,"I’m confused about your point re: Daylight. When does she say that?

Regarding DBATC/“writing pages”, she has said before that the Netflix movie “Someone Great” inspired her to write that song. I def think she drew on her own past experiences while writing it, but it’s not explicitly about a mystery person and I don’t see her mainly drawing inspiration from a movie to write a song having a negative effect on her relationship with Joe. To me, I see it similarly to a romance author still writing new books even if they’re in a long-term relationship.

There are songs on rep that we know aren’t about Joe (like Getaway Car) that were inspired by events that preceded her relationship with Joe. She had every right to still include these on the album, and it seems like she and Joe are secure enough in their relationship to not let that get in his head."
1652,2020-06-30 00:22:01,hic6l1,"Exactly. Kissing scenes and sex scenes shouldn’t get her feeling any type of way, so why should her songs about exes or fictional scenarios get him feeling awkward etc?"

Daylight cant be about Kanye. Its a song about growth.

1683,2020-06-29 20:20:53,hi7g1j,"Oprah talked about her childhood abuse on her show in the 80s and 90s. She grew up in a religious household, so she did obviously know the story of her own name. The baby she had was nameless for three days, then he died. After his death she named him that. Had he lived she said she would have named him something else. Another different biblical

I used to be a big Oprah fan since I’m of African descant (Somalian) it was nice to see a well spoken educated black women on tv, but then I realized quickly what may be the character that is hiding within her when she had a show about religion and claim something so false about religion that I had more respectful the Christian lady who stood up and spoke for her faith that I realized their could be something sinister behind the actions of Oprah. In my faith Islam one potential indication of a practitioner of magic is learn and practicing how to speak backwards and read backwards the scripture, since the devil is completely opposed and at war with humanity as his main goal is to but all of Adams children into the pit of hell along side himself. My faith explicitly condemns the notion of picking up the holy scripture and to read or even pronounce the scripture backwards since that is the action of the devil and the practitioners of magic. 
Reason I explained the above is when I learned that Oprah created a studio named Harpo; which is just her name spelt backwards and my acknowledgement of my understanding of her stance on religion from the encounter I witnessed on her show, was signs and indication enough for me to believe she is involved and in a world and ideology I whole heartedly disagree and condemn and their is high certainty she is a practitioner of occultist magic."

After looking into Spielberg for a minute I came across an essay from an Actor who worked with Spielberg in Back to the Future:

>**What Is It?**  
>  
>**(An essay concerning the subtext of the film by the same title)**  
>  
>**by Crispin Hellion Glover**  
>  
>Is this culture content? Is it happy? Are the smiles broadcast by this culture’s media the smiles that reflect the collective mind? Does the self-professed compassion of the media for the unfortunate seem sincere?  
>  
>Is this culture a Judeo-Christian culture? Is forgiveness a quality of Christian ethos? Didn’t Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold of Columbine high school pose with a caption that stated, “Stay alive, stay different, stay crazy”? Didn’t they target Christians? Weren’t they accused of being “Nazis”? Wasn’t one of them Jewish? Wasn’t one of them an honor student? If these fellows were staying “crazy” and staying “different,” and thinking on their own, were they perhaps manifesting a counter-cultural ideal?  
>  
>What else in this culture were the Columbine killers attacking? Aren’t “jocks,” whom they killed, generally considered common “good guys” by our culture? Don’t jocks represent pro-cultural values? Do those who hold values that counter the culture see jocks as boorish, vapid, brute, conceited and condescending, who willfully insult and violate those who refuse to gang with the masses?  
>  
>Were Harris and Klebold reacting to the media itself? Did they give their own lives and take others to make a point about the media at large? Can it be true that the media-at-large is so neurotic that it is unable to truthfully describe the Columbine event? Is it true that a videotape they produced just before the killings is now being withheld so the public can not determine their own thoughts about Harris’ and Klebold’s statements?  
>  
>In Civilization and Its Discontents, did Sigmund Freud define a neurotic as an individual holding thoughts that clash with those held by the prevailing culture, an individual who subverts those clashing thoughts to the subconscious that later manifest in the form of anxiety and unnecessary behavior? If this is so, what does one consider a culture whose prevailing ideas express hypocrisy, sham and double-standard? Does this somehow define a neurotic culture?  
>  
>Does Steven Spielberg hold the same values I wish upon myself? Does the mind of this grinning, bespectacled, baseball-capped man entirely reflect this culture?  
>  
>Is it true that in his waning years, Orson Welles asked Steven Spielberg for a small amount of money with which he could make a final film? Is it true Steven Spielberg refused? Is it true that Steven Spielberg bought a sled used in Citizen Kane for an extremely large sum of money?  
>  
>Do Steven Spielberg’s passions burn? Do passions burn in the man now imprisoned who wished to anally rape Steven Spielberg? Do our cultural mouthpieces confidently inform us that the wish to anally rape Steven Spielberg is a bad thought? Could anal rape of Steven Spielberg be simply the manifestation of a cultural mandate?  
>  
>Do you believe Steven Spielberg is an ideal guide and influence for our culture? Do Steven Spielberg’s films question our culture? What do Steven Spielberg’s films question? Does Steven Spielberg focus much of his fantasy life on young people? Did he portray children wallowing in sewers filled with fecal matter in Schindler’s List? Did he use children to finger paint an adult in Hook? Does he collect the illustrations of Norman Rockwell, such as the one showing a young boy in his underwear examined by a doctor? Are the inclinations of Steven Spielberg above suspicion by the media-fed culture? Was Steven Spielberg very friendly with Michael Jackson? Wasn’t Michael Jackson supposed to play Peter Pan in Steven Spielberg’s version of the story? Now that Michael Jackson is no longer held in favor by the mass media, does Spielberg associate with him? Do Michael Jackson and Steven Spielberg share similar opinions about the sexuality of young boys?  
>  
>Did Joseph Goebbels popularize certain ideals to the mass culture? Does Steven Spielberg attempt to do the same thing? Is celebrity more special than actual truth in art?  
>  
>When you join in a conversation with strangers, do you openly discuss any idea whatsoever without fear of conflict? Or do you restrain yourself from discussing certain things for fear of offending people and then becoming an outcast? Are there laws that deem certain forms of thought as bad and wrong? Is what is now termed “hate” a form of thought?  
>  
>Does our culture consider it acceptable to have a minstrel represent a black person on film? Does our culture consider it acceptable to have a person of average intelligence represent a retarded person on film? Why is one thing questionable, and one thing acceptable? Did Adolf Hitler entertain any good thoughts? Was Shirley Temple sexy as a young girl?  
>  
>What if you wish to express these ideas? Can people sue you for expressing ideas, particularly if they’re blamed for inspiring behavior considered antithetical to cultural norms?  
>  
>Would the cultural mainstream ever silence or suppress Steven Spielberg? Has the United States government given the immensely wealthy Steven Spielberg millions of dollars to fund a media project that reflects his religious heritage, and his cultural beliefs? Does The Talmud speak of the superiority of the Jews and the inferiority of other cultures and beliefs? Does Steven Spielberg reflect this religious imperative? Is Steve Spielberg neurotic? Is this belief hidden and suppressed?  
>  
>If one discovers that everything one has been taught to be good is actually false, what then? At what point is one neurotic?  
>  
>Did Vincent Van Gogh, Diane Arbus and Rainer Werner Fassbinder die for the sins of their culture? Did Joseph Goebbels?

>Are we fed massive cultural propaganda? Are we infused with the belief that we act as we wish and do what we want? Are we not simply believing what cultural propaganda suggests us to think?

>Do you like MTV? Do you like Steven Spielberg? Do you like post-punk rock? Do you like trip hop? Do you like rap? Do you define yourself according to the music you listen to? Do you consider yourself a true lover of music because you are in a rock band, or because your boyfriend is in a rock band? Do you like tattoos? Do you like body piercing?

Now Canaans 11 sons are also modern day places. Sidon, Heth, and Jebusites are all the owners of Jerusalem. This are just the ones I can find actual data for.

I never even heard of another woman named Oprah. Being a misspelling of a biblical name is one thing, but I don't think anyone who knows who Orpah is would name a child after her so Orpah is just not someone that people name their children after because it would be like bad luck. She lived in Moab, worshipped pagan gods, and didn't return to Judea with her sister Ruth. Also being connected to the mother of Goliah the Philistine giant makes a Woman named Orpah giving birth to a son named Canaan and dieing at birth a seriously an amazing coincidence if that is what it is.

1730,2020-06-30 05:07:18,hi7g1j,"According to wiki it comes from the Jewish Talmud and that Orpha is connected to Herse the mother of Goliath, I am not sure of the specifics but I think connect to might mean as in ""another name for"" Orpah but I haven't read the original text.

""Orpah (Hebrew: עָרְפָּה‎ ʿorpā, meaning ""neck"" or ""fawn"") is a woman mentioned in the Book of Ruth in the Hebrew Bible. She was from Moab and was the daughter-in-law of Naomi and wife of Chilion.[1] After the death of her husband, Orpah and her sister-in-law Ruth wished to go to Judea with Naomi. However, Naomi tried to persuade both Ruth and Orpah to return to their people and to their gods. Ruth chose to remain with Naomi, however, but Orpah chose to return to her people and her gods. (Ruth i. 4 et seq.).
In rabbinic literature, Orpah is identified with Herse, the mother of the four Philistine giants, one of whom was Goliath. These four sons were said to have been given her for the four tears which she shed at parting with her mother-in-law (Babylonian Talmud, Sotah 42b). Her other name Harafa is cognate of the word for threshing; that she allowed herself to be ""threshed"" by many men as one would thresh wheat (Babylonian Talmud, Sotah 42b).
According to a legend in a midrash, Orpah was a sister of Ruth, and both were daughters of the Moabite King Eglon (Ruth R. ii. 9). Her name was changed to ""Orpah"" because she turned her back (from Hebrew: עורף‎, literally nape) on her mother-in-law (ib.; comp. Talmud Sotah l.c.).
The Sanhedrin tractate in the Talmud states that she was killed by King David's general Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, with her own spindle.[2"""
1731,2020-06-30 22:50:17,hi7g1j,"Definitely, when I stumbled on these connections by coincidence I legit thought it would end up being just that, coincidence. After connecting these dots though it really is looking like this is highly plausible and I am amazed."
1732,2020-06-30 09:16:09,hi7g1j,"This is one of my specialties and great observation. that Canaanites became the Phoenicians and also Carthaginians. The Greeks called Canaanites the Phoenicians meaning the purple people since they worked and traded tyrian dye which would stain the skin purple. 

I believe Hams tribe found the preflood teachings of the fallen Angels. The fallen Angel's tought mankind all sorts of forbidden stuff. To understand the fallen Angels you have to know the gnostic truth. The book of Enoch says the fallen Angels landed on Mount Hermon in Syria. Hermon literally means ""Anathema (to vehemently dislike), devoted to destruction"" and was named that because the fallen Angels made their pact to pollute mankind there. That is a real place, and in Syria nonetheless. That is the center of conflict.

I believe Mount Hermon is the heart of the land of Canaan and the reason his people settled there and worship the leader of the fallen angels. I suspect they learned of it being a holy land and discovered the unsettling truth of this reality.

You mentioned the Jebusites, I know they are a tribe of Canaan from my Solomon research. Solomon had ultimate wisdom and a magic ring that bound demons. In building his temple he used the aid of demons then bound them in a brass jar and threw it in the sea.

Solomon grew bored of being so wise and tried everything to be happy but he couldn't find it. He had like 1000 wives, one time he fell for a Jebucian woman but the priests said he must worship Moloch to marry her. He held out for a while and refused, but one time he gave In, performed a ritual to worship Moloch, then went on to become a fool and build temples to Baal/Moloch.

The Babylonians recovered the jar and released the demons back into the world, the head demon/former leader of the fallen Angels. Called himself Beezelboul but that is just a title like Moloch (king) and Baal (Lord), I am pretty sure I know who it is though.

Anyways the Phoenicians, the Canaanites just adopted that name and ended up in Venice I am pretty sure. That is where they started getting into high places becoming court jews, black nobility, and eventually the Rothschilds as one example that I am 99% sure  of that have Canaanites origins. 

They still worship Moloch by sacrificing children, starting wars, and all manner of sexual perversion. The global pedo club are just Canaanites in my opinion doing classic Canaanite stuff. Usury, start wars, sacrifice people, sexually abuse children then sacrifice them to Moloch.........been going on since the ancient days. I think they want Phoenicia back so they can get Mount Hermon and that is one of the main conflicts even in modern day centered in Syria.

The Phoenicians invented phonetics, they literally invented the way we talk yet it is claimed we know almost nothing about them. History just conveniently leaves them out. Alexander the Great conquered Phoenecia and the Capitol of Tyre."
1733,2020-06-30 03:00:26,hi7g1j,"I am no expert on Oprah, but the names are tied to the occult and very oddly connected. My theory would be her mother probably didn't know anything but her father seems to have connections so could have been in a pedo ring. I wonder if the cousin that abused her had connections with the father. To have Oprah grow up in a broken home and sexually abused, then whisked away to her fathers to a new life would have been a good way to be her saviors and a classic way to suck her into a world of sin...... that would be my tinfoil theory and things I would research next to see if there are any evidance or connections. Imagine if we find Oprah's dads name in Epsteins black book or tied to someone like than......man would that be juicy.

This is one of those things that just seems to fit too perfect but could be coincidence. For a woman named after a woman tied to the gods of Canaan to he born in poverty, abused, have a son that dies named Canaan, then to get rescued from that situation and goes on to become the richest and most powerful woman in the world (if I am not mistaken) is a pretty cliche narrative. It could be a crazy coincidence, but I am finding occult red flags everywhere I look when it comes to her.

1764,2020-06-30 00:13:47,hi7g1j,"Wow I see. I wonder where she turned into a friend of John of God because I’ve also seen the clips of her openly discussing Satanic Ritual Abuse with Jewish families and references to the book “Lilith’s Cave”.

One thing that stood out was how one of the girls from the family said that she saw most of the stories from that book play out in real life and if you read some of these stories your mind will fucking be blown if in fact they are true.

But to sum it up it sounds like she had a horrible upbringing and horrible people around her, and in the surface it seems like she was trying to fight them off, but I always take anything celebrity related with a grain of salt.

1780,2020-06-30 07:37:27,hi7g1j,"Well to my surprise, it's was a real thing, not exaggerated. https://www.bh.org.il/blog-items/sacred-orgies-extremist-sabbatean-sect-jacob-frank/

But it was basically a Jewish cult, just like a ""Christian"" cult where scripture gets twisted or fabricated, which leads to twisted practices. And like Christian cults, it was reviled by the rest of the religious community. Prominent Rabbis went out of their way to excommunicate those whom they suspected of being Sabbateans, or even those just suspected of supporting them. And so a lot of those people ended up converting to Christianity, so that makes me think of all the conspiracy theories surrounding the Catholic Church, and hmm 🤔

Eh, it's an interesting rabbithole, but I'm wary of how theories like this may fuel antisemitism. If we could only keep in mind that it was a cult, an abbaration of the main religion. Or in this case, a complete inversion."
1781,2020-06-30 05:16:23,hi7g1j,"""the world defeated the wrong enemy"" is that referencing WWII?"
1782,2020-06-30 05:15:18,hi7g1j,"Yeah but every religion has weird cult offshoots from it. For instance I wouldn't say ""Christians"" when talking about Jonestown."
1783,2020-06-30 10:39:43,hi7g1j,"From memory, there were at least 2 million followers of the Frankish theories, many of whom immigrated to America, settling in new York and California. A lot of the California Frankish Jews went into the film industry, hence the current day corruption and abuse that #metoo is just scratching the surface"
1784,2020-06-30 07:42:28,hi7g1j,"Correct, it is quite the blue pill. Hitler was trying to stop the global banks from creating a new world order but now they have nearly achieved financial domination of the entire world.

The Rothschilds started as court jews to a german kaiser. A court jew was hired by kings to handle the finances since usury (lending at high interest) was against the church and they couldn't commit usury, but it is an important part of the jewish way of life and they would appoint a court jew to handle the usury.

Hitler wanted to single out a very small group of international bankers that were using usury and capitalism to control democracy so it is rigged like we are seeing today. Shit went to shit though and it turned into a ""kill em all and let god sort them out"" type of thing.

It is unsettling to say the least, watch the first 10 minutes to hear what he is saying in his speeches, it will absolutely blow anyone's mind. It feels so dirty to think ""So in hindsight, Hitler was 100% accurate in his predictions?"". That sick feeling is cognitive dissonance, we have been brainwashed like that to avoid anything that goes against the narrative. 

If I link it I suspect I will get banned and it is banned from most platforms, they seriously don't want people learning the truth of ww2 but should pop up of bitchute or something if you google it."
1785,2020-06-30 05:26:48,hi7g1j,"Absolutely, and true Torah Jews would be the real ""Jews"" and they are vastly outnumbered.  The ""weird offshoot"" is literally Israel and its backers.  Israel is not supposed to exist until God redeems the Children of Israel, the Jews.  Until this happens the Jews are to wander the earth as a stateless people."
1786,2020-06-30 22:38:16,hi7g1j,"That’s a pretty damming video, thanks for this, it woke me up on this subject in a major way...this is why it’s so important to share what you know whenever you can. You never know who you may be waking up."

Intersectionality is the framework used to talk about how an individual's various identities interact and influence their life.

Nothing about the concept of white privilege means that white people can't suffer or that other types of privilege don't exist. White privilege doesn't mean your life hasn't been hard, it's just means your skin color is not one of the things making it harder.

>I can't think of anyone in the world more advantaged than the Obama daughters (extremely wealthy, powerful, and apparently very loving parents). I can't really think of anyone less advantaged than, say, a white child born to an opiate-addicted single mother in a depressed town in Appalachia.

You're not wrong that the Obama daughters are incredibly privileged or that the white child of an opiate addict is not very privileged. However, two white girls in the Obamas' economic situation have more advantages than Sasha and Malia do. Similarly, a black child of an opiate addict has a harder road than the white child does. Race isn't the defining factor, but it is always a contributing factor.

>To claim that somehow, the daughter of a coal miner is privileged and the daughter of a president is not is just plain ridiculous.

The daughter of the coal miner still has white privilege. What she does not have is *economic* privilege, and that has a huge bearing on her life. Depending on her other identities, she may also not have straight privilege or cis privilege or any number of other privileges. The daughter of the president does not have white privilege. She does, however, have huge economic privilege, as well as the privileges that come from education, a two-parent household, etc. These identities all interact with one another to shape a person's life.

I completely agree with your view that privilege varies more within groups than between them. However, I don't think it naturally follows from that view that it's useless to talk about privilege based on individual identities. The whole point of talking about something like white privilege is to point out how systemic inequality affects people in all situations, although the effect may be felt differently. Malia Obama has a good life and a lot of privilege, but she is still judged differently from her white peers, and that is worth talking about. A poor white girl may have a hard life and little privilege, but she is still judged differently from her black peers, and that is also worth talking about."

But think if there was a black kid living in the same conditions in Appalachia... who - statistically - has a better chance of improving his situation?

I think this is a fallacy. While it may be true that privelege is more dependent on class than ethnicity (I don't necessarily think so, but I'm not going to argue against it), this doesn't mean that ethnic discrimination should be discounted.

There's two main reasons I think we shouldn't ignore white privilege (for the record, I dislike this term; the problem is not that white people have a privilege, it's that other groups are being disadvantaged):

1. Even if only a small-ish part of the reason you're worse off than someone else is your ethnicity, it's still an injustice. (Especially when *worse off* means being murdered by the police)
2. Race is less fluid than class or other things. You can change your economic status (in general; obviously it's harder than it should be), and your appearance to an extent, but a black person will never be recognized as white"
1869,2020-06-29 17:03:22,hhlsf1,"You’re totally right that a black person can be more privileged than a white person. Like, for example, my (white) dad makes six figures and I’ve been afforded an extremely expensive education, which gives me far more access to opportunities than any poor white kid would ever have.

However, when my mom’s car broke down on a Montana mountain highway when I was seven, my (black) mom, my (black) older cousin, and I walked about 2.5 miles uphill to find a car repair shop. When we found one, the guys politely informed us that they wouldn’t service us. They did offer to let us wait in the lobby until someone could pick us up. When my (white) dad finally got there after an hour or so, he was fuming and they apologized to my mom saying, “sorry ma’am we didn’t know this was your husband.” 

All white privilege means is that your skin color doesn’t drastically (and often negatively) impact your life. I have been refused service twice, once in 2003 (the event described above) and once in 2019. Despite being well-educated, people frequently act surprised that I can form a proper sentence saying things like, “wow, you’re so articulate.” That’s not something anyone would ever say to my white gf because the assumption is she’s smart until proven otherwise. Apparently, to some people, I’m dumb until proven otherwise.

My dad doesn’t get followed around stores like I do when I’m not with him or my gf. My dad nor my gf has never been harassed by the police as like, almost every black person in this country has. My dad’s hair doesn’t get fondled by strangers. My dad isn’t given dirty looks when he goes into an expensive restaurant. 

My dad grew up poor in bumfuck, Iowa. I’d argue his life was LESS privileged than mine. However, he still has white privilege. When you know what white privilege refers to, it’s not really that radical of a thing to discuss."

This is where you lose me.   It may well be that Malia Obama faces certain disadvantages in life, but given her overall position, these just can't be what's worth talking about.  

I guess it's a question of comparative magnitude.  High blood pressure shortens your life expectancy, but not nearly as much as a gunshot.  So if I'm a doctor and I'm seeing a patient with high blood pressure and a gunshot wound, I think the thing that's worth talking about is the gunshot, right?"

The problem is the constant nonsense of assuming that it's ""identities"" that are the most important factor in all this ""privilege"" talk—they're fairly inconsistential compared to the things that aren't ""identities"" like wealth of one's parents, general attractiveness, knowing the right individuals, accent and what-not.

The arbitrary focus on groups wherewith individuals are arbitrarily more likely to ""identify"" in much of this discourse is why I can't take it seriously. If they were actually interested in going from ability to need they wouldn't be primarily focusing on identities, but on what individual needs it more—but the focus is always about some ""identity"" group.

Maybe so, but you cannot deny that Obama's being elected as the president of the US, the offspring of two very wealthy individuals, one of which was the literal chief financial advisor to the Kenyan government was heralded as some kind of breakthrough, a unicum, whereas far less privileged-by-birth individuals had made the US presidency before to little fanfare in that regard.

They were absolutely disproportionally focusing on race in nigh all sections of the popular media.

The talk and assistance that goes to groups that face disadvantages over said group has absolutely nothing to do with how big the disadvantage is and everything to do with how strongly individuals arbitrarily ""identify"" with said group."

Is that really true though? [White people are the second most common targets of racially motivated hate crimes](https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2018/topic-pages/tables/table-1.xls) in the United States. In one instance in Glasgow, a 15 year old white boy named Kriss Donald was kidnapped in murdered before his body was burned by a group of Pakistani men who all later said that they did so because of the color of his skin. White people can most certainly still be affected by racism.

Now you can absolutely make the case that white people might be less likely to be affected by racism, but to use that to assume that any white person you meet has never been negatively impacted by the color of their skin is quite frankly racist."

It's not just that the Obama daughters are rich.  They are way more than just rich.  Their father was also the president of the United States, and (so far as I can tell) they had good and loving parents.  Chelsea Clinton or Baron Trump are also rich presidential children but (so far as I can tell) they lack loving parents, so I think the Obama girls are much better off.  Is there possibly someone better off somewhere in the world? I guess but I really wasn't exaggerating here.

>Are there really no people worse off than that white kid in Appalachia?

Well, I can't really say since I wasn't identifying a specific person.  I have no idea who the least advantaged person actually is, but I wouldn't be surprised if that person (in the US) is white and Appalachian.  Obviously, you'll have to layer on worse stuff -- health conditions and so on -- to find your winner."

I'm not sure that we really disagree.  Certainly, you can be worse off than someone else on account of your race.  Certainly, that's a bad thing.

But do you disagree that the (black) Obama daughters are more ""privileged"" than just about anyone in the world? My claim is that the real variation here is from person-to-person or situation-to-situation rather than race-to-race."
1876,2020-06-28 21:11:50,hhlsf1,"Of course you have to fix the gunshot wound. That's what's urgently killing the person. However, if you're in charge of the patient's health for the duration of their life, then after you've fixed the gunshot wound you're still going to need to address the blood pressure issue. Furthermore, if high blood pressure influences the gunshot wound--if it restricts the pain medications you can give them, for example--then your patient is worse off than another gunshot victim who *doesn't* have high blood pressure.

But more to the point, when you're a doctor you can only treat one problem at a time. As a society, we can address way more than one thing at once. We don't have to table discussions of racism to deal with economic inequality; in fact, these two problems are best addressed together. Malia Obama's experiences with race and racism can give us insight into racial dynamics as a whole. When she is perceived as more of a troublemaker in class than her friend with identical behavior, that speaks to the same dynamic that contributes to lower education and higher incarceration rates for POC, to POC finding it harder than white counterparts to keep well-paying jobs, etc.

The point of talking about privilege isn't to line everybody up from most to least privileged. This isn't the oppression olympics. The point is to recognize and address systemic inequality of various kinds, and to show that one kind of privilege doesn't erase another disadvantage, it only alters how you experience it. Saying you have a particular privilege is really just going, ""Hey, you see that thing you take for granted? Other people can't take that for granted."""

The phrase ""check your privilege"" for example is often used as a way to silence individuals who belong to a ""privileged"" group. But sometimes it's necessary to remind people that they may be blind to an injustice because they haven't experienced it. 

You're right that not all white people are better off than all black people. But if all other variables are equal, white people in America will face fewer obstacles than black people due to a lack of race-based prejudice. 

""White privilege"" also describes the lack of institutional disadvantages that POC (especially blacks) have faced throughout American history, which continue to affect black people today."

If you look at the 99%, race privilege is super noticable and not at all insignificant. People like Obama and his children are extremely lucky to be in the position they're in, and the influences in their lives are so extraordinarily strong that they are greater than the disadvantages they experienced for being black, but most people have much less agency and weaker influences in their lives, which makes ethnic privilege more noticable.

All lies? Truth? Who knows? I like talkn shit. Whats it matter what a random on reddit says about oprah? Shows what kind of person I am you say? Who cares what i think? Or you? Or anybody.

1942,2020-06-28 03:03:15,hh2snv,I'm sure that kind of evil exists within powerful circles but I doubt the ramblings from 4chan are going to shine an accurate spotlight here.
1943,2020-06-29 21:38:20,hh2snv,"Disclaimer: All of the following is dependent on the specific claims being made. There is a spectrum of claims. For example, 1) ""A pedophilia ring was operated from the basement of this particular pizza restaurant"" (highly unreasonable). 2) ""There are a number of secret pedophiles among the global elite"" (obviously true based on statistics alone). 3) ""There exists some organized pedophilia between powerful individuals used for in-group affirmation and control."" 

I consider the relevant meat of Pizzagate to be somewhere around that third claim, and here's what I think of it:

I think it's plausible. Meaning, I don't know of any logical or empirical reason why it couldn't be true. And it certainly explains a lot of observed behavior. (Again, there are specific claims that can be proven or disproven, but I'm not talking about specifics). 

However, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. While a theory may be plausible, a theory this grand and sinister requires more evidence than we have so far for me to ""believe"" it with any confidence.

For me to believe it seriously, I'd need more empirical evidence (like Jeffery Epstein turning over his secret ledger of child sex trades between rich and powerful people for favors), or substantially more behavior that makes the most sense under that explanation. Most things have many possible explanations, and most true explanations are not the one anyone thinks of. So the circumstantial evidence really has to pile up before it has any actual weight.

I could also dismiss Pizzagate entirely if it stopped making any sense at all. As long as there are things like Jeffery Epstein not killing himself, the messed up art in these people's houses, and ""handkerchief pizza maps,"" it's unlikely for the theory to have nothing on its side. But theoretically, I can envision a world where stuff like that doesn't exist, or is a lot rarer than it actually is, and there's no ""motivation"" to believe that anything like Pizzagate is real.

A few notes:

I'm comfortable leaving even extraordinary theories in the ""plausible"" category. I feel no guilt about contemplating any theory. Confidence requires higher standards, but consideration does not.

Vagueness when it comes to details and ""but you can't *disprove""* are totally unconvincing, but also don't disqualify something from the truth. Some theories, on the other hand, can be disqualified by being internally incoherent (logic) or failing to accurate predict observation in reality (empiricism).

Pizzagate is *at worst* in the ""unpersuasively non-disprovable"" zone. Which is enough for me to say maybe, and I'm totally comfortable doing so. I think the evidence is a fair ways stronger that, but not enough to be significant in terms of convincing myself or anyone else of anything concrete.

**TLDR:**

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Pizzagate is an extraordinary claim without extraordinary evidence. But unlike many other other conspiracy theories, I haven't seen anything that disqualifies it from the realm of possibility (setting aside disprovable specific claims)."
1944,2020-06-28 08:13:37,hh2snv,"Look at Jefferey Epstein. Forget any conspiracies about his death, he was arrested for sexually abusing young girls, multiple times. That's just a fact, no conspiracy there. Are there other people in positions of power who are guilty of abusing children? Statistically, almost certainly. But no, I don't think that one pizza place in DC has children in the basement or whatever."
1945,2020-06-29 03:13:36,hh2snv,"I may be mistaken, but wasn’t a person involved in running this supposed child abuse ring (I think this was James Alefantis) found to have some extremely disturbing photos on his instagram of children with their hands taped up with heavy-duty duct tape and things of that nature? Weren’t there some extremely disturbing photos of children found in the restaurant? Regardless of whether an actual child abuse ring was being run by those men, the evidence that they were obsessed with the idea of tied up children and sexual “jokes” involving children seemed pretty undeniable at the time. I don’t know of any decent person who would post a photo like that on their instagram, let alone have pictures of that nature hung up on their walls.

1947,2020-06-29 14:38:23,hh2snv,"Pedo rings exist. This is an established fact. Now whether
 they're making use of a Piazza place in DC or not idk. Podesta and the people in the Epstein/Clinton circle are powerful and connected. If anyone was getting away with shit it's them."
1948,2020-06-30 14:57:25,hh2snv," I think it's pretty silly. Why would they run a pedophile ring out of a pizza restaurant?
  My guess is that some gullible people believe it because it's physically possible this could happen. Any evidence? Nope. But lots of outrageous conspiracy theories are believed because there is a small less than one percent chance they could be true. 
 Now on to claims that powerful people are involved in pedophilia/ sex abuse. My question to no supporters: Is this really as crazy as it sounds? 
  I don't think so. People decades ago didn't believe the Catholic Church sex abuse claims. They thought it was preposterous. When we look back at this we are appalled at how naive people were.
  But it could be possible people in the future will say the same about us. 

  The Jeffrey Epstein revelations. It was revealed in leaked tapes that the Royal Family threatened ABC News about airing what they knew. In the leaked video you see Amy Robach say they had evidence many people were involved. She had details we know today three years ago. The video is from  Project Veritas but ABC didn't deny it was authentic and made up a BS excuse. 
  Is it shocking they didn't air it. Nope. We've learned how Harvey Weinstein intimidated NBC into not reporting bad information about him. Top NBC executives helped cover it up. For years we've been hearing these stories. 

 I think we need to forget about Pizzgate and focus on the story that's in front of us. That corporate media, and political elites could be covering up sexual harassment, child sex abuse etc. 
   The incidents we know about probably aren't outliers. They likely do this because usually it works out fine and they don't get caught. 

  We know about Harvey Weinstein. But how much do we not know?"
1949,2020-06-29 01:38:11,hh2snv,How can the Epstein case play out like it did and we still dismiss pizza gate as a looney right wing conspiracy? It’s not that far-fetched.

He shot several rounds from a military-style assault rifle into a locked closet door of the pizzeria and eventually surrendered to the police. In 2017, he was sentenced to four years in prison.

First it omits the fact that the shooter shot the rounds at the only computer in the place that was keeping all of the surveilance data of the place. The computer was also in a safe compartment. Curious. 

Also the pizza place had known symbols for pedophilia in its logo. Thats why people went bananas after it was mentioned.

Where is the link between pizzagate and Epstein? Did any of the Podesta emails mention Epstein? Did Epstein ever use pizza code? 

I can believe that there are politicians who have participated in child prostitution (from both parties), but pizzagate is claiming more than that. They are claiming it is a *widespread* Democrat conspiracy, with bonus satanism thrown in there. 

What is the evidence that Epstein was directly involved in this widespread conspiracy? Are there any specific details you’re pointing to when you say, “think of Epstein when thinking pizzagate”, or is this more of a vague “a known pedophile and child sex supplier died suspiciously in prison, and therefore it must have been this vast Democrat conspiracy that killed him”?

I just don’t see how you jump from “child sex trafficker caught and dies under suspicious circumstances” to using it to confirm an already debunked conspiracy theory of a vast democratic/satanic/pedophilia ring. What exactly are the dots you’re connecting here?"

This is absolutely invented by the pizzagate crowd. The computer was shot in the top as well, an extremely uncommon place to keep a hard drive. Here's your scenario: ""Hey our computer contains incriminating evidence, wanna throw away that hard drive?"" ""Nah, let's hire a crisis actor to come in and Annie Oakley the hard drive through the wall."" ""Won't that attract attention? We can just throw it in a dumpster, nobody is watching us"" ""Nope, hire the actor!""

> Also the pizza place had known symbols for pedophilia in its logo. Thats why people went bananas after it was mentioned.

Comet ping pong did not ever have 'symbols for pedophilia' in it's logo. Besta Pizza, another pizzaria nearby had a swirl in their logo, also if you've ever worked at a pizza place you can see how often the swirl comes up.

Madeline McCann was a child that went missing, and they released a sketch of who took them. Pizzagate believers think that it was the Podesta brothers working together. Here's the fun part:

The sketch was the result of the police talking to two separate people about the ONE person they said they saw. Police sketches and our ability to recollect the exact details of a face are so shitty that they came up with 2 versions of the same man. A man between ages of 20 and 40, the Podestas were in their 60's at the time. Not to mention that their is no proof the Podestas were in Portugal, nor that they have since arrested a sexual predator who is linked to Portugal and the McCanns.

2249,2020-06-27 20:28:15,hh0ulg,"Well, I was shopping in Walmart the other day, (with the intent of buying all of their guns, bacon and American flags) when I spotted a Mooslem running frantically up and down through the aisles, and his name was Abdul-Mohammed-Jamal-Jabar-Steve-Jabar-Omar-Abdul. I was certain at any moment he would yell 'Allah Akbar'. Thankfully, my shopping cart was full of bacon (which as you all know, is Mooslem kryptonite). So I straightened my MAGA hat and pulled up my Confederate flag britches and grabbed a pack of bacon from my cart. I took that Mooslem over my knee and spanked his ass with the bacon while screaming 'Liberalism is a mental disorder!' over and over. Then, by the power of the bacon,  Abdul-Mohammed-Jamal-Jabar-Steve-Jabar-Omar-Abdul instantly converted to Christianity and registered as a Republican. Trump showed up and awarded me the Medal of Honor because I probably stopped the next 9/11.

2274,2020-08-20 16:44:09,iczl48,"It's funny that you mention Oprah's advocacy for the law of attraction. She had a cancer patient who attended her show die, because she became a convert to the idea and refused further treatment.

""facts are subjective"". huh? Are you saying this ironically, or do you mean interpretation of facts is relative to perspective and intent?

I agree with most of what you're saying here. It does seem that many are being encouraged, especially through online means, to implant themselves into echo chambers, in order to solidify their own visions of reality. Social media is self serving in this way. Memes reinforce this, heavily, as do the upvotes and likes granted by those who control the narrative.

Oddly, people tend to think the ""democratic"" nature of social media represents public opinion, when, if you observe it through an objective lens (as much as one can have), it certainly appears to be the manufacturing of opinion.

ironically, the marxist philosophy/ideology, uses the veil of collectivism to reinforce, as you said, personal empowerment through virtue signaling, ie selfishsteem.

Is there a better system than what we've got? for sure! But global communism isn't it. Micromanagement of independent communities and persons by an overseer, who has no  relation to the common person, will not end well for anyone but those who manage.

See Plato's Republic (healthy city/feverish city), it explains how this always goes, as well as why. It also explains how to avoid it.

Many of these advocates for marxism are still unable to make eye contact with the homeless person at a stop light, as advocating for someone else to fix the situation is much easier than giving up your own spending power. Such too, is the mindset of most with great wealth.

LOA related- the perversion of philosophical and religious pursuit of truth comes in the form of the self serving individual who utilizes the idea of manifesting their reality for their own gains. Sophistry and prosperity preaching, done by those with no genuine self reflection or meta cognition, will destroy all things great.

just saying."
2275,2020-08-20 00:38:33,iczl48,I would say the more dangerous radicalization is the literal Nazi/fascsist radicalization going on that has already lead to dozens of terrorist attacks
2276,2020-08-21 15:12:58,iczl48,One thing law of attraction has going for it is how many successful people never doubted that they will be successful. I wouldn't consider it marxist. A lot of it is people who are trying to manifest financial success. Its another prosperity gospel.

2282,2020-08-19 19:48:54,icu4jz,"This is a brave post, and you make some excellent points, as usual, as the Survivor Warrior that you are :)

&#x200B;

>Watching James and Wade emote and talk about their trauma helped me emote and talk about my trauma. It was as though Leaving Neverland offered me a crowbar to pry open my thickest doors of denial. 

&#x200B;

Part of that is true for me as well. Having some conversations with you, public and private, have taken me even further, and I  thank you for that.

&#x200B;

>Even when we don’t know a person irl, if their music, dance, artwork, blogs, novels, films, or videos help us access or escape from our own emotions, it sets off the same kind of euphoric chemical reaction we get when we confide in a good therapist or connect with a close friend. Of course it’s not a real relationship. That’s an illusion but it feels like the real thing. So we’re prone to developing loyalties and attachments to celebrities or YouTube personalities who don’t even (or barely) know we exist. For some of us, the loyalty and attachment is so fierce, we spend our free time arguing *with* strangers, *on behalf* of strangers, *in a forum full of strangers*. Good Lord, it’s a lonely way to exist.  
>  
>  
>  
>The conclusion may seem obvious but my subconscious brain still needs reminders: Just because I can relate to Wade and James, that *does not make me guilty of being a liar or a fraud* just because some people claim that’s what they are. Likewise, just because a Michael Jackson fan admires his work or can relate to his public persona, that *doesn’t make that fan guilty of pedophilia* just because he’s been accused of that crime. **We are not the people we argue about here.** **We are not responsible for their guilt or innocence either.** This is not to say we aren’t interconnected because we are. James Safechuck, Wade Robson, Michael Jackson, Dan Reed, and Danny Wu all reflect the best (artistic) and worst (exploitative) aspects of our human nature right back at us. But, fundamentally, **Leaving Neverland is not about you or me.**

&#x200B;

All excellent points we would all -- whether we believe Michael Jackson to be guilty or innocent -- do very well to remember."
2283,2020-08-19 23:09:41,icu4jz,Good luck on your journey. I wish you the best.
2284,2020-08-20 10:16:46,icu4jz,"I don’t agree. People who represent the CSA survivor point of view are obviously going to be seen as part of the same community as CSA survivors, whereas MJ fans never shared any experience MJ had. So no, it doesn’t make sense for them to say “I’m MJ”, it does make sense to say “I’m Wade/James”."
2285,2020-08-21 22:28:14,icu4jz,I agree with this.   And I don’t mean to diminish our warrior.  But I Def feel like their is a kindred-ship with Wade and James.
2286,2020-08-20 11:08:56,icu4jz,"It’s about justice. What happened to MJ (falsely accused all the time of everything from plagiarism, animal abuse, raping women to CSA) can happen to anyone. So in that way ‘we are all MJ‘"
2287,2020-08-20 11:29:19,icu4jz,"The animal abuse is well documented, actually, and the CSA accusations are due to a lot of evidence and clues and all you gotta do to know it’s true is connect the dots with the bare minimum common sense. 
All the other accusations you listed I’ve never heard of (and the one about raping women is particularly odd given that he said out loud and showed with his actions that he was afraid of women). 
Anyway, if people identify with him for that reason then they’re all the more suspicious because most people who get accused of rape or CSA actually end up being guilty (because statisically only around 3% of accusers are false accusers and the logical conclusion is that everyone else must be telling the truth), so...

Edit: oh yeah, and probably the plagiarism is true because he stole songs from Quincy Jones soooooo yeah"
2288,2020-08-20 13:13:52,icu4jz,"‘Well documented’, ‘evidence’, ‘clues’, statistically’, ‘probably’

You’re something else..

‘Statistically’ people who are prominent Virtue Signallers are more likely to commit the acts they are signalling. 

That would mean you girl..
And that comes from Survivor_Warriors post on this very sub..

We saw a lot of famous MJ haters recently turn out to be perpetrators themselves btw, kinda adds up"

2292,2020-08-19 20:00:39,icsx16,"Men are assumed to be guilty of any harassment.  In me too movement most activists said believe the victim until proven otherwise. This is wrong on so many levels. You are basically undermining the whole law structure. And for allegations no proof whatsoever needed. And if the claims are false, the women faces no repercussion. 

There was a case about rohtak brave sisters. They beat a man in bus, recorded it and claimed the man was harassing her.  The man selection in army was stopped. Despite other bus passengers claiming the man's innocence, the media declared the man guilty. The girls received various awards for same. Celebrities endorsed her but when truth came out nobody questioned them.

Men are expected to be bread earner and maintain wife. There are judgements where jobless, disabled men are asked to maintain able to earn wife. Men are expected to take tough, dangerous jobs. In any calamity men are last one to be rescued. Women and children get priority."

2294,2020-08-20 04:11:17,icsx16,"I can make a long post topic wise highlighting the blatant lack of men's rights in India but this is not the place for it. I would suggest just read mensdayout news site and follow hashtags like #mentoo, #false498a, #GenderBiasedLaws, #HusbandMurder, #CrimeHasNoGender on twitter, and follow Deepika Bharadwaj and Mensdayout. Men's rights movement has always been active in India since long time, trying to protest against the bias but general public is not much aware, simply because they don't realise how pathetic are the laws unless they themselves get affected. It will take at least 20 years, men shunning marriages and relationships completely, and the suicide number of falsely accursed and harrassed men to reach like 20 lakhs per year (it's around 1 lakh only now) for government and general public to realise. Till then nothing will happen. The entire reason men have given up on marriages in US, UK etc is because of hopelessly biased laws, but now still they suffer parental alienation and are giving up on fatherhood. In India, the laws are even worse."

2319,2020-08-19 15:51:37,icnccm,"Not gonna lie, I don`t really like when people call their pets their furbabys, I think it`s kinda cringy and supports the troughts of breeders that CF people secretly DO want children, and their pets are just filling a void. 

I love my cat to death, but she is (thankfully!) Not a child. She is a cat. That`s what I like about her. 

But then again, I really don`t care if someone makes a fb post on mothersday about their dog, whatever. 

I would like a pet-day though ^^ a day where everyone chares storys about animals :3"
2320,2020-08-19 19:50:59,icnccm,"It's not that wrong tho. Pets are not children.

Pets are companions, sure, they help us and we take care of them but are NOT children. Stop humanizing pets, I see too many times people dressing up dogs (where its not needed) or not letting them walk, breeding absurdities.

Now please, we are childfree, not mindless people."
2321,2020-08-19 13:38:09,icnccm,"For once I'm with the outragers.  Pets aren't the same.  That's kind of the point.  I have a dog, I love my dog, she's definitely part of the family, but it's not the same as a kid.  That's why I have a dog and not a child... because it's different.  

People just need to worry about their own stuff.  Mothers day is for mothers, Fathers day is for fathers, Halloween is for vampires.  Not every holiday needs to belong to everyone."
2322,2020-08-19 14:59:25,icnccm,"Oh god I hate the daily mail it's such a pit of bilge. 

Sorry, just needed to get that out of the way : )

What exactly do mothers lose if people with pets celebrate mothers' day too? It's not like pet owners are demanding maternity leave and child benefit. 

I wouldn't do it myself, but then I don't celebrate mothers' day anyway because I think it's consumerist nonsense. You shouldn't need the calendar to remind you to be grateful to the ones you love, or to show them generosity."
2323,2020-08-19 21:11:15,icnccm,"Kids are horrible, but calling your pets ""my children"" isn't any better."
2324,2020-08-19 19:31:42,icnccm,"\> Why the need to gatekeep motherhood to this degree 

? OK but having a pet \*isn't\* the same as having a child? Having a child is a billion times harder, everyone here knows that and that's why they prefer pets? Am I going crazy? Of course it's silly to celebrate Mother's Day if you aren't the mother to a child. It's not gatekeeping motherhood anymore than it's gatekeeping pants if you don't call them a shirt."
2325,2020-08-19 21:04:00,icnccm,"Pets are not children, and I can’t stand people who use them as surrogate babies (empty nesters in my family) BUT I have used “pet parent” to describe myself before. 

I love them, they love me, and “owner” makes me think that they’re nothing more than objects to be possessed. “Pet parent” or “guardian” describes more of a relationship I cherish and work at than “I bought this animal and it looks at me occasionally”.

I also like thinking of them as family so.. it’s not a stretch to think of me, the provider, as their parent."
2326,2020-08-19 18:15:51,icnccm,"I really don't feel strongly about this, but I did think it was strange that this year it seemed like a lot of people wished me a happy Mother's Day as a dog mom."
2327,2020-08-19 20:06:55,icnccm,"well. you have animals day for that and raising a child is alot harder than raising a pet. The    
consequences of fucking up are also 1000 bigger that fucking up a pet."
2328,2020-08-20 00:37:42,icnccm,BLESS YOU OPRAH!!
2329,2020-08-19 22:25:44,icnccm,"WHO THE CRAP CARES?! Honestly! Real problems are happening in the world but people are throwing fits because ""Waaa she said she was a pet mommy!!!!"" Why do you care? How does that effect you in anyway, shape or form?! It's not killing you, it's not hurting your kids, and it's SO STUPID! I'M SO FREAKING TIRED OF THIS!"
2330,2020-08-19 19:23:25,icnccm,Breeders usually have no identity outside being a mommy or a daddy especially if they are women. The idea that someone can embody their single identity PLUS have a life/career/hobby/travel plans etc makes them feel like they've achieved less in life. They get defensive about it. Breeders are also some of the worst gatekeepers in society. They'd gatekeeper gatekeeping if they could figure out how.
2331,2020-08-19 22:17:24,icnccm,It's a good thing idc what other people think about how I live my life. My pets are my kids and I truly don't care if that bothers anyone.
2332,2020-08-19 23:01:58,icnccm,"Hum? Why is... any of that? 

Don't need mothers Day. Have day for cats and one for dogs. Or have no days and don't tell anyone when you feed a cake to your giraffe or whatever."
2333,2020-08-19 23:33:20,icnccm,"She’s not wrong though. I love my 2 cats and I absolutely do consider them to be part of the family, but having a pet is not at all the same as raising a human child."
2334,2020-08-19 23:38:04,icnccm,"I don't *want* Mothers day to be for me. It's a day for kids to give a card/present to their mother. I'm not a Mother, so I don't expect or want any salutation, card or gift...I'm definitely not my Cat's mother...I'm tailless, my fur is minimal and I have a mere 2 nipples 😂 All the posts on fb trying to make it a day for everyone ('plant moms' etc!) are cringe."
2335,2020-08-20 01:37:22,icnccm,"Right like *that’s* your first issue here? Birthing? 

It just speaks to the projected regret people like that are harboring. People who **like** being parents don’t have the internalized resentment required to get upset about something as stupid as other people being happy about their pets."
2336,2020-08-20 03:03:36,icnccm,Every father out there is also ‘not a parent’ since he didn’t give birth *eyeroll*.
2337,2020-08-19 23:45:55,icnccm,"Well, your Dog IS a Mother- so it's fitting for mothers day. I'm glad your pooch is free of that horrific existence now, and getting a proper doggie life."
2338,2020-08-19 22:40:40,icnccm,"I call my cats my babies. But furbaby creeps me out. 

My grandma has confused the terms and tells me to 'hug the furries for her'. I'm not about to explain to 81 year old grandma why that sentence is weird though."
2339,2020-08-19 21:35:53,icnccm,"Yesssssss! Thank you! I don't like referring to myself as a ""furmom,"" or dog mom. I'm NOT a mom."
2340,2020-08-19 19:42:46,icnccm,"I agree with you about treating pets like children, it’s never really sat right with me. I love animals but I don’t see them the same way I see people and I’ve never really liked the concept of “unconditional love” whether it’s from a human or a dog or whatever. Love should be conditional, otherwise it’s meaningless to me."
2341,2020-08-19 23:41:12,icnccm,"I celebrate international Cat day by posting a pic of my Cat wishing all my friends cats a happy day. There's a day for Dogs too, but a general 'companion animal' day would be nice- to include less common creature friends- such as ferrets, lizards etc."
2342,2020-08-19 23:31:59,icnccm,"Yes!!!! Stop these dressing up games! I've never seen a pet that likes it. Your pet is uncomfortable and you look ridiclious. 
Also stop feeding them human junkfood. Just stop."
2343,2020-08-19 17:30:05,icnccm,Yeah. I dont need to be called a cat mom because I take care of a cat.
2344,2020-08-19 16:13:20,icnccm,"I’m with you on this. Yes, you need to take care of your pets and take them to the vet and keep them healthy and engage with them and feed them every day. But that’s nowhere near the level of care that a child requires. Plus, when you have a child you’re responsible for teaching them wrong from right, teaching them about the world and how to be a good member of society, instilling in them values and a moral compass, and dealing with a fully independent human being with their own thoughts, beliefs, behaviors, etc. I would never want to do all of that for a child, but I acknowledge that it’s a lot more work than having a dog or a pet of any kind. 

I completely agree with you that lots of people get pets because they’re NOT the same as having kids! That’s the point!"
2345,2020-08-19 17:28:59,icnccm,"Pets are not babies, my fur goldos bebes were carefully planned for, we planned the purchase of our house so they can live happy and thrive, we have pet sitters and vet care for them, we soend time with them and tend to their well being and stimulation, so yes, in a way, my doggos are better off than many kids, yes they are way better and fluffier and we love them deeply"
2346,2020-08-19 13:52:41,icnccm,[deleted]
2347,2020-08-19 15:50:28,icnccm,"I'd say, why can't I have ""catternity leave"" to get a new kitten, settle them down, train them to use the litter tray/go to the garden, etc.? Having a kid is as much a choice as getting a pet. 

I'd also like to take time off to travel the world, pursue other hobbies, whatever, again, lifestyle choices. 

Yet only if you choose to procreate you get the privilege of statutory pay (or even full pay, depending on your employer), for an extended period of time, keeping your job safe in the event you want to come back. 

In an overpopulated world, I'd think people should be rewarded not to have more children, but hey, that's discussion for another post.

But I agree, it takes nothing from mothers/fathers if furry parents want to celebrate, and I agree too that such celebrations are nothing but a marketing ploy to get you to spend money...."
2348,2020-08-19 23:54:42,icnccm,"I refer to myself as ""her human"" if I'm talking about my Cat. I dislike 'pet' and 'owner.'"
2349,2020-08-20 01:24:55,icnccm,"Sadly she passed away, but her last 5 years were the years she deserved. 

Currently I have yet another Boston who was meant to be a breeder, but had a genetic defect that prevented her puppies from surviving. She's doing great with us and will never breed again!"
2350,2020-08-19 23:28:27,icnccm,Grandma no! 😂
2351,2020-08-19 23:44:02,icnccm,"It's not really unconditional. My cat gets angry with me when I've flea-treated her and glares very unlovingly my way for a while. I've tried explaining that my 'cruelty' is helping her, but...she's a cat."
2352,2020-08-19 23:49:34,icnccm,"A mother friend called me this, ""you're such a great Cat mom!"" When i did end of life care for a sick, elderly rescue kitty. She's a good parent and a big animal lover so she was being nice, I cringed a little but didn't say anything!"
2353,2020-08-19 13:56:08,icnccm,"No, I don't. 

It's also supposed to humorous to add some levity to an otherwise ranty post, but here we are."
2354,2020-08-19 23:35:03,icnccm,Yeah I'm just ignoring it. I don't want her googling it because she lives alone and I dont want her falling down!

2356,2020-08-19 14:09:00,icnccm,"Okay, celebrate Halloween however you like whether or not you are currently a vampire.  Does that make you feel better?"

2368,2020-08-18 18:41:02,ic6wla,"Well, I was shopping in Walmart the other day, (with the intent of buying all of their guns, bacon and American flags) when I spotted a Mooslem running frantically up and down through the aisles, and his name was Abdul-Mohammed-Jamal-Jabar-Steve-Jabar-Omar-Abdul. I was certain at any moment he would yell 'Allah Akbar'. Thankfully, my shopping cart was full of bacon (which as you all know, is Mooslem kryptonite). So I straightened my MAGA hat and pulled up my Confederate flag britches and grabbed a pack of bacon from my cart. I took that Mooslem over my knee and spanked his ass with the bacon while screaming 'Liberalism is a mental disorder!' over and over. Then, by the power of the bacon,  Abdul-Mohammed-Jamal-Jabar-Steve-Jabar-Omar-Abdul instantly converted to Christianity and registered as a Republican. Trump showed up and awarded me the Medal of Honor because I probably stopped the next 9/11.

2393,2020-08-18 17:28:27,ic5gk6,"Well, I was shopping in Walmart the other day, (with the intent of buying all of their guns, bacon and American flags) when I spotted a Mooslem running frantically up and down through the aisles, and his name was Abdul-Mohammed-Jamal-Jabar-Steve-Jabar-Omar-Abdul. I was certain at any moment he would yell 'Allah Akbar'. Thankfully, my shopping cart was full of bacon (which as you all know, is Mooslem kryptonite). So I straightened my MAGA hat and pulled up my Confederate flag britches and grabbed a pack of bacon from my cart. I took that Mooslem over my knee and spanked his ass with the bacon while screaming 'Liberalism is a mental disorder!' over and over. Then, by the power of the bacon,  Abdul-Mohammed-Jamal-Jabar-Steve-Jabar-Omar-Abdul instantly converted to Christianity and registered as a Republican. Trump showed up and awarded me the Medal of Honor because I probably stopped the next 9/11.

2425,2020-08-18 17:11:01,ic541m,"Well, I was shopping in Walmart the other day, (with the intent of buying all of their guns, bacon and American flags) when I spotted a Mooslem running frantically up and down through the aisles, and his name was Abdul-Mohammed-Jamal-Jabar-Steve-Jabar-Omar-Abdul. I was certain at any moment he would yell 'Allah Akbar'. Thankfully, my shopping cart was full of bacon (which as you all know, is Mooslem kryptonite). So I straightened my MAGA hat and pulled up my Confederate flag britches and grabbed a pack of bacon from my cart. I took that Mooslem over my knee and spanked his ass with the bacon while screaming 'Liberalism is a mental disorder!' over and over. Then, by the power of the bacon,  Abdul-Mohammed-Jamal-Jabar-Steve-Jabar-Omar-Abdul instantly converted to Christianity and registered as a Republican. Trump showed up and awarded me the Medal of Honor because I probably stopped the next 9/11.

I was certain at any moment he would yell 'Allah Akbar'. Thankfully, my shopping cart was full of bacon (which as you all know, is Mooslem kryptonite).

2433,2020-09-07 15:20:19,io882c,"I figure it is just one faction of the deep state versus the other. It’s always the traditionalists vs the globalists. Playing enemies in public but, are buds at the Baphomet orgies. I think Q is just one faction trying to play the other for power. Airing out the others dirty laundry. It’s all one big swamp with alligators wrestling to see who gets to run the show. 

Both sides are pedos. It’s just this time the globalist trafficking network is being exposed. And here we are in the middle trying to decide who are the good guys. None of them are. Trump and Q are the traditionalist faction and the dems are part of the globalist faction. Controlled opposition at every step. 

The Rich don’t think like us. They don’t behave like us. They don’t like us. They are pitting us against each other while they count their profits. 

We are the sheep in the pen focused on not getting eaten by the dog when we are being raised to be led to slaughter by the farmer who feeds us. 

Break the godspell and wake up. Both sides are playing us. One may be the lesser evil and it probably fluctuates with time but, don’t let that fool you into thinking they are good or doing anything for our benefit."
2434,2020-09-07 14:42:33,io882c,"I believe there are elements of truth to the Q movement. There are also parts of it I do not buy & find a little troubling. It involves many conspiracies that people already believe & incorporates them into the belief. It also brings in the issue of pedophilia among the elites, which is coming out more & more. The troubling part is how Trump is painted as a tool of God to break up this system. It also only involves people that have criticized Trump. His enemies are labeled as pedophiles or pedophile enablers. Then there is the thinking that Trumps behavior is to be dismissed as part of the plan & him playing a role to expose these rings. This allows him to do just about anything & it be excused by the followers. Some followers fall into a cult like mindset where they blindly believe anything Q says & do not think for themselves in regards to Trumps actions. If you are able to support Q & still maintain independent thought it’s fairly harmless, but some do not seem to do that, which makes it possibly dangerous down the road"

Is it because this subreddit really is so anti QAnon? Or is it something else? ""When do you expend ammunition? All for some LARPer in a basement?"". QAnon is real. Now I conservatively say they're 90% legit info and 10% disinfo, after all they themselves even say ""Disinformation is necessary"". 

Anyway, don't let the paid vocal minority in your comments make you think that everyone here is anti QAnon. They are just serving the agenda, posting pro establishment narratives while trying to seem like a normal dude, bro. QAnon is real, and I consider this to be proof that it is actually being run by Trump and Company.

If I hop on twitter and accuse Trump of raping my butt when I was a kid, does he need to come out and deny my allegations?

And Tom Hanks went to Greece cause he likes it there. We have an extradition treaty with them so Tom couldn’t hide there if he was a criminal. He would have to go to Russia or China."

It’s not about everything being equal, it’s about things that are traditionally underrepresented, not being underrepresented.""

>Let me try a metaphor. Chris and Pat are each building a Commander deck. Each week they’re allowed to visit the game store and buy cards. Chris gets to buy ten cards a week and can get any rarity. Pat only gets to buy two cards a week and can only buy commons and uncommons.  
>  
>In ten weeks, Chris has a deck. It takes Pat fifty weeks. When they play, Chris beats Pat the vast majority of the time because Chris’s deck is just significantly stronger.

>That’s fair, right? Each now has the same restrictions. It’s “equal”. But it’s not. Chris got a huge advantage for a long time. If the goal is to help Pat’s deck have a chance against Chris’s, you have to give Pat a period where Pat gets access to more and better cards than Chris otherwise Pat will never catch up.

So... based on the above logic, WotC is intentionally over-representing targeted groups that were under-represented in the past."
2497,2020-09-05 12:02:23,imv7g0,"Not even attractive, middle aged black women. lol

Yeah, it's kind of lame. It turns me off a lot of times, especially when they give this SJW treatment to commander precons. Are you looking for a cool, badass commander to play and get you excited about the game? Sorry, you get boring lesbian lady instead or middle aged, cancer patient. I mean seriously? I'm ok with it if it is a card in the deck, hell even a legendary, but to have this kind of lame art be the main card, the commander, that is just dumb.

Also, where are the cool middle-aged men  or elderly men as commanders? We got Kenrith, that is like the only one I can think of and I'm not even sure I would call him cool. He is basically Dad on Eldraine which is lame. Kenrith is not riding on a golden eagle or doing anything cool, just posing for family photos. Weak.

My theory is the art team at WotC pretty much consists of lesbians. The art director is a woman I know for sure, and she is probably a lesbian.

Oh well, no skin off my back. I'm not supporting WotC anymore. I'm playing Legends of Runeterra where there are plenty of hot chicks in the artwork. Legends of Runeterra is not immune to the SJW's of the world, but the game has not succumbed to it as of yet. Maybe if WotC crashes and burns, Riot can pull back."

None of that would be a problem if they were lead in a competent way by someone who seeks to make the best product they can, but they're not, and so in their shitty ""I'm a minority I know what's good, fuck straight white men!"" crusade they'll smear the game in idpol shit because they're completely devoid of empathy or good will.

And people are up in arms about Kinnan because Wizards printed one fat character who wasn't a demon or a corrupt politician in the history of magic. Some people be fat. Sorry you don't like there being one fat person in the entirety of the magic lore. No, he's not attractive. He's just fat. Not everyone can be Gerrard Capashen (sploosh)"

2509,2020-09-05 12:55:51,imv7g0,"Welp - this thread made me rethink my joining this sub.
I'm fine with people trying to escape groupthink, and point out where the recent SJW agenda leads to creative decisions that aren't good for the game.
And the banning of Therese Nielsen makes me absolutely furious, even if I don't support the right-wing accounts she did.

But calling people faggots, and queens, lesbians, and trannies is way beyond the pale.

Leaving now."
2510,2020-09-06 10:39:03,imv7g0,"I'm not noticing a huge difference with Nahiri, but the alt-art is noticeably better.  Most MTG characters are unattractive solely on principle; you don't want the nerds getting jealous, nor do you want them horny.  What we care about is what happens when you turn them sideways.

That being said, Nahiri has always been one of the more attractive characters, in no small part to her cute leather outfit.  Is she a compelling character?  Definitely more than Nissa.  But given how old and morally ambiguous she is, her beauty is not the highest point on their checklist.  Nahiri's been remarkably on-model for her lifespan as a character, unlike Teferi.

However, I did notice they backpedaled a lot on the infamously ugly Ice Cream Tub Radha from Dominaria and made her more of a middle ground amazonian.  I appreciated that.  Still off-model from the original, almost to the point of being unrecognizable.  That's a much bigger gap than Nahiri I think."
2511,2020-09-05 19:47:03,imv7g0,"Maaaybe the problem is that you have trouble respecting black women in general, and in particular when they aren't presented as sexy? Hmmmm."

2515,2020-09-05 16:29:15,imv7g0,"What the heck even is this example, it includes 2 point at which Maro makes assumptions that are just wrong:

1. rares are better than common and uncommons
2. You always build the strongest commander deck you possibly can

I've had my ass handed to me by a pauper commander deck lots of times (Tatyova as commander, all other cards common). If Pat uses 50 weeks to buy the exact content of said Tatyova deck and Matt just buys some normal commander cards Pat will crush him easily. This example is just insanely bad, even when not considering what Maro is trying to say with it."
2516,2020-09-06 21:18:54,imv7g0,"The thing is that there was never an underepresentation of black people in the game. Look at the old Dominaria sets: You had Femeref and Zhalfir and all the various human creatures that hailed from there. You had Sisay, Crovax (There are actually still to this day more versions of Crovax than any of the old weather light crew), Sidar Jabbari, Teferi, Mangara, etc... you had multiple sets that took place in their homelands. It's a fallacy."
2517,2020-09-11 15:29:44,imv7g0,that's why every Pirate in ixalan was an elderly unattractive woman. They couldn't even give the world one badass male pirate. Instead we get Admiral Beckett Brass

The only people the Reserved List is for are pearl-clutching hoarders that don't care about people wanting to play eternal formats. 

The Reserved List benefits nobody but collectors. I'd much rather have my reserved list cards lose some value if it means that more people can get the cards they want without having to proxy.

I mean, I still don't have a problem with proxies to be honest, but I'd prefer if everyone have the actual cards."

You're right that there is not much we are allowed to say, even after we make ourselves known as survivors.  It's like we are allowed to be meek, but always have to be in control. It's not realistic, and just makes the whole problem worse. 

I like to think that every day I am closer to just being completely honest with everyone about what happened to me. But the expectations are crippling. I'm not sure yet how to do it yet."

Thats how he used me. That’s how I thought of myself. That’s how I acted out with him.  When I remember exposing my ass in public for his pleasure, I cringe.

The post was born from a stifled frustration because I wasn’t permitted to speak the truth. My family wanted none of that. Then when attempting to write about it, I was bending over backwards trying to keep it ‘nice’. I didn’t want to make anyone feel uncomfortable with explicit language. 

I simply needed to get it out of me without self-censoring.

At 10pm, John goes live with Carmen. About halfway through the almost 3 hour video, it’s brought up that Auntie replaced John on Sharrell’s Friday night show (recall last time John was invited, he got messy with Perry). Then it’s brought up that Yahooboy and Leida are “trashing” him by saying Carmen is a liar (she is). Carmen drops off the live, leaving John with Kentucky Mattress Kristy and Mommy Monica. Yahooboy jumps in the chat and starts trolling John hard, so John puts him in the screen and it’s just SO MESSY. https://youtu.be/y1tp30nbC3I

Speaking from experience I’m sorry you went through this but glad you were strong enough to handle the separation. It sucks all around."
2729,2020-10-08 22:01:53,j7loo7,"I don't know what to say other than that I'm sorry. The only thing I'd point out is you said it might have been your ""biggest mistake"" to take some time and space for yourself when the pressure of dealing with the relationship  became too much to handle. You absolutely deserve to have the comfort and safety you need and you are not responsible for you ex-boyfriend's delusions. It isn't your fault and there's nothing you should have done differently. 

I am very sorry that you lost a meaningful, long-term relationship, but it sounds like your former boyfriend became an incredibly toxic person really quickly and I'm glad you are out of that situation. Of course, I also hope that in time he will find his way out of the place he's in now - but that's not your burden to bear.

Hugs and best wishes to you."

I’m so sorry you’re dealing with this.  Time heals and consider this a silver lining in getting out of this toxic relationship.  I wish my partner would just leave me because I finding it extremely difficult to leave him (but I know I have to); exit plans take time with kids.

All the best to you.  Refocus yourself on your hobbies and taking care of your mental health.  Cut off all your Qties and consider this a new lease of life."
2731,2020-10-09 02:00:38,j7loo7,"Take good care of yourself first and foremost. These are crazy times. It sounds like you care about him a lot, so if it’s not too much for your mental health, you could tell him you’re there if he wants to talk or send him resources that debunk QAnon. No guarantee he’ll turn around though. A huge part of QAnon is homophobic and says that the LGBT community is trying to normalize pedophilia (which is obviously not true). If you think all is lost and don’t want to ever see him again, try to look forward to the future. There are so many guys out there who would love to go on a hike with you. Take care of yourself and then get back out there, you might meet the man of your dreams who makes you understand why this had to happened this way. ❤️"
2732,2020-10-09 14:42:50,j7loo7,"Ive been dealing with a Q spouse for several years and this is what I have come to understand: It fills a place in their soul that was empty. It takes a crazy world where they don’t feel completely happy and gives them concrete reasons as to why they feel that way, and why its not their fault.  It gives them a sense of comfort because suddenly everything wrong in their lives can be explained, and a path to make it right appears . And they are also suddenly important; they are awake and smart and they have figured it out! AND they will be saving babies and children from horrible fates.  It’s heroin for their soul.

If i haven’t been married to this person for 20 years with a teenager i would have left long ago. As it is its just too complicated right now with money and finances. I think its actually a good thing you were able to get away.  I dont think these q ppl will stop at the election. Even if trump loses the narrative will continue and they will keep sucking people along with more reasons for them to keep trusting the plan."
2733,2020-10-09 09:48:43,j7loo7,"Sorry you are going through this. There are so many seemingly intelligent people being brainwashed by the Q cult. My hope is that once the election is over and (if social media sites keep banning Q content) that many of the brainwashed people will start to slowly wake up to reality. 

Maybe try reaching out as a friend and talk about neutral topics. My best friend “took the red pill” and she and I have had many debates, times of not speaking. She thinks I’m brainwashed by the Reptilian Rothschilds or something. Anyway,  finally I gave up talking any sort of politics with her. But, we still talk. I make it a point to send her positive memes and posts and just let her know she always has a friend in me (even if she is batshit crazy right now). 

Thing is, most people don’t like to admit when they have been brainwashed or taken in by a scam or a lie. I don’t think my friend will ever have that ah ha moment with me where she admits she was conned. But, I do think that little by little as time goes by, she will find her real self again. And, I just want to leave that door of friendship open, to help her find someone not in the Q cult to talk to if she needs to.  

I’m sorry you are going through this, and please know that none of the things you did or said led him further down the Q path. That’s the path he was going to go down anyway and that was his choice."

You've done the right thing as far as not getting sucked into it for the sake of maintaining your relationship, because it'd mean being around some shit people and you don't need that. In my experience, if you're comfortable with your opinion or position, then you should be comfortable enough to have it challenged or debated. Qanons, as I'm sure you've seen, want you to blindly believe the same shit they do without any discussion and quickly get shitty if you question any of their absurd beliefs. Qanon, cult much?"

$90,000. Minimum. For an interview with a public figure from 32 years ago.

2953,2020-10-08 23:43:36,j7l8y5,"That's pretty common from what I've seen. 

These editors talk a bit about it somewhere in their [presentation about the editing process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTY1sVRVSgY) of the NatGeo documentary Challenger Disaster: Lost Tapes. They received many archive clips, but the doc had to be structured around the budget. There's plugins that actually calculate a running tally of licensing costs to help editors with this. 

It's a good documentary though I don't know where you can watch it now. I love these archive footage only documentaries though. [LA 92](https://youtu.be/uaotkHlHJwo) was made by the same team and is excellent.

It's not just networks that throw up insane paywalls though. Museums, stock photo sites, libraries, institutions, and archives will often make you pay big bucks for a tiny piece of digital archive. Getty Images [licenses photos from 1901 for 500 bucks still](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/family-portrait-royalty-free-image/157675111). Doesn't matter if it's in the public domain, the physical media is owned by them and they made the digital copy so they can still license it. (I'm not super familiar with the details of this side of copyright law though)

I have digitized a lot of VHS, negatives, and slides myself, and I can say it is a *RIDICULOUS* amount of mind numbingly boring work that's easy to get wrong. I understand the bind smaller organizations have with handing out free copies of their materials when it took a lot of time to make that copy. *Everyone* is *always* dragging their feet on paying Archivists to do *anything*. Nobody will see 95% of the stuff they've digitized anyway because hardly anyone cares at all. One or two pieces of media will get displayed on social media, people will throw it a like during 15 seconds of their day, 8 researchers will stumble on some pieces over the course of 10 years, and the rest will just sit on a server there forever. 

But while I understand why paywalls are needed in many cases, they still leave a bitter taste in my mouth. It's just another gate for a curious person to navigate. If someone manages to find their way through a 10 year old terribly designed digital asset management system at their local archives only to find a $75 licensing fee for anything more than a 640x820px preview... yeah that doesn't make research interesting at all. They're going to throw in the towel and move onto something easier, or they'll just use the crappy preview. It locks so much of the past to low digital qualities when the original media actually looked much better. 

Alright rant over lol"
2954,2020-10-08 23:44:47,j7l8y5,"Yep. I’m working on a documentary.  You can see why docs can cost so much. They have some magic pricing formula that is “network or streaming/region to air/years to license. “

2958,2020-10-09 07:32:35,j7l8y5,Honestly the fact that it is so obscure justifies the price. If the studios keep every minute that Oprah recorded that's a lot of warehouses full of Betamax tapes. If there are duplicates it just magnifies the problem. No one then would think Trump would be president any more than any of her other guests and a big bounty would have to exist to justify keeping that much tape intact for decades.

2960,2020-10-09 15:05:08,j7l8y5,"But you don’t have to pay to license to get a proxy (watermarked viewing copy).  It’ll likely be a much lower price.

2969,2020-10-09 14:36:45,j7l8y5,"This is not the right issue, but [Amazon has one of these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1879762005). Like you said, it looks like it's just the index.

> If Americans get most of their news from television, it's unfortunate that programs vanish after broadcast. Transcript/Video Index ( TVI ) rectifies this somewhat. It indexes more than 50 news/public affairs shows from the networks, PBS, cable, and syndication. The catch is that those represented are only the ones transcribed by the publisher, a New York firm which sells transcripts and selected videos. Included are Nightline , Nova , 60 Minutes , etc., but not the nightly network newscasts. The result is an uneasy combination of an index and product catalog. Programs are listed by 222 broad subject headings; this cries out for a proper index. Listings contain show name and number, date, title of transcript, and a brief description. One hopes more programs will be added to future editions, but this is nevertheless an affordable, informative testament to television's diversity. Especially recommended for libraries with video collections."

2972,2020-10-09 00:57:00,j7l8y5,"This may be eyerollingly naive and boneheaded, but Oprah certainly has no love for Donald Trump, if you could figure out a way to get the request in her hands, she has the muscle to make anything happen. 

I have, in a fit of frustration, sent messages to people
I have no real right to contact, CEOs of corporations, etc., and every once in a great while I manage to actually get to someone who reads it and acts on it.

I used to do grunt legal work on mega pharma lawsuits. Having read the in boxes of many mega CEOs is what lead me to the technique. If some poor person Who’s kid was sick because of the company and their stupid policies managed to get to the boss of bosses who felt this was bad optics, s$&@ got sorted! One example; the CEO of a pharmacy benefits management company had a VP pulled away from His vacation the Bahamas left his family behind, was picked up by the company jet and was in the bosses office in Tennessee less than 24 hours after the boss had a WTF reaction to a story he read in an email from someone who was shooting in the dark with e-mail addresses he pulled from public filings. That boss had the aggrieved gentleman’s kids meds on his doorstep, delivered by the VP responsible for the stupid policy, who was sent to apologize in person within hours. It was something amazing to read the development of via e-mail chain. 

So, why not send Oprah/her people/Steadman/whoever your story and request for a copy. Offer to donate the reward cash to the charity of her choice. She has a copy of can get one instantaneously.

Might work.

P.S. after getting a British comedy worthy runaround from Overstock.com in their early days I emailed the executive committee a low-hyperbole description of what transpired in my attempts to get a friend the birthday gift I sent her. It was late, and I felt like ai was SOL so what not try something silly. Fast forward to 3:00 am when the CEO of Overstock called me to apologize, promise to get it to her, and then talked to me for at least half an hour asking my opinion on how to make the company better. I had no idea who he was then, spent the first 10 minutes thinking som one was having fun at my tired expense. After a post-call stint looking him up, he is/was an unconventional thinker to say the least. This was pre-modern social media, I think he was honestly surprised to get my message. I give him great credit for taking the time to look In to it and follow up. If my recollection Is not polishing things with time She had her book the next day. Fingers crossed Oprah is reading this thread right now."

2977,2020-10-09 14:42:15,j7l8y5,"> Did seasons of Oprah ever get released on VHS, or some other form of media?

Season releases of television shows didn't hit it big until the advent of DVD. Say 1999 or 2000, maybe even later. Before that, some shows were available, but only the nerdiest of nerd shows. VHS was just a horrible format back in an era when the canonical television season was 26 episodes.

On top of that, Oprah was no weekly prime television show. It was a weekday daytime talk show following the Phil Donahue format. I'd guess that she was releasing as many as 150-200 shows per year (they'd get well-known guests for national controversies, but also lesser known ones from local controversies as well, and for some issues, there'd even be multiple episodes spread out over several weeks). It was an hour long show, with commercials clocking in at 45ish minutes.

That's just never going to be released commercially on VHS.

The shows often ended the credits with a little blurb saying where to mail in to get a copy of any particular episode, but you can imagine how often that ever happened. I'm sure some crank or nutcase probably asked for them once in awhile, and maybe nationally they'd get a couple dozen requests per year... but as I remember it the blurbs never said *how much* each cost either, I guess you'd only know on request."

Also someone else recently had a massive archive of advertising on vhs, might have tv shows as well, but spliced them off for only the ads. 

And finally, I'd message folks in the Chicago subreddit. There might be folks who where at that show in the audience. Many who go to shows as the audience back then definitely recorded the footage when it came out. Someone might have the vhs somewhere!

3007,2020-10-09 16:24:17,j7l8y5,yea you would think that but that isn't necessarily the case especially in a time when storage was insanely expensive and took up a ton of space. Many of these smaller local news channels didn't have the money to keep all their old stuff so they destroyed it. Happened all the time. Just like the BBC (which wasn't a small news studio even back then) deleting their archives which has led to almost 100 episodes of Dr. Who being erased from history most likely.

3025,2020-10-09 00:44:00,j7l8y5,"> who have digitised it all

I'm pretty sure it's a long way from done. They have the tapes, but last I checked not enough funding has been allocated to finish it."
3026,2020-10-09 03:24:33,j7l8y5,I dabble.
3027,2021-01-19 07:53:25,j7l8y5,"Curious... Did you ever find the episode? Is the request still up?

(I don't have any info, I'm just curious)"
3028,2020-10-09 00:42:35,j7l8y5,sorry my comment was in response to that 3rd reddit link. Went down a deep hole with to many tabs open and forgot where i was.
3029,2020-10-09 01:16:01,j7l8y5,"Thanks for posting that link to the editing presentation. I’m about to watch it since it may help me with my current project. 

Do you happen to remember the names of any of those footage cost tracking plugins? That may make my life easier."
3030,2020-10-09 13:15:36,j7l8y5,Fuck Getty Images in the most brutal way you can imagine.
3031,2020-10-09 14:55:37,j7l8y5,">Doesn't matter if it's in the public domain, the physical media is owned by them and they made the digital copy so they can still license it.

They may have physical possession of it. I may have to pay to get my hands on it. They can ""license"" it all they want. If it's public domain I can take the the image and copy/scan/print and ""license"" it out myself. 

Bridgeman v. Corel says I can. 

Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp., 36 F. Supp. 2d 191 (S.D.N.Y. 1999), was a decision by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, which ruled that exact photographic copies of public domain images could not be protected by copyright in the United States because the copies lack originality."
3032,2020-10-09 02:07:17,j7l8y5,Totally agree with you on LA92. These are the best types of documentaries
3033,2020-10-09 02:49:16,j7l8y5,">It's not just networks that throw up insane paywalls though. Museums, stock photo sites, libraries, institutions, and archives will often make you pay big bucks for a tiny piece of digital archive. Getty Images licenses photos from 1901 for 500 bucks still. Doesn't matter if it's in the public domain, the physical media is owned by them and they made the digital copy so they can still license it. (I'm not super familiar with the details of this side of copyright law though)

They are free to charge whatever they want for public domain media.  Just like Random House can charge whatever they want to reprint *Moby Dick*.  What they can't do is stop you from redistributing your own copies of whatever you buy.

As for recent stuff, authors ""should"" be placing a copy on file with the Library of Congress when registering their copyright.  (Registration isn't mandatory, post 1976, but it is the first step if you ever wanna sue for statutory damages).  So in theory, we are -- or at least could be -- collectively funding the important work of Archivists and preservation through our tax dollars."
3034,2020-10-09 16:07:41,j7l8y5,"As someone who is currently working on a multi million dollar archiving project, those licensing fees exist because orgs need to recoup the cost of digitizing assets. As you said in a mass archive only a few things will ever probably be relevant, licensing of those assets pays for the archiving of the remaining assets that would be lost to time on a medium soon forgotten. You would think datahoarders would appreciate orgs trying to save all the data not just the stuff that seems externally relevant at the time."
3035,2020-10-09 11:28:23,j7l8y5,"The bit about the archive footage only documentaries. You have any recommendations in that regard? A company or is there agenre name for those in particular? 

I remember seeing ads for what looked like thst type of stuff back in the day but not since.  Id love to watch old archive videos."
3036,2020-10-10 16:45:23,j7l8y5,Paywalls are actually not needed. See Kinsella's: Against Intellectual Property
3037,2020-10-20 17:44:54,j7l8y5,"I feel this. Thanks for sharing your very articulate observations, it's not a rant imo"
3038,2020-10-09 07:16:56,j7l8y5,Have the chap from BP in South Park at the end saying “Suh-reee”.
3039,2020-10-08 23:52:13,j7l8y5,"That takes it from a low end of $180,000 to a high end of $312,000.

That costs *literally* more than my house. For one clip."
3040,2020-10-09 14:57:44,j7l8y5,"Sort of, but this is a Library of Congress failing IMO.  They exist as an archive of media, but have been relegated to an archive of just old books due to corporate lobbying (media companies, academic journals want exclusive control of ""their"" assets)."

3048,2020-10-08 22:45:26,j7l8y5,"Sure, but The Oprah Winfrey Show was syndicated, so it was up to each individual station where to put it in their schedule. The time of day completely depends on what station /u/ethanjscott is pulling from."

3055,2020-10-08 22:25:41,j7l8y5,He's posted this before and apparently something happened or someone said something on the episode according to him but OP won't say what it was and the threads derail into politics and get locked.
3056,2020-10-09 04:14:10,j7l8y5,"I’m with OP I remember sitting in my bedroom late at night scrolling Reddit as usual and I watched the interview in 2015 at least a clip of it & Oprah asked Trump if he would run for president and at first he declined and said something along the lines of ‘politics is not really his thing’ & also paraphrasing ‘but if I were to run I would run as a Republican because you know what Republicans are the most gullible group of people I’ve ever seen’. 

It was the next year or so I saw it in r/WhiteWhale where others were searching for it. I thought maybe these people just couldn’t use Google and I tried searching for the clip myself. Never to be seen again."
3057,2020-10-10 09:50:52,j7l8y5,"I was thinking the same, $1000 does seem suspiciously large.

I don't think $200k to license a 40 minute episode would hurt them too much given that the show doesn't require the cost of say a drama to produce. That's why they can throw money at absurd things like this."
3074,2020-10-10 05:38:19,j7l8y5,"I probably would, but I still wouldn't have any reasons to. There are a lot of deleted tweets/comments by Trump that people has forgotten. There was one where Trump tweeted to not vote for Obama just because of the war going on in middle east just to get re-elected when Trump went and did just that. There a lot of posturing, but the sadder news? There still not a lot of shits being done, and all Trump done is either hurt himself or shown that he doesn't care, as long as someone is profitting from it, and in turn, he is."

3076,2020-10-09 07:25:46,j7l8y5,That used to piss me off.   It took me a couple years to see all of the Duck Tales episodes.  The first 5 episodes took forever for me to see in order.
3077,2020-10-09 15:02:25,j7l8y5,"We had an entire closet dedicated to organizing our VHS and Betamax tapes with a handwritten index. Each tape had a bright circular sticker and code on it to match with the index book, and the titles were handwritten on the 3-4 lines going down the sticker spine. 

My mother would pay for HBO or Showtime for a while, record a bunch of content, then cancel it so we would always have commercial-free movies. Of course she was recording anything and everything (still does too), including all our home videos and that time she was interviewed by the local TV station. I wasn't an adult in that era, but it's where I got my interest in digital archiving. My mother was also the person who taped the first season of The Office as it aired, transferred to DVD-R, then mailed each episode to me during my first year off at school. Thankfully I got my finger on the pulse of online digital media sources shortly after, but I was very appreciative at the time!"

3079,2020-10-09 11:34:30,j7l8y5,"That's just idiotic logic.  There are more Oprah episodes NOT available (in the anniversary collection or elsewhere) than there are available.  Is it some grand conspiracy that these are missing as well?

There were over 4,500 episodes made, how many of those do you think you could track down? Pre-2000 no one was capping TV episodes and uploading them, and this episode aired in 1988.  Go look for any of the dumb talk shows from the early 90's, you'll find huge numbers that you cant find anywhere."
3080,2020-10-09 03:44:12,j7l8y5,a proper archive of the late 90’s early 00’s alt.binaries.tv(?) should have these episodes as they aired out of Chicago. I remember some asshole spamming recorded Oprah shows on the daily back then.

You'll be able to tell you're in the right neighborhood because a lot changed between 1988 and 1998.

I do *greatly* appreciate the work done to preserve history into the future, and the large sums of money and time sunk to do that. 

My critique comes from my desire to see high quality digital assets be more easily accessible. Warm and fuzzy goals I try to aspire to in my own amateur archive projects, but that I strongly recognize is not always practical or realistic in the real world. So I'm willing to concede the point 🤷‍♂️

That sounds like an interesting project though, what kind of media are you guys working on?"

Today he seems to be an old, slow and confused man ranting desperately trying to hold on to power. It's fucking sad that he's even running. Use the 25th..."

3136,2020-10-24 09:19:05,j7l8y5,"When you pay a company to access their public domain material that is unavailable elsewhere you are not entering into a licensing arrangement in the usual sense. You are entering into a contract with them, and that contract stipulates what you may and may not use the material for.

You are correct, that is the same logic the American medical system uses but that isn’t a fair comparison in this case. Medical care is a need, access to an old news clip is not, most people who are licensing a old news clip are doing so to use in some project they are going to use to make money. In the case of the archive I am working on viewing it does not cost money. Using a clip does. I’m not sure why there is a problem with that."

Unfortunately, this tape has not been digitized. Also, we are still working from home and don’t have access to the tape. So, I am not able to view the tape. However, we might be able to send the tape out to our vendor if you request digitization.  

> If the program that you mentioned is not a news episode and aired live, **there is a good chance that WMAR station did not record it**. I encourage you to contact WMAR station as well to see if they know the name of the program or if they have the footage there.

Has anyone digitized People magazine yet? 1998 isn't too long ago, and People is a fairly big title; even if there isn't a digital archive, I bet the Atlanta Library still has a copy stored somewhere.

It wouldn't be that hard to check ~52 issues to see if there's an interview with Donald Trump in one and if he said that quote. Of course, that's assuming the central branch has reopened, which I'm not sure of."

3206,2020-10-09 07:19:19,j7l8y5,"My white whale is when the Rolling Stones were on 60 minutes in 1994.  There is a clip where Ed Bradley and Mick are in a 2nd line in New Orleans having fun.  Ed narrates the clip and said something to the effect of ""I got a feeling Mick got to just be himself that day and might not have been recognized"", then Ed says something to Mick like ""That was good for you wasn't it?"" and Mick kind of pauses and says ""yeah, it was"".

The [clip of the segment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8c8M_fS7ec4&t=395s) on youtube has the 2nd line, but not the part I distinctly remember happening.  Possibly the one on YouTube is a rerun/syndicated clip which were always cut down from their original airings."

3211,2020-10-09 01:54:32,j7l8y5,The studies around 9/11 were what sent me down the rabbit hole. I am one of those people that’s very confident in where I was and what I was doing on 9/11 and reading the research tells me that I’m most likely wrong. It’s weird having part of your brain know you’re probably wrong and the other part absolutely sure of what happened.
3212,2020-10-09 01:52:44,j7l8y5,Researchers have observed the same kinds of false memories across individuals for the same event though. Google “Do you remember proposing to a Pepsi machine?” and read the study. It’s fascinating to see so many people form similar distorted memories from the same event.

3219,2020-10-09 17:09:58,j7l8y5,How do you know you're not just one of the countless people in the study who are just as sure about their memory as you are? They all tell similar stories and are sure they are correct. Some of the people in some of the studies went as far as denying they ever wrote their initial account of where they were and what they were doing. How do you know you're not one of those people?
3220,2020-10-09 02:01:53,j7l8y5,"I guess I would be curious why you would place so much certainty in a memory if you are aware of their unreliability, especially the unreliability of memories we feel certain about. Often those memories we are most certain about are proven to be the most unreliable."

3222,2020-10-09 17:49:10,j7l8y5,"With your wording it seems like the answer you're wanting from me is 'I can never be 100% sure about a memory unless I have verifiable proof, preferably video recording of me during the event of that memory' but I don't think that's realistic.

I'm not saying I'm a savant or I have a photographic memory or anything like that, I simply think I have a really really good memory compared to most people.  In my normal life I'm constantly recalling things that my friends or gf cannot (both long and short term) and anytime there's proof I'm right.

I also function perfectly (and prefer) low sleep, and every substance I've tried (even common things like Caffeine) is extremely potent to me.  I wonder if there's a correlation"
3223,2020-10-09 02:12:53,j7l8y5,"I'd answer that, but I forget why.

🥁🥁🔔

Seriously though, I remember it because I was reminded, circa 2015, that I'd previously read Trump had said it some years before.

Trauma forms much more indelible memories, and that racist narcissist and his GSRM-phobic impeachment insurance have been an entire train of mini-traumas for me (and entire segments of the national and global populations) with nearly every action he's taken, inspired, attempted, and threatened in his campaign and time in office."

3226,2020-10-09 17:55:27,j7l8y5,"No, my only point is that we shouldn’t treat memory as reliable by default. It’s been shown to unreliable. It’s also been shown that there is a strong correlation between how sure people are of memories and those memories being incorrect. The fact that you would say something like “anytime there’s proof I’m right” sets off alarm bells for me. Claims like that are only justifiably believed if you have actually participated in studies on memory or set out to actually falsify your own claims."
3227,2020-10-09 02:19:15,j7l8y5,"Hopefully you’re not mistaking me for a Trump supporter because I hate the guy, but don’t you think that should give you extra caution around that memory? What you’re saying actually runs contrary to the studies I’ve read on memory. I got pretty into it a few years ago when hearing memories around religious experiences. As an example: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4337233/. I don’t remember finding much opposing that viewpoint but I would be really interested if there are studies out there offering one."

Thank you for following along and actually having an interest to look into it.  I'm extremely burnt out from years of trying to explain this that I have a bad attitude about it."

3230,2020-10-09 19:53:15,j7l8y5,"You have a very heavy lean towards anti-memory reliability, and while I agree there's studies and proof that shows witnesses of a crime or traumatic event *can* be completely wrong in their recollection, you must also try your best to step outside of your strong opinion and consider that some people do in fact have good, accurate memories.  I don't know why someone like me who admittedly doesn't have a *super human* memory (or an extremely bad one) would seek out a professional memory study.  You seem like a skeptical guy in general but try to understand I was merely chucking in my anecdote, I have nothing to gain by hoodwinking an internet stranger"
3231,2020-10-10 03:21:20,j7l8y5,"I see. I like the idea of radical open-mindedness. Only then can such matters be seriously considered.

I remember searching for this a long time ago. Creeps me out. I do think the evidence of how the video might be edited is a little week, but also. Why would there exist different copies? And have someone confirmed having it on VHS? More importantly, what kind of sick person spends a lot of time editing this into a happy film."
3232,2020-10-10 21:58:23,j7l8y5,[deleted]
3233,2020-10-10 00:08:27,j7l8y5,Anecdotes are pretty worthless when mountains of research all point in the same direction. The fact that you have self-assessed and determined you have a great memory also isn’t any kind of great evidence considering the prevalence of people who overestimate their abilities. This also has loads of research behind it (think Dunning Kruger effect).
3234,2020-10-10 03:39:07,j7l8y5,"There have been different versions of home releases of various movies over the years. Sometimes those releases follow what has turned into well-known television edits to make movies more wholesome.  If you follow the DVD and Laserdisc communities, these issues come up with the hardcore collectors. 

I don't know why someone would maliciously edit something like this.  

For further context, I saw this on VHS (slight possibility it was betamax?) in my office while working at the Girl Scouts of America ~25 years ago. I saw the box and the original tape it was on. There was nothing about the presentation or the person that brought it in to show us, to make me think it was not 100% legit. 

The swaying lump hanging from what appears to be a rope burned an image in my mind that I will never forget. Which is why I will argue adamantly about what I saw.  

If it was a backstage prank that got captured on film, then it's a glorious one that no one talks about."
3235,2020-10-10 00:24:27,j7l8y5,I read all of this. You're right. I could be misremembering. But I also commented several times (with date and time) on this particular video in 2015 when it was available. I don't usually text out of context like that.
3236,2020-10-10 04:02:07,j7l8y5,"Interesting. Indeed a glorious nasty prank if that is what it was. Also, this was close to a hundred years ago. People did much more crazy things than this. AKA WW2."
3237,2020-10-10 00:34:29,j7l8y5,"I 100% am not saying you’re misremembering. I am more pointing out the unreliability of memory and what I believe a sound epistemology would dictate. For example, I am 99% sure my car is going to start tomorrow morning. I’m familiar with my car, the reliability of the make/model, and I have thousands of examples of it starting in the past with very few of it not. I am justified in that belief IMO. When it comes to memory, I’m probably closer to 50-60% sure. Why? Because all of the evidence points to memory being very hit or miss. On top of that, there appears to be no reliable way to predict which of my memories are reliable and which aren’t. Worse still, it appears that memories that I am most sure of may actually be the most likely to be inaccurate. Unless someone can give me a way to definitively differentiate between my accurate and my inaccurate memories, I don’t really see a way past that 50-60% confidence."
3238,2020-10-10 03:11:02,j7l8y5,"I totally get you. There's even a type of OCD in which, e.g., murder is investigated and talked about on the news, and a person with this type of OCD might be scared if he was involved. The obsession of whether he was involved or not leads to confusion and could even make him conclude that he did commit it, even though, he didn't."

3297,2020-10-07 17:40:17,j6tpc7,"The Nazis studied American Jim Crow as well as our genocide of the American Indians as templates of disenfranchisement and mass murder. Not that we were their only inspo, they also studied the British death camps in Africa.

At the end of the day America was so flattered by the gesture that we invited them over to play with our new toys called the CIA and NASA because Stalin didn't invite us to their birthday party. :+)"

3302,2020-10-07 18:57:50,j6tpc7,Have you ever hung out with a holocaust survivor?
3303,2020-10-07 17:36:54,j6tpc7,"Umm...no.  The eugenics movement did start in American universities though and those professors were invited to Germany to teach eugenics there.

Most of the genocide in the US of native people occurred without contact because missionaries and explorers brought novel diseases that spread faster than the Europeans.  It was unintentional.  The native population had already been suffering huge declines for yet unknown reasons.  Europeans did kill and drive out the last of the natives physically, but this had nothing to do with Germany killing Jews, gypsies, Catholics, gays, the disabled, and political dissidents.  There were many offers and attempts to “civilize” and integrate natives into the new society and boarding schools were a huge part of that.  Hitler on the other hand just killed children."
3304,2020-10-07 18:24:14,j6tpc7,"Oh I don't dispute any of that. Was just changing ""for"" to ""from"" but I see it could go either way."
3305,2020-10-07 16:46:51,j6tpc7,Throw in our eugenics and it's surprising the Nazis went full Nazi first.

The United States may not have moved to a ""Final Solution"" but the Third Reich absolutely used the United States as a template for its caste system."
3310,2020-10-07 22:48:22,j6tpc7,What does that have to do with anything?
3311,2020-10-07 17:47:41,j6tpc7,"“The irony that lies in this situation is the fact that Adolf Hitler studied many of the United States’ policies implemented against American Indian people, as models for how he would deal with Jewish people. He studied the plans of Bosque Redondo, the concentration camp where over 8,000 Navajo men, women and children were sent after the Long Walk in 1864.”"
3312,2020-10-07 17:42:24,j6tpc7,Lol fucking american native genocide apologist. I said our genocide of indigenous people inspired hitler which is objectively true.
3313,2020-10-07 17:52:32,j6tpc7,"I didn’t mention eugenics, and when I refer to the american genocide of indigenous populations I am strictly referring to the part where we rounded them up and killed them."
3314,2020-10-07 22:50:34,j6tpc7,"Oh word. When you changed the for to a from, you were saying that the U.S' Jim Crow was derived from the Nazis and not the other way around. But yeah I guess you can say that it goes both ways since the US saw Hitler changing the game over there and decided to pick up some of his acolytes to show us how it's done."
3315,2020-10-07 17:02:27,j6tpc7,"it's not so surprisingly, sadly. the effect of america's racism has been buffeted by its cosmopolitanism to an extent, but we've been exporting our style of hatred to more vulnerable nations. hitler's antisemitism was directly inspired by a weird screed that henry ford distributed to his workers, in the US and abroad."
3316,2020-10-07 19:44:23,j6tpc7,"What really surprises me is that US fought against the discrimination of white people (Jews et al) while simultaneously discriminating against black people.

As if to say discrimination against blacks good, against whites bad"
3317,2020-10-07 19:45:17,j6tpc7,"What's funny shit American eugenics, it was the Christians that were against it and scientists pushing it. I'm skeptical it would work out that way again if it occurred in the 21st century."

Remember FDR put Americans in concentration camps during the war.  After the war the British and Americans did not free the Jews, we put them back in concentration camps for a time being.  The book Exodus tells that story, worth a read"
3321,2020-10-07 23:11:46,j6tpc7,I understood what you were getting at. I was asking the question semi-rhetorically because it's a nonsensical thing to bring up. Do you think the OP statement would be offensive to a Jewish person for some reason?

>Pushing back against scholarship that downplays the impact in Nazi Germany of the U.S. model of legal racism, Whitman marshals an array of evidence to support the likelihood **“that the Nuremberg Laws themselves reflect direct American influence**.” **As race law’s global leader, Whitman stresses, America provided the most obvious point of reference for the September 1933** ***Preußische Denkschrift*****, the Prussian Memorandum**, written by a legal team that included Roland Freisler, soon to emerge as the remarkably cruel president of the Nazi People’s Court. **American precedents also informed other crucial Nazi texts, including the** ***National Socialist Handbook for Law and Legislation*** **of 1934–35,** edited by the future governor-general of Poland, Hans Frank, who was later hung at Nuremberg. **A pivotal essay in that volume, Herbert Kier’s recommendations for race legislation, devoted a quarter of its pages to U.S. legislation—which went beyond segregation to include rules governing American Indians, citizenship criteria for Filipinos and Puerto Ricans as well as African Americans, immigration regulations, and prohibitions against miscegenation in some 30 states. No other country, not even South Africa, possessed a comparably developed set of relevant laws.**

&#x200B;

Nazi legal theory was inspired by US segregation policy:

&#x200B;

>Especially significant were the writings of the **German lawyer Heinrich Krieger, “the single most important figure in the Nazi assimilation of American race law,” who spent the 1933–34 academic year in Fayetteville** as an exchange student at the University of Arkansas School of Law. Seeking to deploy historical and legal knowledge in the service of Aryan racial purity, **Krieger studied a range of overseas race regimes, including contemporary South Africa, but discovered his foundation in American law**. His deeply researched writings about the United States began with articles in 1934, some concerning American Indians and others pursuing an overarching assessment of U.S. race legislation—each a precursor to his landmark 1936 book, *Das Rassenrecht in den Vereingten Staaten* (“Race Law in the United States”).

&#x200B;

This work was additionally impactful:

&#x200B;

>Whitman’s “smoking gun” is the transcript of a June 5, 1934, conference of leading **German lawyers gathered to exchange ideas about how best to operationalize a racist regime. The record reflects how the most extreme among them, who relied on Krieger’s synoptic scholarship, were especially drawn to American legal codes based on white supremacy.** The main conceptual idea was Freisler’s. Race, he argued, is a political construction. In both America and Germany, the importance and meaning of race for the most part had been determined less by scientific realities or social conventions than by political decisions enshrined in law.

&#x200B;

Hitler cites the US directly:

> Among recent books on Nazism, the one that may prove most disquieting for American readers is James Q. Whitman’s “[Hitler’s American Model: The United States and the Making of Nazi Race Law](https://www.amazon.com/Hitlers-American-Model-United-States/dp/0691172420/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)” (Princeton). On the cover, the inevitable swastika is flanked by two red stars. Whitman methodically explores how the Nazis took inspiration from American racism of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. **He notes that, in “Mein Kampf,” Hitler praises America as the one state that has made progress toward a primarily racial conception of citizenship, by “excluding certain races from naturalization.”**  

&#x200B;

> In 1928, **Hitler remarked, approvingly**, that white settlers in America had “gunned down the millions of redskins to a few hundred thousand.” W**hen he spoke of** ***Lebensraum*****, the German drive for “living space” in Eastern Europe, he often had America in mind.** 

And this isn't a particularly new point of view: 

>As for Hitler and America, the issue goes beyond such obvious suspects as Henry Ford and Charles Lindbergh. **Whitman’s “Hitler’s American Model,” with its comparative analysis of American and Nazi race law, joins such previous studies as Carroll Kakel’s “**[**The American West and the Nazi East**](https://www.amazon.com/American-West-Nazi-East-Interpretive/dp/1137352736/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1524495765&sr=1-1&keywords=The+American+West+and+the+Nazi+East+kakel)**,” a side-by-side discussion of Manifest Destiny and** ***Lebensraum;*** **and Stefan Kühl’s “**[**The Nazi Connection**](https://www.amazon.com/Nazi-Connection-Eugenics-American-Socialism/dp/0195149785/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1524495802&sr=1-1&keywords=The+Nazi+Connection+kuhl)**,” which describes the impact of the American eugenics movement on Nazi thinking**. This literature is provocative in tone and, at times, tendentious, but it engages in a necessary act of self-examination, of a kind that modern Germany has exemplified.

Also, don't don't be two in the hospital bed like that, that's not cool, don't do that unless you're a parent with a child. The second person is so much in the way, if something actually happens and you have to wiggle the secondary out of the bed without disturbing (horribly expensive) equipment and lines while keeping the actual patient that's in distress that costs you important time at best.

Healthcare providers have absolutely zero motive to torture you. Why would we lie about stopping necessary feeding, drugs, etc. if it would only bring you back to us with unmanaged symptoms? Why would we want to harm you when we could give you what you need and solve the problem? 
When the problem is that you’re deep in the throes of factitious disorder, somatic symptom disorder, malingering, etc, the providers become enemies because we represent the gate to what you want so badly. We are never the conscious villains- why would we be?"

I guess my procrastination deep dive for the night is looking more into that, I assumed she’s on Medicaid, and most states they only cover CGMS for Type I.

I'd be so embarrassed to do something like that for pain medication. Her stupid ass already had a family doctor that agreed to what she wanted. So now she's mad cuz she took her pain medication to fast for fun and got caught off for trying to get a refill at the hospital basically. Ass wipe hello! Do you not watch the news that the hospitals are putting a stop to pain medication use. She was better off waiting till the weekend ended to push her drug dealer doctor for another early refill.

3446,2020-11-09 08:39:30,jqpvqw,"Well, she can contact CNN, Dr. Phil, Ellen, The Doctors, Oprah, etc. if she wants. However, I don't think she's going to like what will happen when she does. It's pretty obvious she's pushed her ""awesome Drs."" too far, and if she treated the nurses with disdain during the last admission, this is most likely the cause of her being ""fired"" from a practice.

3461,2020-11-09 14:31:16,jqpvqw,"yeah the pictures are wild uncomfortable and creepy. i’m sure most of us have been in/had a loved one in hospital at some point just because people are kinda soft and easily injured, and i’m sure most of those who have experienced that, whether they were admitted or visiting, wanted some comfort from a loved one, and i’m also sure most of them confined it to holding hands or stroking someone’s hair or speaking quietly because that’s uhhhhh what’s appropriate in a goddamn hospital, not whatever those last two photos were. 

also like was it a timer or did someone take them? which is creepier?"

eta: i think i get what you mean, that she’s using them as “battle scars” almost, like they’re evidence of her struggle with mast cell disease, but they’re just from rapid weight gain. non-ott people have them and i’ve only seen ppl in the early body positive community (when they weren’t invaded with “health at every size” people) call them “battle scars”. a lot of stretch marks are due to recovery from malnutrition or eating disorders"
3463,2020-11-09 04:53:12,jqpvqw,"She has her Dexcom low alarm set at 80 for some reason. If you are monitoring a type 1 kid, on insulin, who drops quickly and won't tell you at all if they have symptoms or watch their own Dexcom, you set it at 80. Then you can have plenty of warning to treat before they have a severe low. If you're a competent adult with nothing better to do than watch your medical devices, setting it to 65 or 70 is fine."

Being unable to breath is one sign of anaphylaxis but isn't just it. Not going to blog but I have a bit of experience with it (not myself so I don't know what it feels like) and I know what it looks like and have had some training in it to know the signs and what to do.

A big part of it is prevention but she has all those animals around her which can't be good. If it is an anxiety attack then having the animals I can understand because they are very soothing even if you have a mild allergy to them sometimes that can be still worth having a pet."
3475,2020-11-10 12:56:14,jqpvqw,"Honestly, I was reading through this and thought “so you’re dying cause they won’t give you opiates”

Last I checked narcotics aren’t a treatment for MCAS or whatever the hell she claims to have"
3476,2020-11-15 16:47:30,jqpvqw,"It doesn’t. She’s probably going through withdrawals and doesn’t want to admit it. Anaphylaxis is a pretty common condition a lot of people have, to lie about something that there is so much available information for the general public on just goes to show how delusional she is."
3477,2021-02-06 12:38:57,jqpvqw,"This is an old comment, I know, but pain can trigger mast cells to degranulate and thus cause a mast cell reaction or full on anaphylaxis.  MCAS triggers aren't just food, drugs, smells....they can literally be anything, like pain, strong emotions (good and bad!), vibrations, heat or cold...  Anything that upsets your body's usual homeostasis is fair game for causing a mast cell reaction."
3478,2020-11-09 07:13:40,jqpvqw,"To say that her writing is 'amateur at best' almost misleading when you consider how bad it all sounds together. It's like she can't hammer out a post that actually flows, so we get the draft fragments instead."
3479,2020-11-09 15:01:48,jqpvqw,she uses the bread crumb thing all the time!!
3480,2020-11-09 20:37:55,jqpvqw,"HOW VERY DARE YOU. Writing is the only thing she can do, dammit ... at least until she can get off her ass on pain meds again like how she's meant to be.

&#x200B;

\*said in jest"
3481,2020-11-09 23:45:25,jqpvqw,"she says she told them she didn’t want iv meds anymore. I’m like if you’re really in 10/10 pain, then you FOR SURE are going to want iv pain meds"
3482,2020-11-09 06:04:59,jqpvqw,"Yes, it’s a perfect BG! And the arrow (—>) on the Dexcom means that it’s staying steady. A down arrow would suggest “plummeting”."
3483,2020-11-09 13:22:11,jqpvqw,"exactly. in her post she said, “my stretch marks were EVEN MORE prominent” meaning they existed prior to this. there are so many times (in various groups) where someone will post a picture and caption it “i’m soooo bloated and swollen” and it’s literally just fat. there’s a difference between the two that apparently these people don’t know about."
3484,2020-11-09 19:46:22,jqpvqw,"In addition, being told you’re not as sick as you think you are is not trauma!"
3485,2020-11-09 03:51:32,jqpvqw,"Nope! Surprisingly there’s never been a video made. Crazy since she uses 20+ epi pens a month! What she thinks is a reaction is actually anxiety. Her explanation and her discharge details don’t tell the same story, and I’m inclined to believe that of the specialist. I’m surprised they kept her in that long while not seeing her reported symptoms."
3486,2020-11-09 07:25:51,jqpvqw,"Not to kinkshame, but this really seems like a kink that doubles as internet narcissism. And that first pic with her tongue out is, uh, something."
3487,2020-11-09 18:59:59,jqpvqw,Those pictures out of context look like birth. Sick people in the hospital don’t cuddle in odd posed positions. Maybe laying next to each other but not climbing all over shit. Only in L&D have I seen people sit around like this.
3488,2020-11-09 15:33:17,jqpvqw,"Diabetic here....her glucose looked fine for what she showed us, and actually showed her trend as steady per her Dexcom."
3489,2020-11-10 11:45:08,jqpvqw,I too thought the use of that word was very extreme and unnecessary.
3490,2020-11-11 04:26:35,jqpvqw,I came here to say this
3491,2020-11-14 16:37:28,jqpvqw,"Nah, send her to Dr. Now. He'll have her losing turdy lbs in 1 munt 😎"
3492,2020-11-10 15:06:24,jqpvqw,"Oh my god, YESSSSSSSS"
3493,2020-11-11 04:42:37,jqpvqw,or maybe Doctor Oz?
3494,2020-11-09 23:38:59,jqpvqw,I couldn’t figure out if she meant pain gave her anaphylaxis or if she was vascillating from pain to anaphylaxis
3495,2020-11-15 21:48:16,jqpvqw,"No.  There is no going in and out of anaphylaxis.  The symptoms of anaphylaxis can be so life-threatening that going in and out of shock like that would be, as the doctors say, ""Not compatible with life.""  It is possible to be exposed to a trigger and have anaphylactic symptoms a few hours later, though.  (I know this because my older sister is a Munchie and she has been doing this for years.  I haven't seen nor spoken to her in 12 years but I hear through other family members that she's still doctor shopping and causing her own injuries for pain meds & attention)"
3496,2020-11-12 14:51:50,jqpvqw,"So, will it be two or three books you'll be writing about it, then? ;-)"
3497,2020-11-09 04:43:10,jqpvqw,Something is just off with their whole dynamic. She has pictures of him bringing his own stethoscope to use on her while she is inpatient and has made several posts and comments how she wakes up to him giving her iv meds or wakes up to the taste of the flush after hes pushed them while she is asleep.
3498,2020-11-09 08:16:28,jqpvqw,"That’s what I’m trying to figure out, who tf took these cringy photos."
3499,2020-11-09 08:15:48,jqpvqw,Tripod and camera set with a timer.
3500,2020-11-09 13:48:28,jqpvqw,"Yup. And she's allergic to not getting drugs. My adding was like that too. I think the rehab people called it ""withdrawl"""
3501,2020-11-09 14:07:57,jqpvqw,Lol that was my first thought. She must think anaphylaxis is something she can just will herself into to get drugs
3502,2020-11-09 15:43:53,jqpvqw,My exact question. Are her teeth missing? Why?
3503,2020-11-09 15:04:02,jqpvqw,she just makes up shit as she goes along
3504,2020-11-09 18:42:57,jqpvqw,The normal treatment is mast cell stabilizers. Her claims don’t make sense. Reactions can be mild to severe never heard of swelling from mast cell. She’s a huge problem because she claims to “advocate” for the condition. All she does is make patients seem unstable
3505,2020-11-10 00:27:26,jqpvqw,"Exactly. All of the illness fakers piss me off, but she’s one of the fucking worst. Mostly because it’s so obvious she’s attention seeking and doesn’t have the majority the issues she claims to have - and the ones she might have she’s exaggerating for dramatics and attention."
3506,2020-11-10 01:07:56,jqpvqw,I think she may have upped the contrast/filter to make them appear more violent. She did say that she gained 100 pounds in 6 months... gaining a half a pound a day on average will definitely leave brutal marks on the body.
3507,2020-11-10 18:06:39,jqpvqw,When you gain weight this rapidly your skin stretches so fast itll bleed.
3508,2020-11-10 18:05:29,jqpvqw,[removed]
3509,2020-11-09 06:11:58,jqpvqw,Same but mine is from the pain of reading this malarkey.
3510,2020-11-09 04:55:42,jqpvqw,And SGB levels of dramatics.
3511,2020-11-09 07:08:50,jqpvqw,Notice she didn’t say dr Phil where he’s been known to call out munchies before
3512,2020-11-10 01:01:21,jqpvqw,You are SHO right on that last part.
3513,2020-11-09 16:15:33,jqpvqw,The stress from it can cause MCAS reactions AFAIK.
3514,2020-11-09 17:37:30,jqpvqw,You don’t just go into anaphylactic shock because of pain either. It’s a severe allergic reaction. I have no idea what she think it is but I would love to hear this story from the doctors perspective.
3515,2020-11-09 03:57:06,jqpvqw,"She also says her blood pressure skyrockets with her MCAS symptoms... interesting,  cause anaphylaxis drops the blood pressure. She must just have a special case of withdrawal-induced anaphylaxis."
3516,2020-11-09 04:15:22,jqpvqw,I always thought blood sugar rose when someone was under stress or in pain.
3517,2020-11-09 05:36:29,jqpvqw,"Yes atleast for me withdrawal causes my face to flush and feel hot, sweaty and cold all at once."
3518,2020-11-09 11:01:53,jqpvqw,[removed]
3519,2020-11-09 17:49:59,jqpvqw,That pic of him holding her is remiscent of someone in full blown labor and I can't even
3520,2020-11-09 16:45:11,jqpvqw,I think she's in denial
3521,2020-11-09 22:00:53,jqpvqw,She has to know she's fat but won't admit it
3522,2020-11-09 18:53:25,jqpvqw,Same. Also I've never known a hospital that let's other people use the same bed as the patient. It's generally a big no - no.
3523,2020-11-10 05:10:59,jqpvqw,Omg can you imagine looking at this racket from the hallway as a nurse or something lol
3524,2020-11-09 19:54:01,jqpvqw,Who is taking the picture of her and her partner?
3525,2020-11-09 05:37:47,jqpvqw,In certain places around the world disabled children are seen as demons that need to be- *taken care of*. I would argue that that is a systematic genocide of disabled people. Not getting the meds and ~special treatment~ you want because the doctors have finally gotten sick of your bullshit? Not genocide- not even close.
3526,2020-11-09 05:28:42,jqpvqw,"I’m not sure she knows what “systematic” or “genocide” really mean. Or anaphylaxis, or swelling, or hives..."
3527,2020-11-09 04:51:37,jqpvqw,I mean if anything she’s going to munch herself to death and everyone will blame it on the system
3528,2020-11-09 04:30:25,jqpvqw,That one took me out.
3529,2020-11-09 05:24:13,jqpvqw,Actually Jacquie was claiming that it was happening to her and the doctor enabled her by giving her a pca. Then she died a few days later. The theory is that either the doctors didn't believe her (because she kept whining and faking anaphylactic reactions) or that the pca masked the pain until it was too late.
3530,2020-11-09 07:19:04,jqpvqw,"You mean besides a fat malpractice lawsuit? .. Joy, probably. I bet doctors secretly finds it fulfilling to go to school for well over a decade, all to make patients cry and doodle erect penises on people's charts at random. (Right after they go around randomly pulling cords out of the wall in ICU during rounds, of course.) /s"
3531,2020-11-09 14:16:28,jqpvqw,"Right? If they had “standing orders” for pain meds, everyone would try to get themselves admitted."
3532,2020-11-09 14:06:39,jqpvqw,I would love to see that
3533,2020-11-09 15:18:08,jqpvqw,I was thinking more Jerry Springer
3534,2020-11-09 20:00:38,jqpvqw,"I was thinking if she aimed for TLC, Dr Now might be interested in featuring her!"
3535,2020-11-09 17:18:41,jqpvqw,"Bethany is 23 years old. She was born in 1997.
I’m not sure about her teeth, but I was shocked about her age."
3536,2020-11-09 17:48:58,jqpvqw,"She has her teeth, she just somehow thought this was a good photo to post online."
3537,2020-11-09 09:51:57,jqpvqw,"The anaphylaxis because of pain part killed me lol. It doesn't work that way, Bethany."
3538,2020-11-09 04:48:16,jqpvqw,Bordering?  She's well over morbidly obese

3543,2020-11-09 19:44:48,jqpvqw,"He likes to cosplay as her nurse or doctor, complete with auscultating her chest! He gives her IV meds while she’s sleeping. It’s like that one guy on my 600lb life that was bedbound (truly) and his girlfriend was bringing him stuff, encouraging his killing himself! He gets his kicks off of her needing him."
3544,2020-11-09 19:00:35,jqpvqw,She also lives with her mom.
3545,2020-11-09 20:17:21,jqpvqw,"She can, she just doesn't WANT TO ... unless it's McFlurries or M&Ms in regards to food."
3546,2020-11-09 03:35:53,jqpvqw,So technically (from my understanding) anaphylaxis is not always a life threatening allergic reaction. It is just an allergic reaction that involves multiple systems of the body. Anaphylaxis shock however is always a life threatening emergency.

3550,2020-11-09 15:41:41,jqpvqw,Right? It’s only the body parts we can’t see that are swollen. Unless they have some super powers where they can target specific body parts to swell.
3551,2020-11-09 20:48:51,jqpvqw,Yes! I was wondering that too! If you have 100 pounds of fluid wouldn't your eyes be at least somewhat swollen shut?
3552,2020-11-18 00:25:59,jqpvqw,"No, crotch-shot Bethany does not own pants. Only tees and knee socks."
3553,2020-11-09 05:38:59,jqpvqw,Thanks for doing the conversion.

3565,2020-11-10 00:56:41,jqpvqw,"This!!! When you’re in a shit ton of pain, you’re usually trying to find a position that doesn’t make you feel like you’re dying, passing out, or vomiting. 

How is it that the people who least need pain meds are the ones who get it with no problem?? I guess fuck the rest of us for being honest about our pain and conditions??

Also, congrats on being clean. Seriously, that’s a fucking great achievement and I have a lot of respect for ex addicts (my dad was one, I’ve seen the struggle firsthand)."

3570,2020-11-09 14:14:41,jqpvqw,No. I’ve never seen that. Never heard of that. She clearly doesn’t know what anaphylaxis is.
3571,2020-11-09 17:10:29,jqpvqw,"No, it is absolutely not possible to go into anaphylaxis from pain."
3572,2020-11-17 05:52:46,jqpvqw,"Does she have mast cell whatever? Cause I think I heard (not sure) that that's like an allergic reaction, but not the same and it can be worsened by extreme emotions or sensations. But I'm pretty sure you can't be allergic to pain lol. 
Again, not a doctor, but just something I heard about."

3576,2020-11-09 08:49:52,jqpvqw,Exactly this.  She's not being given insulin (I hope) so there's no need to have it set so high.

3581,2020-11-09 09:21:53,jqpvqw,"I think you are right. Anaphylaxis is scary - there’s a point where a thought flashes through the mind of ‘I’m fucked’.  I can see why someone with a panic attack can believe they are having an anaphylactic reaction. That said, heaping adrenaline onto a panic attack will not help one bit."
3582,2020-11-09 04:23:15,jqpvqw,"Yea could be panic attacks or just withdrawal panic. Especially at the beginning, withdrawal has a ton of anxiety and panic."
3583,2020-11-09 06:16:14,jqpvqw,Yeah she's got an obvious case of Anxiphylaxis.
3584,2020-11-09 08:14:51,jqpvqw,"Agreed. I think she legitimately believes she is ill when her anxiety is what is causing most of the symptoms. Every time she has a panic attack she assumes its anaphylaxis and life threatening. That's why she uses so many epipens. Then because she thinks is life threatening, she becomes even more anxious and afraid, causing more symptoms. It's like she's in a different category than the other subjects. 

She's one of the few subjects that I think would greatly improve if she could get inpatient psych help for 4-8 weeks. I think she needs some sort of exposure therapy, so she can get rid of the belief that she's constantly at risk of dying. I feel sorry for her in a way, because I really dont think she wants to munch, it's just a byproduct of her anxiety. 

The problem though is that she'll never make progress unless she begins to understand that her anxiety has a large root in this. So many chronic illness/pain patients get told it's in their head at some point, and it's seems like everyone automatically gets defensive and refuses to even acknowledge it. If someone suggests therapy, especially if you can afford/subsudize/get insurance to pay for it, what's the harm in trying the psychiatric route? The worse that can happen is your wrong and you feel better. And I'm not talking one session a month, I mean dedicated work to improve your existence."
3585,2020-11-09 13:37:34,jqpvqw,"She's literally already been told by doctors.  She had a whole thing where she learned she learned and accepted that her illness was psychosomatic.  
   
She is a pure munch.  She knows she doesn't have shit."
3586,2020-11-09 17:17:44,jqpvqw,Maybe that could make sense the first time but after years and tons of doctors telling her she is not ‘in and out of anaphylaxis’ she is choosing to believe what she wants and choosing to medicate a non-existent problem bc she likes it.
3587,2020-11-09 16:49:41,jqpvqw,Really? I don't know if I've ever noticed before. Probably because my eyes glaze over every time I try to read one of her rejected-YA-novels of a post.
3588,2020-11-09 07:29:00,jqpvqw,"Also why is her lower limit set at 80? No wonder her dex graph looks like she’s “going low”. She is likely just below 80, i.e. not low."

3590,2020-11-09 04:52:33,jqpvqw,Honestly I think it was to try and get her back to a normal life. Like convincing her to walk and eat real food etc
3591,2020-11-09 08:55:02,jqpvqw,"Maybe they kept her for as long as they did just to see what type of issues she'd try to create or insist on? It's shocking that they kept her for two weeks IMO. Maybe this was done so that the doctor had plenty of documented B.S. to throw at her when she was removed from the Doctor's practice. I think this is why she is so upset. She was discharged with a small amount of opiates, and her other ""accessories"" were cancelled, and it seems that she didn't know that these changes were in the works until she returned home.

Yes, I think it's time to call CNN, Ellen or Oprah for sure. Maybe Oprah will gift her a years worth of WW to help her out."
3592,2020-11-09 18:26:03,jqpvqw,"the trend looked good.

3603,2020-11-09 20:47:43,jqpvqw,She has all her teeth. I think she was trying to look cutesy and do a babyish all gums smile.
3604,2020-11-09 20:04:48,jqpvqw,I've never heard of anaphylaxis from pain either
3605,2020-11-10 14:51:15,jqpvqw,I just can't believe people let themselves get like this just for some attention. They need serious mental help not drugs because all seem to be addicted.
3606,2020-11-15 21:35:00,jqpvqw,Gained 100lbs in 6 months?!  JFC was she taking steroids to keep her hungry so should could keep eating?  Prednisone is a bitch that way.  Some of her complaints sound similar to Congestive Heart Failure which can be caused by an excessive amount of stress on the body which causes the kidneys to retain water which can also cause rapid weight gain but it's just water weight.  It's dangerous but there are treatment options.

3611,2020-11-09 06:06:24,jqpvqw,Sounds like her anaphylaxis has anaphylaxis!

3633,2020-11-09 07:01:46,jqpvqw,"By definition, an anaphylactic reaction involves two or more body systems. It can turn into anaphylactic shock, which is a real emergency.

I don't understand how any doctor would okay her injecting an Epipen multiple times a day without setting foot in the ER. Part of the patient education on anaphylaxis hammers into patients that if you use the epipen, you should head straight to the ER for further treatment. The Epipen doesn't resolve anaphylaxis, it just buys you time to get further treatment."
3634,2020-11-09 08:58:03,jqpvqw,Thanks for explaining this. It actually makes a lot more sense when phrased that way.
3635,2020-11-09 07:29:10,jqpvqw,"Plus TPN. So that’s oral, enteral, and parenteral nutrition. Most people eat one diet, she eats three at once, and this is why we don’t do that."
3636,2020-11-09 15:40:54,jqpvqw,The only time I think of highly processed foods being safe \[beyond formula designed for it\] would be like Dum Dum lollipops and other foods made without most major allergens. Most people with even typical food allergies can't go near a DQ. The door has a sign that most things probably have peanut cooties because of how they make things. Let alone dairy soy etc. The shared equipment nightmare of a blizzard seems unlikely she has super severe allergies.
3637,2020-11-09 06:09:28,jqpvqw,What are safe foods?
3638,2020-11-09 08:33:33,jqpvqw,"Steriods, her ""safe"" foods, (DQ Blizzards, McFlurries, Skittles) and tube feedings she obviously doesn't need, but to her, it's apparently water-weight which she terms as ""swelling""."

Where’s all the excitement/ happiness about being in the hospital?
From the looks of it, it seems as though the doctors she deals with finally had enough of her delusions and the 2wk hospital stay was to prove to her doctors that she is 99% bull sh*t. Hopefully she’ll have a difficult time finding another doctor to do what she wants due to her BS claims.

3653,2020-11-10 22:48:50,jqpvqw,"If she's not being given insulin then 1. why does she even have a Dexcom (not that its not a great tool but most people with type 2 don't get them), and 2. why would she freak out at anything thats not below 100? Most type 2s need to stay around 120, or so, but if you get to 106 or so its not an emergency. Talk to me when it gets to like 45, girly! 106 is OK even for a type 2. 🙄 Drama queen.

ETA: just using 45 as an actual low number constituting an ACTUAL emergency. 60 is a low number but 106 isn't!"
3654,2020-11-09 08:49:12,jqpvqw,"I think it's probably normal to maybe set it on 80 for a type I, especially if they have an insulin pump, because it's not their own body regulating insulin and so potentially more risk of hypoglycemia.  They try and stay between 80-100 I think.  Above 60 is normal. Most people won't have severe symptoms until it's lower than 45 or less."
3655,2020-11-09 08:53:48,jqpvqw,She did have a post that states she get anaphylaxis from the anxiety that surges when the phone rings. I wonder if you are on to something here.

3670,2020-11-09 20:26:53,jqpvqw,"Don’t think this is her case AT ALL, but it COULD drop if the stress is prolonged and she can still produce insulin. Basically, when maintaining a high “fight or flight” glucose, some people with “funky” endocrine systems can have a low when their body runs out of glycogen and has to rely only on gluconeogenesis. I’ve seen this happen with a combination of PTSD and an impaired insulin feedback response.

Again, probably not the case here, but an interesting fact to know"

Epipens wear off *quickly*.  If something is causing a systemic reaction, you need treatment immediately and the epipen is supposed to get you through until EMS or the ER can take over. 

Honestly though, if she's on systemic steroids, I'm not sure *how* anyone could think she is having allergic reactions.  It suppresses your immune system, which is the system that causes allergic reactions.  Reactions are literally *treated* with steroids."

If you stop steroids abruptly, you can go into an ""adrenal crisis"" because we need steroids in our bodies always to respond to ... well. Life.

Pain relief shouldnt make you pain free totally if it does your taking too much. Its aim is to reduce pain to managable levels. Rebound pain can be a total vicious cycle till you reduce your pain meds."

Edit 1: Wow, this really blew up! Thanks for the upvotes, kind strangers!

Edit 2: thanks for the gold kinda stranger I didn’t expect this post to blow up! My life started growing up in a small farm in northern Kansas. My father was a farmer and my mother was a cashier in our local town down the dirt road. We didn’t have much and income was very little, my best toy I got growing up was a pig bladder blown up like a balloon that I could play around with between me and my two brothers. At the age of 11 things started getting tougher in my house life due to my fathers drinking problem as it was not a good harvest that year. Like his father before him once he was done working he would come home and drink but unlike his father he wouldn’t beat us unless we messed up, his father left him and his mother to fend for themselves after world war 2 though so he had it tougher than me growing up. One time my father did drink too much and he hit my little brother Jamey. Jamey didn’t know what to do and ran away during the night during a storm. The entire family was out looking for him but we never saw Jamey again. This made my father drink more and lead him to take his life when I was at the age of 16. My older brother and me had to completely take over the farm with the help of our mom quitting her job as a cashier, life got very hard from here on out. We got a break when I was 18 with a good harvest we were able to save up some money. I was able to move out at the age of 21 and into a larger city in Tennessee. It was hard leaving the family as my ma was getting older but my older brother completely took over the farm and even expanded it into a more profitable work. I began working in what I was good at, repairing mechanics. I was a hard worker and moved up in my chain of work easily within my town. I dated aroun’ a bit but never settled down with anyone I would write home about for my first few years. When I was 26 I got a call from my ma, my brother was working with some machinery on the farm and got his hand caught in it and heavily damaged. I had to come home and help with the farm, at the time I had attained a high position as a senior mechanic within an auto shop and sometimes worked on the side with repairing electronics. I went home and had to help with the farm for a year, ma wasn’t doing good at all. She passed the next year due to kidney disease. My brother eventually recovered and I returned to Tennessee, I attempted to return to my position but due to the time I was out I had been long replaced. I had to begin to work from the bottom again when I had a client come in, she was the most beautiful woman I ever seen in Tennessee with gorgeous brown hair. Nice to say that we hit it off pretty well, within a few weeks we were dating. I can say that she was one of the best things to have happened to me in my life. At the age of 30 I married her and my first child was on the way then. I had returned to my previous position and bought a nice house near the mountains of Tennessee. At the age of 34 my second child was born. My two kids are now both in high school, one a freshman, another a Senior. I continued my career into more electronics working on computers and fixing them. In 2013 while googling how to fix a small problem with a motherboard I found a strange site named reddit.com, this website had all the answers I needed and a community always ready to help. I’ve been on the site ever since. As you can see recently, I commented on this thread and some kind stranger gave me gold. Thank you again kind stranger.

We got a break when I was 18 with a good harvest we were able to save up some money. I was able to move out at the age of 21 and into a larger city in Tennessee. It was hard leaving the family as my ma was getting older but my older brother completely took over the farm and even expanded it into a more profitable work. I began working in what I was good at, repairing mechanics. I was a hard worker and moved up in my chain of work easily within my town. I dated aroun’ a bit but never settled down with anyone I would write home about for my first few years. When I was 26 I got a call from my ma, my brother was working with some machinery on the farm and got his hand caught in it and heavily damaged. I had to come home and help with the farm, at the time I had attained a high position as a senior mechanic within an auto shop and sometimes worked on the side with repairing electronics. I went home and had to help with the farm for a year, ma wasn’t doing good at all. She passed the next year due to kidney disease. My brother eventually recovered and I returned to Tennessee, I attempted to return to my position but due to the time I was out I had been long replaced. I had to begin to work from the bottom again when I had a client come in, she was the most beautiful woman I ever seen in Tennessee with gorgeous brown hair. Nice to say that we hit it off pretty well, within a few weeks we were dating. I can say that she was one of the best things to have happened to me in my life. At the age of 30 I married her and my first child was on the way then. I had returned to my previous position and bought a nice house near the mountains of Tennessee. At the age of 34 my second child was born. My two kids are now both in high school, one a freshman, another a Senior. I continued my career into more electronics working on computers and fixing them. In 2013 while googling how to fix a small problem with a motherboard I found a strange site named reddit.com, this website had all the answers I needed and a community always ready to help. I’ve been on the site ever since. As you can see recently, I commented on this thread and some kind stranger gave me gold. Thank you again kind stranger.

I mean, there really is a lot of evidence of various nefarious wrongdoings (was really hoping trump was a Sagittarius, but naw...) committed by trump himself, or on the orders of him. And the whole, “sitting presidents can’t be indicted” loophole made up by Barr put a lot of investigations on hold.

So at least there’s a chance trump can end up in jail... kinda like how Epstein was in jail a decade ago, where he could still go to his work and house during the day, and really just had to sleep at a jail that would pass as a 3 star hotel, which trump would complain that the conditions of the place are deplorable.

That wasn't made up by Barr - the memo was written in '73. It was reaffirmed in 2000."

3836,2020-11-09 02:12:15,jq3ldq,"I guess the phrase made up was poorly chosen, you’re right. I’d never really heard this stance of not being able to indict presidents until this president, but it’s been brought up before, with Nixon and Clinton. 

It still stands that trump may have benefited a lot by Barr invoking that defense for him. Only time will tell if trump got a pass while being the president."
3837,2020-11-09 02:19:40,jq3ldq,"Mueller implied heavily the only reason he didn't go after Trump was the OLC memo, half-assed as his investigation turned out to be. Although it's very likely Barr would have dropped any case against Trump anyway once he took Sessions' place.   

We also pretty well already know Trump got a pass - he was the unindicted 'Individual 1' in the case that sent Michael Cohen to prison."

Edit 1: Wow, this really blew up! Thanks for the upvotes, kind strangers!

Edit 2: thanks for the gold kinda stranger I didn’t expect this post to blow up! My life started growing up in a small farm in northern Kansas. My father was a farmer and my mother was a cashier in our local town down the dirt road. We didn’t have much and income was very little, my best toy I got growing up was a pig bladder blown up like a balloon that I could play around with between me and my two brothers. At the age of 11 things started getting tougher in my house life due to my fathers drinking problem as it was not a good harvest that year. Like his father before him once he was done working he would come home and drink but unlike his father he wouldn’t beat us unless we messed up, his father left him and his mother to fend for themselves after world war 2 though so he had it tougher than me growing up. One time my father did drink too much and he hit my little brother Jamey. Jamey didn’t know what to do and ran away during the night during a storm. The entire family was out looking for him but we never saw Jamey again. This made my father drink more and lead him to take his life when I was at the age of 16. My older brother and me had to completely take over the farm with the help of our mom quitting her job as a cashier, life got very hard from here on out. We got a break when I was 18 with a good harvest we were able to save up some money. I was able to move out at the age of 21 and into a larger city in Tennessee. It was hard leaving the family as my ma was getting older but my older brother completely took over the farm and even expanded it into a more profitable work. I began working in what I was good at, repairing mechanics. I was a hard worker and moved up in my chain of work easily within my town. I dated aroun’ a bit but never settled down with anyone I would write home about for my first few years. When I was 26 I got a call from my ma, my brother was working with some machinery on the farm and got his hand caught in it and heavily damaged. I had to come home and help with the farm, at the time I had attained a high position as a senior mechanic within an auto shop and sometimes worked on the side with repairing electronics. I went home and had to help with the farm for a year, ma wasn’t doing good at all. She passed the next year due to kidney disease. My brother eventually recovered and I returned to Tennessee, I attempted to return to my position but due to the time I was out I had been long replaced. I had to begin to work from the bottom again when I had a client come in, she was the most beautiful woman I ever seen in Tennessee with gorgeous brown hair. Nice to say that we hit it off pretty well, within a few weeks we were dating. I can say that she was one of the best things to have happened to me in my life. At the age of 30 I married her and my first child was on the way then. I had returned to my previous position and bought a nice house near the mountains of Tennessee. At the age of 34 my second child was born. My two kids are now both in high school, one a freshman, another a Senior. I continued my career into more electronics working on computers and fixing them. In 2013 while googling how to fix a small problem with a motherboard I found a strange site named reddit.com, this website had all the answers I needed and a community always ready to help. I’ve been on the site ever since. As you can see recently, I commented on this thread and some kind stranger gave me gold. Thank you again kind stranger.

3858,2020-11-07 18:04:59,jpuu5g,What?
3859,2020-11-07 18:46:33,jpuu5g,Why are you expecting all the foreigners and teenagers on reddit to know American celebrities from the 90s and before?
3860,2020-11-07 18:23:52,jpuu5g,"Because household names are nearly as universal as people seem to think. Add to it that a lot of the names listed had their hay day back in the day it's more likely a generational difference than anything. No one recently watches Audrey Hepburn's films, the last thing Seinfeld did of relevance to modern culture is probably the Bee movie.
Admittedly neckbeards probably couldn't name recent stars or trends either but listen after they shove their head up there, there's only so much room left in their ass for anything else."
3861,2020-11-07 18:27:51,jpuu5g,???
3862,2020-11-07 18:43:01,jpuu5g,"I know almost none of those names, not because I have some elitist knowledge of other genres, or think it's beneath me to learn, but because I am simply not interested in those things. For real world people, I'm currently in the know about internet and game people like Vivienne Medrano, Sean McLoughlin and Aeji Ounuma. I like indie animation and some daily smiles, and there isn't much outside of that scope I'm particularly interested in. I have a very short attention span and those are some the people who have caught my attention long enough to remember a name without also seeing their associated media in the same place. I don't think this is a neckbeard problem, just a shifted interest problem."
3863,2020-11-07 19:55:25,jpuu5g,"Not everyone is going to have the same interests, let alone enough to recognize celebrities by name. If it's not part of your interests then why would you learn their names? Someone into NASCAR will know drivers by name and someone into Olympic diving will know divers by name, but that doesn't mean they'll know movie or mucicians by name. More than likely you'll remember the celebrities/mucicians you grew up with or the ones your parents enjoyed. Once out of their sphere of influence you'd take up your own interests.


Your post is confusing."
3864,2020-11-07 20:14:13,jpuu5g,"Because not everyone has the same interests? Some people may be invested in 3 topics max, others might have 10 different hobbies. Those that become elitists usually become arrogant after they've invested a certain amount of time in the hobbies that they participate in. Why would you care about something or even be a snob about a topic that you might not even know exists lol. 

Also what neckbeard did you run into to come to this rant? There has to be a story behind this post lmao"
3865,2020-11-07 20:44:40,jpuu5g,I’ve never heard of any of these guys. What are you taking about? What even is this post?
3866,2020-11-07 19:05:05,jpuu5g,"I guess I’m not as savy as I though, cause I’ve never heard of Shannen Doherty, timothy dalton, or Patrick mahomes. Personally I think household names are subjective, it depends on your location, age, and access to news outlets. IMO names like John Carpenter, haruo nakajima, and stuart Gordon should be household names, but that’s just because of my social sphere and how I grew up. It’s not just neckbeards who don’t know theses people, it could be anyone.

Edit: Just looked through your post history, now I understand why you think these people out household names. In a way your kinda acting like a neckbeard, getting upset with people about not knowing things your very specifically passionate about. The takeaway here is that everyone is into different things, and maybe we could all be a little patient with each other and not get mad when others don’t like our specific things."
3867,2020-11-07 20:47:14,jpuu5g,"I haven’t heard of half these names.  Of the ones I do recognize, most were famous 20+ years ago.  They’re not household names any more.

The sports names are only famous for people that follow that sport.  I don’t care about soccer; neither does most of the US.  I vaguely know Messi was a soccer player; I don’t know and don’t care what he looked like, or what team he played for.

Likewise, people who aren’t film buffs don’t care about the “behind-the-scenes” people (directors, composers, etc), so would never bother to learn their names."
3868,2020-11-07 22:35:45,jpuu5g,"You know, being familiar with ancient pop culture in 2020 is a nerd niche in itself, the reason those nerds aren't neckbeards for the most part is because neckbeards hate pop culture as a concept while still buying into those aspects that speak to them.

Being angry because people aren't interested in your niche interests, well that's quite a bit euphoric."
3869,2020-11-07 18:17:24,jpuu5g,Push comes to shove they dig deeper into their elitism and pretend that knowing who these plebian celebrities are would be beneath them.

This is probably just a social desirability thing though, as obsessive NFL fans are probably equally crazy, but since they're into football, which isn't anime, you don't notice it."

Nowadays I've just stoped caring about celebrity bs, it takes too much time and effort to bother with, but then again I  don't live in the us and was like 12~16 when i went through my major neckbeard phase so that might change things."

3881,2020-11-17 10:42:41,jput7z,"I went down a rabbit-hole of subreddits and wound up seeing this, not sure you're looking for legit responses but as someone who only knows 4 Bond actors and Audrey Hepburn from your list:  


Maybe they just don't know them. Simple as that. They have a very specific set of interests that they're concerned with and are proud of their knowledge within those interests.  


For example: I know nothing about sports. I literally could not care less about them, I can name maybe 4-5 generally well known sports persons.   


I know a lot of obscure species of birds. Because I spend my time reading about that than watching movies, sports, etc.  


When you aren't exposed to that sort of thing, you won't pick it up. They know about their niche celebrities and names because they're actually involved in their hobbies as opposed to old Audrey Hepburn films.   


(Consequentially it makes me a pretty poor candidate for quiz nights and to have me on your side of the table during trivia games is the human equivalent of inviting your pet dog.)"

3895,2020-11-08 00:38:02,jpus2x,"Because you are familiar with the people who work on the stuff you're in to. So if you like classic movies you know Audrey Hepburn, Groucho Marx, and Gene Kelley. If you're in to *The Venture Brothers* you know Doc Hammer, Jackson Public, and James Urbaniac. 

No one has to know the names of celebrities in my domain unless they want to learn about the stuff I'm in to, and I don't have to know the names of the actors from *Modern Family* or whatever everyone's watching on TV these days. 

So, getting upset about people not knowing the same celebrities you know is kind of silly. It just means that they're not into the same stuff as you, and that's allowed."
3896,2020-11-08 05:39:52,jpus2x,"Well, a good chunk of it could also be age demographic of the discord boards etc. There's a lot of baby nerds out there. Shannon Doherty, Darren Star, Jennifer Aniston, Seinfeld, etc were all at their height in mainstream culture in the mid 90's when gen z was only being born. Audrey Hepburn and Bob Seger were by the 90's looked at as Classics, which slowly faded in popularity in the early to mid 2000's.

Even in Geek culture we only idolize a certain amount of what are essentially historically popular public figures, and considering many of the ones you listed were popular in the mainstream rather than in any nerdy genres I'm not surprised they are fading into obscurity in the generations that didn't watch 90210 after school.  What has Jennifer Aniston really given geek culture unless your thing is Friends or ancient Brad Pitt drama?"
3897,2020-11-08 12:52:17,jpus2x,"Because of exposure and age. Where would ""nerds"" come across those names? Those people are famous because they are involved in mainstream TV or film, but if you don't watch that then why would you know their names? 

For me, I haven't watched mainstream TV in years. Therefore when people at work talk about what they watched last night I'm completely at sea. But I talk to them about the latest Netflix drama and they have no idea what I'm talking about. 

Also all those examples you have given are pretty old. I'm in my mid 30's and know all those names but I wouldn't necessarily expect people in their teens or early twenties to know those names."

3899,2020-11-07 19:42:02,jpsjns,The family therapy episodes made me cry. It’s pretty clear there was a lot of emotional neglect in their family history and Kris displays a lot of narcissistic tendencies. By now they are adults and have to take responsibility for their own care. But I still really felt for Rob. He’s so distressed being emotionally open with his family. They all need a fuck ton of therapy but are afraid to even crack open the chest of hidden feelings. Not to mention losing their dad.

3901,2020-11-07 20:12:34,jpsjns,"Yup, this is an accurate analysis of what's going on. They are very afraid to open up for real in the family, especially Rob. I guess this is just one of the many reasons the family has drifted apart from each other, because they are all so critical/judgemental with each other, they don't know how to create a climate of acceptance (other than Khloe I would say) so no one feels comfortable being vulnerable in the family."
3902,2020-11-07 20:49:35,jpsjns,"Yeah no climate of acceptance! That reminded me of how they focus on Rob’s weight. As if his appearance is the #1 concern and urgent to fix. No wonder he struggled to film and isolated himself. Khloe got the same appearance based focus, under the guise of “health”"

3917,2020-11-07 08:20:51,jphjoi,It reminds me on a horrible genetic skin condition...
3918,2020-11-07 07:33:41,jphjoi,That's hilarious!
3919,2020-11-07 19:47:56,jphjoi,I thought you meant the downtown library
3920,2020-11-08 05:26:21,jphjoi,They're only hated by hicks so whatever
3921,2020-11-07 05:12:11,jphjoi,Set some spotlights at the proper angle and the reflection can blind the drivers of jacked up pickup trucks.  😎😵
3922,2020-11-07 05:08:47,jphjoi,On fire...
3923,2020-11-07 03:07:54,jphjoi,They're hated because they cost $600 000...one very expensive pile of marbles.
3924,2020-11-07 08:28:06,jphjoi,I'm not much of an art person but you do realize that price is actually pretty normal for stuff like that. Way better than the bombed out building crap Calgary got lol.
3925,2020-11-07 03:13:27,jphjoi,Who paid for them? The city?
3926,2020-11-07 04:52:31,jphjoi,"I was on the same train of ""this is expensive"" but during the time I worked in Calgary, they also got some ... interesting public art:

[https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/new-500000-public-art-installed-along-the-trans-canada-highway](https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/new-500000-public-art-installed-along-the-trans-canada-highway)

Those just look like structural steel in the middle of construction."
3927,2020-11-07 03:44:12,jphjoi,"Sort of. Any new project that gets approved by the city (bridges, LRT, etc) has to set aside a certain amount (1% I think) to be dedicated to public artwork. So when they redid the bridge, the Talus dome was that ""public art"".

I personally like the Talus balls. Reminds me of a pile of snowballs. Very fitting for our winter city. Maybe eventually they'll have another pile on the opposite riverbank and then eventually 2 giants duelling it out for control of the river."
3928,2020-11-07 03:47:18,jphjoi,Ooh I like that idea.

3930,2020-11-07 00:54:59,jph05w,"I've often wondered if certain horror films can opperate as fear-based ritual magic. I've heard of demons drawing power from negitive emotions, so perhaps films created to elict fear from millions of people serve a dual purpose of feeding these entities. Say you conjured a demon (or else created a servitor) named Freddy Krueger. You fed him the fears of generations of children, to the extent that he began to haunt the very nightmare realm he has dominion over in the films. If that entity could actually ""exist"", how powerful could it have become by now? Have you ever heard of the Hat Man? Lol I don't know if this makes sense outside of my mind. Wes Craven's New Nightmare has a similar story to this and I've always wondered if it holds a few scraps of truth."
3931,2020-11-07 00:44:07,jph05w,agree
3932,2020-11-07 01:28:19,jph05w,"I agree. That's why i don't watch them. Plus fear is a low vibration, so watching movies that scare you brings down your natural vibration"
3933,2020-11-07 00:39:13,jph05w,Because they’re fun to watch
3934,2020-11-07 00:42:41,jph05w,"Dam right they are. The producers of these films are the absolute fucking scum of the earth. You bet they’re filling a sick ritual. And every time it’s played in a movie theatre you have approximately a hundred people, gathered together, relieving that horror. You bet they’re made by pedowood for a reason."
3935,2020-11-07 00:32:44,jph05w,I've always hated those kinds of movies and don't watch them. I have no idea why a person would want to watch something like that.
3936,2020-11-07 01:16:42,jph05w,Rosemaries baby..? That’s probably a bit more realistic...
3937,2020-11-07 01:22:59,jph05w,"To lower the vibration of some while also telling you what’s happening and going to happen but not just horror movies, ALL MOVIES, SHOWS, and VIDEO GAMES. Don’t think that shits all for entertainment, what people think is fake is soon to show itself. Pay attention now."
3938,2020-11-07 00:34:32,jph05w,"Yeah for some reason I grew up watching many of them (freewheeling parents) and was desensitized. It was only as I became more aware of the forces and principalities of this world that I could never watch one again. 

I think there might be something off with people who enjoy them. Nothing unfixable just a lacking of awareness maybe? Anyone want to shoot me down?"
3939,2020-11-07 00:37:38,jph05w,Lol. Wow..
3940,2020-11-07 00:52:16,jph05w,"The classic slasher flicks had moral prosciptions built into them, and generally all followed a formula. The people that die are the people that commit transgressions (they have pre-martial sex, they're rude, they're black, etc.). They started off fairly prudish in that way....""don't act immorally or you'll be killed""

Interestingly, these days horror is the only genera where Hollywood is willing to take a chance on original stories. Everything else needs a proven IP with a baked-in fan base to have a chance of getting made.

Personally, I think it has to do with looshing."
3941,2020-11-07 00:59:12,jph05w,Or people could just have a dark mind you know.
3942,2020-11-07 00:51:49,jph05w,"As a horror lover, how did you make that jump?  Arre we that desperate to make a comment?"
3943,2020-11-07 00:33:51,jph05w,Because it’s a movie. It’s not real life
3944,2020-11-07 00:48:42,jph05w,And if public executions were to become normalized people would think they’re fun to watch too. Just look at some of the more fundamentally religious counties in the ME. People will even be participatory.
3945,2020-11-07 00:58:35,jph05w,💎
3946,2020-11-07 00:36:06,jph05w,"Scientifically proven to be the best type of movie to take a date to.

Fear produces elevated levels of adrenaline, which mimic the sensation of attraction. Amusement parks with roller coasters are similarly good date spots for the same reason."
3947,2020-11-07 00:55:25,jph05w,"Then, consider me bat shit crazy"
3948,2020-11-07 02:56:35,jph05w,"""They're black"" is an example of a transgression?"
3949,2020-11-07 01:00:40,jph05w,"Well, in the USA (late 1800s in the west) they used to have public hangings and people went to watch them. Well, according to movies they did. (I wouldn't have gone to watch them though)."
3950,2020-11-07 00:56:22,jph05w,You’re comparing fiction to a real life execution.
3951,2020-11-07 00:50:57,jph05w,"Okay, I have to admit something. I told the truth that I hate horror/slasher movies and don't watch them. BUT, when I was a teenager and dating (in the 80s), I did like to go see those movies - it gave me the perfect excuse to be scared and grab onto they guy I was with, or hide my face in his shoulder/chest, etc. LOL!"
3952,2020-11-07 04:11:57,jph05w,lol glad someone caught it. Just kidding (it's a trope in horror films that the black person dies first)
3953,2020-11-07 01:00:04,jph05w,"That’s where normalizing comes in. Do you even know how to manipulate, bro?"
3954,2020-11-07 00:54:39,jph05w,There you go lol
3955,2020-11-07 01:13:48,jph05w,"Oh, so you’re saying if our culture changed we’d have different opinions on things. Wow. That’s a profound statement right there, buddy."
3956,2020-11-07 00:56:14,jph05w,"LOL! So next time you are on a date and a girl suggests a horror/slasher film, you'll know the reason!"
3957,2020-11-07 02:55:31,jph05w,I didn’t say it was. I’m amazed it took you another comment to understand.
3958,2020-11-07 03:02:14,jph05w,I’m amazed you bought it up. It has precisely nothing to do with anything. That’s like saying 1+1=2 randomly.

He was not vague at all. he was poignant, entertaining and right to the point. The only thing I would say about the anti-doping part is that he waffles back and forth about regulating it/banning it or letting it be used without regulation.

As bad as his Tyson Fury chat earlier - as if he was telling guest and viewer something new (he got really fat you know, booze and coke too)

4025,2020-11-04 03:46:53,jnn2mk,I guess it is lucky for Joe that his shows aren't solely about MMA like Luke's are. Easy to have superior knowledge in your one area of speciality.
4026,2020-11-04 15:14:00,jnn2mk,"You could kinda see how much of a child joe is on all these topics. Like luke is talking about these historical perspectives on drug doping and its effect on the sport and joe is like ""yeah its entirely possible that joe snorted some coke cut with creatine that was cut with peds"" like a man talking to a boy"
4027,2020-11-04 23:07:39,jnn2mk,Find Luke a bit too arrogant but he really was top class on Rogan. It's the first one I've listened to in a while and it was an enjoyable 3 hours. Honestly an embarrassment that he was relying on Schaub to give him a leg up.
4028,2020-11-05 03:28:13,jnn2mk,To be fair its Lukes Job to analyze fights and fighters. Its not really Joes job.
4029,2020-11-04 03:37:07,jnn2mk,Lmao true
4030,2020-11-04 06:55:03,jnn2mk,So glad I read this before listening to it. Gonna make me read too much into it and get the giggles.
4031,2020-11-04 03:26:37,jnn2mk,What always drove me crazy about this was that no one ever told him real fights take place in houses or bars or on the street where’s there walls and cars. So a cage is actually way more realistic than a fucking void to fight in.
4032,2020-11-04 02:09:46,jnn2mk,"I have a lot of respect for Luke, but I don’t feel like he really knows what the answer is. 

He knows it’s a lost battle. People will juice up. 
But I don’t think he made up his mind about weather we should green light injecting radioactive shit into your veins or just some substances, which completely defeats the purpose."

4035,2020-11-05 03:27:27,jnn2mk,"To be fair to Joe...It is Lukes job to report on these issues, not Joes."
4036,2020-11-04 04:51:49,jnn2mk,"Lol exactly, he was the Mike Goldberg of the conversation"
4037,2020-11-04 02:24:35,jnn2mk,He was the al bundy Polk high story of that conversation
4038,2020-11-04 10:50:43,jnn2mk,I was thinking of going with [Op-bro](https://youtu.be/g71fv85YzXk?t=235) but yours is even better.
4039,2020-11-04 11:23:20,jnn2mk,"When I hear “he’s a different type of human” or some nonsensical, hyperbolic shit like that, I become a depressed mook"
4040,2020-11-04 07:48:53,jnn2mk,"Not to mention, up until a few weeks ago, he hosted a radio show 4 hours a day in addition to making side content for his YT. I havent watched this episode yet, but Im sure many of the things he said are the same arguments he's been making for years - so they're fairly polished ideas"
4041,2020-11-04 04:00:21,jnn2mk,Joe has superior knowledge of nothing except drugs and jiu jitsu. Not mma. He appeals to the fair weather fans who know nothing about fighting. He comes off like he knows when he talks about how much of of a beast people like Romero is and how he incessantly talks about non related shit like their psyche.
4042,2020-11-04 09:35:59,jnn2mk,"of course. there’s a ref in there. 
by design it just can’t be a real fight"
4043,2020-11-05 03:26:39,jnn2mk,Exactly lol. What the fuck is a natural fighting environment anyway? Any environment on the planet is a natural fighting environment.
4044,2020-11-04 02:20:13,jnn2mk,His main issue that he is 100% correct on the anti-doping is usada does not have to show that their services actually help in any way. They are not held accountable for ruining people's careers\lives. They don't even have to say sorry when they screw up. They can move the goalposts of what is acceptable to ingest or inject at their leisure by giving some fugazi answer at any point to suit their interest. Their interests is keeping UFC's biggest fights intact.
4045,2020-11-04 12:12:49,jnn2mk,"I mean, what if LeBron James took up MMA from a young age? Perfect physique. Wooo, total savage"
4046,2020-11-04 10:18:04,jnn2mk,"When he says USADA doesn't do anything, he's talking about their claims of safer competition. His general argument is that since USADA came into play in the UFC, does the sport look safer? Are there less knockouts? Is there a lower risk of injury both in training and competition? These are claims they made RE anti doping measures. Do the facts bear that out? It seems not, as we still lose fights due to injury in camp (seemingly more so). We still have as many knockouts, if not more. Luke's overall argument is that USADA makes no real difference and could in fact hinder athletes from optimal recovery post fight and does nothing meaningful in terms of safety to athletes."
4047,2020-11-05 10:17:28,jnn2mk,Luke has admittedly said that he's a hypocrite on allowing and not allowing peds. His opinion is not steadfast on the regulation of it. There's still a lot of jacked human beings in the UFC. Usada has not done anything to curb that. Luke is 100% factually correct when saying USADA is not showing why their service is necessary. They have constantly changed the rules on what is acceptable levels of steroids and peds they allow. What is factually proven is that they have ruined people's lives and didn't even say as much as sorry. At this point I feel like I am just repeating everything I have already said.
4048,2020-11-05 10:08:32,jnn2mk,"He's not a reporter. Luke Thomas has not written anything in probably 2 years. He does not break news. He analyzes fights and and gives his opinion on combat news.  When toe is challenging him in such a way that he is debating him, it is impressive that a commentator knows as much as he does about specifically anti-doping off of the top of his head."
4049,2020-11-04 13:35:45,jnn2mk,Perfect description.
4050,2020-11-04 02:22:07,jnn2mk,"oh that I absolutely agree and he couldn’t be more right and on point there. 

it’s actually kinda brilliant conclusion."
4051,2020-11-04 13:29:06,jnn2mk,"That is a very accurate description of USADA’s role to the UFC. They’re not really there to protect the fighters. They let fights happen when fighters still piss hot (just call it pulsing and move on). They take no responsibility when they fuck up there own testing and railroad a fighter, potentially costing said fighter hundreds of thousands of dollars.  The fighters shouldn’t have to cover it then.  I believe Luke said approx. 20% of revenue goes back to the fighters ...but anti-doping comes out of that 20% so it’s more like 15-18% of revenue goes back to the fighters.  If USADA is only there to make the sport look more legit and help the sale a couple years back and protect the big fights, then that should be a company expense totally separate from the revenue allocated for fighter pay."
4052,2020-11-04 14:04:18,jnn2mk,"In my opinion Usada is a marketing ploy for casual audiences. That's the main reason they don't have to prove effectiveness. 

They aren't there to make the sport ""fair"". They are their to make the sport more palatable/professional for main stream viewing."

4055,2020-11-04 02:32:53,jnn2mk,"USADA have moved the goal posts on acceptable weed levels, acceptable osterine levels which kept Sean O'Malley out for 2 years and he would not have been suspended today and picogram levels. They have ruined people's lives and careers and then decided to change acceptable levels of drugs that have been detected."
4056,2020-11-04 15:11:51,jnn2mk,"100%. I don't even know how they consider usada expense part of fighter pay. That has to be for tax reasons or something. 15% revenue to the fighters is robbery. There's probably over 100 of the 600 fighters that have to work a second job to make ends meet. I know Jesse Jess only made like 15k-17k last year because she was injured. Now she's out with another ACL tear. I don't even think if the fighters were getting 50%, that career is worth it. The long-term health consequences is just not worth any money in the world."
4057,2020-11-04 15:15:18,jnn2mk,"100%. I remember it like it was yesterday. Dana White brought all the MMA media into a room, would not allow them cameras or writing material and just lambasted them over writing stories about how the UFC does not test enough. Dana told them to give him a name of who they thought was on steroids and he would get them tested right then. Of course nobody said anything but a few months later is when they teamed up with usada."
4058,2020-11-04 13:13:54,jnn2mk,He sure let that one go pretty quick once BKFC got going.

4063,2020-11-08 09:36:13,jnn2mk,Yeah definitely not what it could’ve been but I was mainly referring how Joe was basically lobbying for no gloves in the UFC for years saying ‘tHeRe’D bE LEsS DAmaGe’.  After BKFC’s first event it looked *Face Off* in that mf.  He piped the fuck down with that shit.
4064,2020-11-08 09:37:22,jnn2mk,There are more cuts in BKFC but there would be way less brain trauma and CTE.
4065,2020-11-08 09:42:09,jnn2mk,Agree....if most of their fighters weren’t already there. A lot of 40-50 year olds who already beat the shit outta each other for 20 years just trying to collect a check. Kinda sad. But definitely less volume and power able to be thrown would minimize cte.

4067,2020-11-03 22:40:04,jnkglz,Johnny and Jesse all showed disappointed over their scores early on as well so i don't get why now skai and kaitlyn can't be a bit sad and disappointed. Its near the end and they are all tired and stressed out and they are allowed to talk about their feelings. Kaitlyn seems to be so thankful and appreciative of her fans on all of her platforms as well as appreciative of constructive criticisms Derek and Bruno are giving her. Skai acted a bit immature last night but lets give her a bit grace too.
4068,2020-11-03 22:54:08,jnkglz,"I don’t think it’s fair to call kaitlyn out for this without calling everyone out. Yeah, Kaitlyn has shown disappointment and frustration at times, but looking at her social media she’s also been VERY vocal about her gratitude for just being there and getting the opportunity. To me, she’s showing a way better attitude than someone like Nev, who continues to lie and be shady about his experience. Kaitlyn talks about how hard she’s working and how thankful she is to be there, which is more than I can say for Jenna and nev. and honestly if I were Kaitlyn, I’d feel like I was being judged more harshly than some of the other contestants too. CAI is inconsistent with her scoring and it shows."
4069,2020-11-03 22:38:29,jnkglz,"Well if that tough love was given across the board then that's fine but if the judge concerned is being selective about who to give criticism to then that's bullying in itself. And there is a way to correct someone , one is to put them down and the other is to build them up . The way you "" encourage "" people will break them down or make them strive to do better. How it is done shows the persons intent."
4070,2020-11-04 02:40:34,jnkglz,"AJ's actually been highly complimentary of other contestants on his podcast and hasn't complained about his scoring at all.

His comments about judging were actually in defense of Justina, not himself. He and Cheryl were saying they thought she deserved 10s for her ""fireball"" routine last night because it was really difficult and she did it really well."
4071,2020-11-03 22:47:29,jnkglz,"The family members of the stars should just stay out of things, I could see Monica saying she would want Nev to do weel, or  Charles Oakley wanting Justina, or Carole Baskin wanting Nelly to win but that even relates back to who their pro was and who the pro is married to. Even then if they were to say something it would hopefully be postive. Skai's mom can be supportive by only worrying about her! Maybe Skai's annoyed with what her mom said and not being 9n the bottom 2? Edit put put not out"
4072,2020-11-04 00:44:36,jnkglz,"Vote for Johnny and Justina, they the only finalists that are not problematic and love to learn."
4073,2020-11-03 23:41:44,jnkglz,"I think Kaitlyn can take the criticism and she has taken some of it, but the thing that frustrates her and Artem (based on the interviews they have given) is that the judges especially Carrie Ann, pick and choose who to judge more harshly, just look at last night the judges called them out for a lift, but Crishell and Gleb did a lift too and they didnt get call out"
4074,2020-11-04 01:34:24,jnkglz,I dont understand there are  more corrections than the judges say. People don't realize that
4075,2020-11-03 22:46:06,jnkglz,The misogyny do be running deep within the DWTS fandom
4076,2020-11-03 22:48:49,jnkglz,"Because Skai especially her mom are getting ridiculous to this point. Being disappointed in one thing, it's another to react with immaturity about it. I had completely forgotten about Jesse even being on the show tbh but he to can be put in that box, stop complaining and start working harder, that's why he is out.

Johnny or any of his relatives didn't take it to the comment section to say the judges were after him btw."
4077,2020-11-03 23:04:16,jnkglz,This
4078,2020-11-03 23:16:16,jnkglz,"And I've called out Nev for the lying multiple times on this platform but here I'm talking about being able to take criticism. Nev doesn't have a poor attitude, he is just a straight up liar and manipulator."
4079,2020-11-03 22:46:31,jnkglz,"Johnny had a 22 two weeks ago, he lended in the bottom 2 I didn't see him crying about it. He is just grateful to still be here. You give tough love to someone you know can get better. I'm really tired of the BN fans coming over this show and crying when their faves get criticisms : it was the same for Joe, Hannah and now Kaitlyn. If they can't handle that maybe they should withdraw from the show.

Justina and AJ have yet to get a 10 but I don't see them complaining either, they work harder and try to get there.

Again on S25, Lindsey got for example a 28 I think for her Jazz and I didn't really saw any mistakes but I guess it was missing a little something to get her to that perfect score. And guess what, she didn't cry about it either."
4080,2020-11-04 02:42:24,jnkglz,Which is pretty much what I saw too but people were upset because I didn't mention AJ when if I remember right Cheryl was the one talking about content and all.
4081,2020-11-04 00:46:10,jnkglz,I swear I'm at this point. I would have love for Jeannie to have that thrid spot but alas.
4082,2020-11-03 23:51:46,jnkglz,"We can't compare Chrishell and Kaitlyn because Kaitlyn is a far better dancer. Artem was annoyed about the lift well what they did was a lift so there is no frustration to have about that. The lack of attack is also a fair critique. This is how it goes when you have a ringer, as a pro you are also challenged and you have to raise the bar. There is pressure that comes with having a ringer or being a ringer. 

I will also say while Chrishell was really overscored sometimes (especially last week), they called Gleb out on the lack of content for her cha cha but they didn't called out AJ the week before. And they called out AJ last night but didn't called out Chrishell."
4083,2020-11-03 22:51:16,jnkglz,"I'm the first one to call out misogyny in the fandom if you look at my posts in this sub but let's also called out poot sportsmanship. This season it those 2, on s27, it was Bobby, on S24 Bonner had the nerve to complain too, on S21 Alek had a fit ove his scores so I don't appreciate being called out for misogyny when it's not the case here."
4084,2020-11-03 22:59:17,jnkglz,"Sure her mom acted a bit ridiculous but it happens. She probably got super protective of her daughter and acted immature, its not the end of the world. It happens but we can also have a bit of grace. No one was complaining, they do press after their dances and answer those Questions. Its not like they go on IG live or do their own press just to complain."
4085,2020-11-03 23:18:51,jnkglz,He is getting high scores and everyone keeps praising how amazing he is so hasn't even gotten any criticisms. He had two slips last night and got 9s. You can't compare him to kaitlyn who has been the target the past 2 weeks.
4086,2020-11-03 22:54:34,jnkglz,"I don't understand your logic. Yea sure johnny landed in Bottom 2 but he also got 10 the week before so he at least knew he can get there again. Sometimes these people get a bit disappointed and need a bit of encouragement, it's not that hard to have a bit of empathy. No one was crying, they were defeated which means they actually CARE.

Its also not about getting 10s, kaitlyn wasn't getting 10s before the past 2 weeks and she was still happy, its more about how you deliver your feedbacks and criticisms."
4087,2020-11-04 00:12:10,jnkglz,"I mean rules are rules, right? You can't deduct a point for Kaitlyn's lift but ignore it when it comes to Chrishell. Nev had two slips last night but they still gave him 9s. The truth is that consistently matters in the competition and if a judge can't be consistent then it shows. 

CAI can ask for more from kaitlyn over Chrishell but she can't be selective when it comes to lifts since she claims its a rule rule rule."
4088,2020-11-03 23:00:37,jnkglz,"You can speak out on the misogyny within the fandom and also say or do something that some feel is misogynistic. People and their opinions are complex and things can be said or done that come across different ways. This isn’t me saying you ARE misogynistic, but more so that bringing up Skai and Kaitlyn for saying what they have but not mentioning Johnny or Jesse (or even AJ when him and Cheryl talked about simpler routines score higher with less content) leaves your argument, for this season in particular, half baked."
4089,2020-11-03 23:01:49,jnkglz,"And I would have been fine with it if it was just her mom acting like a stage mom but Skai too has shown a poor attitude on IG and this is an issue. Sh could have stopped at he post about ""btm 2 srsly"" but responding to people actually giving her good feedback like she is doing is not nice."
4090,2020-11-03 23:22:54,jnkglz,"And I'm not saying the contrary I'm just saying Kaitlyn has to do better than that. Again DWTS is mainly a competition against yourself, you have to be better than the previous week.

Nev is being unfairly held to a lower standard that he should be held to, we all know that. Now Kaitlyn needs to focus about herself and think ""maybe I should take that as a compliment, they know I can do better and I will prove them I can""."
4091,2020-11-03 23:08:38,jnkglz,Skai got a 10 before. I didn't keep a track of Kaitlyn's dances but if she has another a more fluid style again she will probably get a 10 because it is a strong point.
4092,2020-11-04 00:13:51,jnkglz,I agree for Nev. Chrishell lost points for lifts that should not have been there in the first place each time.
4093,2020-11-03 23:05:28,jnkglz,"But Jesse got the result of that poor attitude, he is out. I'm not going to harp on him it's pointless. Johnny didn't go to the extent of both Kaitlyn and Skai to express his frustration maybe someone told him to suck it up idk but he didn't. As for AJ I don't listen to him and Cheryl podcast but stated that it was rich of them to complain about content when they presented that cha cha."
4094,2020-11-03 23:47:26,jnkglz,I agree with everything you said except for Skai post .Yeah she posted  “btm 2 srsly” but after that she edit it  to say “btm 2  really guys that why it’s important to vote” I didn’t find it disrespectful  once she clarify what she meant last night
4095,2020-11-03 23:05:12,jnkglz,I completely understand but maybe she is projecting her own insecurity right now. I honestly don't think she wanted to disrespect anyone.
4096,2020-11-03 23:45:15,jnkglz,Kaitlyn hasn't done anything other than answering press questions and saying she doesn't know what else to do. She even took on her IG stories last week asking people to stop bullying CAI as its only a tv show. CAI is getting heat from viewers way more than Kaitlyn/Artem.
4097,2020-11-04 00:18:36,jnkglz,no she didn't. she had a lift last week and this week and CAI didn't even mention it.
4098,2020-11-03 23:19:15,jnkglz,"But it’s not pointless to point Jesse out if it helps your argument. The same with AJ, which you didn’t include in your argument in this post and the same with Johnny. You could’ve used all three of them also “complaining” to strengthen your point about celebs speaking out, and in the case of Jesse (who I thought was voted out because he got both low scores and didn’t have the best fanbase to begin with), costing them the MBT. Instead, you omitted them and mentioned only Skai and Kaitlyn, the two women speaking out (whether you, me, anyone in this subreddit agree or not with them speaking out) to make this point. It comes off misogynistic to do, even if you didn’t mean for it to come across that way."
4099,2020-11-04 00:50:26,jnkglz,"I think Britt has helped Johnny alot with not focusing on scores so much. That was a issue in the beginning because as Olympian skaters, they know scores matter alot so of course he was wanting the best but Britt has calmed him down and made him not worry as much about that. She helped him alot."
4100,2020-11-03 23:52:35,jnkglz,Yes and that I could have understand but then she started responding to fans on IG.
4101,2020-11-03 23:06:11,jnkglz,This is where Alan should have a talk with her to reassure her.
4102,2020-11-03 23:47:20,jnkglz,I agree that the media are getting annoying with those same questions again and again. They are trying to form some narrative here that put CAI vs Kaitlyn just like last year it was CAI vs Hannah.
4103,2020-11-04 00:25:02,jnkglz,"Yep when at the beginning. She should have scored like a 7 in the first place and 6 with that lift. But that does not mean They get to throw lift everywhere.

To the same degree Kaitlyn's Tango didn't have much Tango in it but they didn't say anything because what she got in hold was great and the breakdance at the end added value to the routine. Here the black flip didn't had anything."
4104,2020-11-03 23:25:38,jnkglz,And I didn't because initaly I did say I forgot about Jesse even being on that season you guys reminded me of him and again he is gone probably because he couldn't deal with the criticism. I can edit to add AJ if what he says on his podcast his to the same extent as Kaitlyn and Skai but I won't ass Johnny because he didn't go as far.
4105,2020-11-04 00:51:28,jnkglz,"Yes I don't know who told him to get over the scores but he did and since, he is having more fun."
4106,2020-11-04 00:11:11,jnkglz,Like for instance someone posted around the form earlier today about the lady commenting that people were saying  Skai wasn’t connecting with them or her partner. Skai responded ‘not true’  I saw nothing wrong with it. She didn’t single  out only people who was talking negative to her. She responded to a ton of comments.
4107,2020-11-03 23:52:32,jnkglz,"But CAI knows it, it's not her first rodeo. Maybe she secretly enjoys it too, who knows."
4108,2020-11-04 00:44:23,jnkglz,"Yea. I mean i don't have an issue with her deducting a point , as i said my issue is inconsistently of it. Rules should apply to all and not just some of them."
4109,2020-11-03 23:35:19,jnkglz,"I guess my last question is, when you have Skai, Kaitlyn, Jesse, AJ, Johnny (and Monica I believe also was frustrated post show with the vague critiques) saying the same things, when does it go from a “celeb’s attitude” to a shared feeling amongst the cast? Even Lindsay has been confused by the scores and critiques this season. Something has to give."
4110,2020-11-04 00:57:39,jnkglz,Britt told him. He said how much she helped him realize that its ok to not be perfect all the time because that was an issue for him. U can tell she brings out different side to him.
4111,2020-11-03 23:53:49,jnkglz,Yes and on the post about her that was shared earlier I did say maybe she should work on her delivery if she can't handle being the tough judge.
4112,2020-11-04 00:48:29,jnkglz,Yes I agree with that and I've called out CAI many times about it.
4113,2020-11-03 23:46:20,jnkglz,"If it's an overall issue about the scoring system we've complain about it and they ""attempt"" to change it. There was some seasons when they were too tough, other seasons when they were too generous. If they have an issue with CAI's delivery which I think can be an issue it's one thing that they can voice (Skai is not in that situation). Monica was protected for 2 weeks with that ridiculous scoring so she doesn't have much room to talk and Johnny didn't complain that much he was disappointed, voiced it and moved on. Jesse is gone and I have to catch up to everything AJ said before forming an opinion on him.

The scoring has been more of a mess for the past 2 seasons than it is for this one. Maybe there is also an overall frustration aver the fact that this season in under unique rules, they have less rehearsal time and they can't get as much training as they wish. Maybe that's where this coming from, they can't improve as much as past seasons because they don't have the time for it."
4114,2020-11-04 00:58:31,jnkglz,That's what a great pros does.
4115,2020-11-04 00:12:48,jnkglz,She should. She can't expect people to be kind to her when she is not kind herself when delivering feedbacks.

If you want something because you think it will make you feel ecstatic, then you have to somehow find that ecstatic place BEFORE. So you have to  use whatever [tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofattraction/comments/hefi9b/master_list_of_loa_tools_processes_protocols/) you feel inspired to, and [raise your vibrational setpoint](https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofattraction/comments/fdd054/how_to_get_in_alignment_with_your/), and raise is consistently, and unconditionally, and as soon as you tip the scale, all kinds of circumstances and events will come flooding into your experience that also make you feel similarly ecstatic. Because that's what you are tuned to. Matchy-Matchy. 

You tune to whatever radio station you want to listen to, and while all the specific songs (manifestations) are ***different***, they are all the ***same*** genre [(essence/virtually/likeness)](https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofattraction/comments/e8pt8d/if_any_loa_teacher_says_you_can_have_anything_you/) They all will make you feel whatever emotion you are broadcasting, matchy-matchy. 

Just like if you want to fly a plane (or want to learn how to do anything), you might first want to try and learn how. You wouldn't watch a 30-second TikTok video about what the airplane controls do, then try to fly across the country solo. And you wouldn't hop into a piloting subreddit and ask for any tips on how to take off, navigate and land. (You'd be **laughed** out of there *so fast* - And that's kinda what you are doing *right now*) If you want to use Law of Attraction, you should **first** learn everything you can about The Law of Attraction. (why is this concept so foreign to so many?) THEN apply what you've learned. Law of Attraction is a philosophy and unified theory on how the world works. As all unified theories are (attempting to explain *everything*) they are **not** suitable for short ""sound bites"". There are countless nuances and it needs to be studied in depth. If you want to know what to study, I've read it all, so check out [The Material](https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofattraction/comments/ed9j3l/law_of_attraction_where_to_start_a_review_of_all/) and start studying."

Lets say you want exactly 3000$ if you have ur vibration like “yeah i want 3000$ but i mean um its okay if i get 2500$?” This is lower vibration. Higher vibration is prolly like you want more and stuff (im not sure). These vibration wont match what you EXACTLY desire. What you have to do is imagine or write a scene where you own 3k and you are chilling and thinking what you would do with it and let go the worries and stuff and KNOW its done. When you KNOW and let go your vibration matches to the YOU who already HAS it in the material reality. Xx

Write everyday about the things you love and finish them to become the person you were always meant to be."
4242,2020-12-13 21:18:37,kcdg2j,"I get that this is a specific gripe, but the ""you're not special"" message is just so tiresome. We've all heard it a thousand and one times. It's one of Reddits favorite mantras for whatever reason, but that reason isn't ""because it's true"". It is *not* always relevant, especially when it comes to matters of self expression, and saying so does this whole post a disservice. Knowing this was written with that in mind makes it difficult to take the whole thing seriously.  

This advice seems intended for new or developing writers, who I imagine are exactly the sort of people who should be encouraged to explore parts of themselves however they can. Writing is the appropriate outlet for that. They're comfortable here, because they sense in themselves something worth saying. If you want to be helpful, don't be yet another voice in the crowd telling them they're just like everyone else. Invalidating their experiences by assuming they're boring, because they don't live up to some nonexistent standard, because they aren't some kind of eccentric idea of a person isn't just discouraging, it's toxic. ""Reminding"" people that they're not special sets up unnecessary gates and standards, which no amount of writing advice is going to define. By stating that their experiences aren't worth exploring in the first place, you're kneecapping new writers at the start of the race.

Feel free to disagree, but I believe individuals *are* special, and insisting otherwise isn't just lazily dismissive of their personhood but of their potential as storytellers. It's one thing to occasionally remind ourselves to keep our heads out of our asses, but when you go out of your way to be that guy with the ""harsh truth"", I have to ask: it really about helping people, or justifying something else?  Dismissing someone's individuality mistakes humbling them with tamping down their potential. The issue isn't a matter of intention either, it's simply how some people are going to interpret it. Those interpretations are going stop potential writers from writing, and that sucks.

I'm honestly so tired of seeing it, ""you're not special"" is treated like some kind of all-encompassing sage advice when all it does is smugly impart a sense of shame on people who are just trying to find their voice, express themselves, and better their writing abilities. Interesting writing isn't just reserved for real life 'characters'. Everyone has something to say, and even if it isn't terribly exciting to *you*, what matters is they're reflecting, analyzing, criticizing, creating, writing, working. Discouraging people from believing their experiences are worth exploring  helps nobody. What does help is enabling writing without these weird boundaries, encouraging people to analyze what they know of themselves and their environment, of their life. That it's okay to do that alone, and it's okay to share it and see if anyone out there understands. It's simply untrue that writing is only valid once it's seen by an audience, or once someone has met some standard that doesn't actually exist. An audience is extremely helpful, it's encouraging, but if you think it's mandatory than it's time to hit the books and read up on the countless authors who went unnoticed their whole lives. If I were a new writer browsing this sub, I'd take any advice on creative matters that includes the wholesale dismissal of your personal experiences with a massive grain of salt."
4243,2020-12-13 19:19:06,kcdg2j,"This post is a little... weird. To be a writer, what you have to do is write often. It doesn't matter if it's mediocre or excellent, it doesn't matter if it's a completely new concept or if it's an overused concept, it doesn't matter if you're following ""the rules"" or if you're not following ""the rules"". You still write often, and so, you're a writer!

You could just be a hobbyist writer. You could just be one of the best writers/authors to ever exist on Earth. It's a spectrum. Writers are people who write. There are no steps, rules, or nuances to becoming a writer other than to write. Writing is an artistic medium (and a form of communication). Since it is an art, and therefore creative, medium, you can do anything with it. There are no restrictions or limitations. Basic grammar, perhaps, but not anything, really.

This post could have been a thousand times shorter and less... strange."

4252,2020-12-13 20:30:38,kcdg2j,"Buddy, the person who doesn’t understand the basics of brevity shouldn’t be giving out writing advice."
4253,2020-12-14 10:53:16,kcdg2j,"I don't normally heckle like this, but Jesus Christ, this is a lot to unpack. This is giving me vibes akin to ""entrepreneurs"" hustling every day to get their bugatti or whatever. I can only go over so many points without writing myself into a rampage so bear that in mind. 

First of all: Mark Manson? You're using *Mark Manson* as an example to make your pretentious and arrogant writing credible? This explains more than it should lmao.  


Step 1: Give yourself burnout  
Please don't force yourself to write everyday. Writing under self afflicted pressure makes your writing worse, additionally to the basically guaranteed burnout. You can write everyday if you're motivated enough to write everyday. If you're not, let it rest. It's not a race. 

Additionally, you're literally advising us to write through stream of conciousness. Don't think, just write? A few paragraphs down you declare that it sucks. Make up your mind.

Step 2: Become a projecting egomaniac and pride yourself with willful ignorance

As someone writing his thesis about Memoirs and Biography in Media, I can with absolute certainty and 100% commitment say that you have no goddamn, not even the slightest concept of an idea of what you're talking about. Reading this is borderline insulting. What you're doing is projecting. YOU don't care about what other people lived through, YOU think memoirs suck. There is a whole goddamn industry around bringing biography and memoirs to paper, from and by people no one has ever heard of. People writing stories literally get inspired by other people's biography. For god's sake, read up on the topics you're talking about. 

Furthermore - projecting. Do you know why Tolkien was so famous? Because he spent pages filling in details. People loved that shit. YOU don't like details. Go read a comic book. Fuck off with that. 

Step 3: tie your self worth to financial success to become a shell of a human being

Not everyone writes to be famous. People don't create art to be famous, but because they have to, it's a drive from inside compelling them to express themselves. You're handling a creative process like a stock broker. C'mon. 

Step 4: repeat step 3, add misinformation and contradict yourself

A nitpick, since history was part of my degree: common capital punishment ""in the old days"" was to be literally beheaded, they made a spectacle out of it. The executioner had to learn for years how to properly sever the head of the victim in one clean sweep. People lined up to get sprayed by blood for fuck's sake. The Executioner was cast out of the city if they didn't do their job right, but ""capital punishment"" was NOT exile.

Anyway. Your part about humans being social creatures and caring about what other people think clashes with your ""the inner workings of other people's minds are not interesting"" in a kind of hilarious way. You could argue that that's two different beats but reading the rest of your barf makes me wonder. Think before you speak.

Step 5: repeat step 3 and end with a sardonic smile

Being a writer is not about having something. The state of being x being bound to quasi-materialistic object y is mind-bogglingly naive. This is reading like you're being brainwashed by space maggots or something. 

Describing something is retrospective in nature. Much like you can't say you're \[insert political stance here\] and *then* behave like one you can't say you're a writer and t*hen* write.

Also, in regards to the OP, I’m not sure if the whole “write everyday” thing is the *best* advice. I don’t know if they said it anywhere in there (I couldn’t be assed to read all of it), but did they mention about getting feedback? What I mean is - asking others to review your works? I think it’s very important to developing one’s skill - more so than writing everyday. To draw comparison, writing every day without getting feedback is almost like doing math problems that don’t come with answers. Sure, you can do as many math problems as you want, but how do you know you’re doing them right if you don’t have answers to refer to? Whereas, if you get others to review your works, that’s almost like a “marker”, and you finally get your answers in order to “improve”. I don’t know, this is all just from my experience, haha."

For some writers, (like me), writing is an art. ""Writing just to write"" is like throwing paint on canvas just to waste paint and canvas. 

I write when I have a thought worth writing about. Because I know I write well. Writing also takes an emotional toll on me, so I spend those emotional spoons carefully on things that are worth it.

But I suppose people that know they write well don't need to read things like this. :D"
4278,2020-12-14 06:12:13,kcdg2j,This is literally what Steven Pressfield talks about but much more condescending
4279,2020-12-14 05:05:51,kcdg2j,"Pressfield's book The War of Art is the most toxic piece of writing advice I've ever come across, and is only seconded by Stephen King's.

There is no such thing as Resistance (or Satan) that is trying constantly to get you to not write or produce whatever your art is.

I'm not saying I disagree with all the specific advice, but the overall frame is so toxic and false, I don't think the good advice shines through enough. What I mean is, if you take his book to heart, you are setting yourself up to have a neurotic, toxic relationship to writing. I'm not saying you can't push through it and become successful  using its methods, as someone can be chased by a murderer and become more fit because of it (but eventually the thing you're running away from will be there to greet you, because you've creates this psychotic expectation that something is after you, trying to thwart your path, which simply isn't how writing works, unless you convince yourself that it is).

If you read Pressfield, please at least don't adopt his mindset. Use whatever techniques seem good to you. Writing definitely improves one's writing, and creates output, but the goal to write every day puts you on a surefire course to beating yourself up when you don't do it, and reaching a baseline when you do reach it, walking on the knife's edge of the all or nothing mentality of ""if you are a real writer you write everyday or else you are not a real writer.""

Sometimes what's good for real writers is to take some time to plot your book, to explore possibility without the arbitrary goal of writing every day. You will enjoy writing more by creating a healthier relationship to writing. If you write novels, read Save the Cat Writes a Novel. It teaches you how to outline a story. By creating a powerful story and understanding plot points that are coming up, you will receive automatic energy to write your story. No fear here. You will see where you want to go and be able to get there incrementally. And you'll really enjoy it, while Pressfield products will be riding the knife's edge of highs when you've kept your writing streak up and lows when you've fallen short of your misfounded goal. 

TLDR: If you are a writer: Do NOT write every day."

These are the words that Brandon Sanderson took away from his repeated failures of becoming published. He wanted to become a famous and successful author, so he moved towards that end. One day, after repeatedly failing to get published he decided to make a novel that would be published. Upon finishing it, he realized how much he hated it. He considers that story, the worst story he ever wrote and scrapped it without trying to get it published. 

He then went out and wrote his perfect novel. That novel was too long to ever be published and so, no one published it. He then made a decision to break the novel up and rewrite it has a 10 book series he is now writing called The Storm Light Archive."

I always feel impatient while reading something, but this time something miraculous happened. Anyways, the moral of the story is to know your favourite domain and write about that every day. Literally, every day. 

That's the problem with me. I actually want to become a writer but I'm thinking I don't have enough experience in a particular topic to write about every single day. And with the difficulty level, I found research difficult and after research on a topic, I don't think that voice will come naturally from me. 

What should I do? Should I write about something I don't know? And by writing every day, how can my writing improve if I won't edit or proofread or observe what are my problems? I mostly have grammatical problems and vocabulary. Sometimes, I use some words and phrases in the wrong place. 

Well, I'm thinking of writing on a domain I don't even have an idea about. what should I do? Should I start reading about the topic and learn that topic entirely and then start writing on that topic regularly, or I should write something anonymous every day? I actually get stuck at choosing the topic for writing and procrastinate another day. Kindly suggest!"

I think writing is about discovering who you are. Once you find what you love to write about you can do it so much more often and so much better. It will remind you in the times when you don't feel like it that you're meant to write what you love and there is no reason not to do what you love.

I want to become the best writer i can possibly be and enjoy doing it. I don't just want to write sometimes or only when i feel like it. I want to learn to eat breathe and sleep writing. Because that will make it a passion that ill always have, and by putting that much time and love into it I'm sure to get decent. I won't get burnt out writing if every session is geared around why i love writing.

Becoming a great writer is a lot like writing in and of itself. If i start with a character in position A, and then i imagine some insane ending that seems super cool to me, i just need to figure out the most interesting way to get from A to the end. If my goal is to be someone who loves writing and writes 2000+ words nearly every day, then i have to problem solve until i am that person. Or maybe along the way I'll discover a better way.

4306,2020-12-14 07:07:25,kcdg2j,"I’ve been feeling really bad about my own work lately. I write a lot of stories, for years since I was 13, now 20. It feels like My scripts aren’t interesting and sometimes I believe that my ideas aren’t good enough. I’m only starting to learn I have to add in my own flare if I want those ideas to become more than just ideas, and then more than just what’s been told already. Most of my work is a mixture of what I love or a mixture of shows I’ve seen; I write my own comics and partnered to try to publish for darkhorse next year after 2 years of working on a epically scaled story, it was a idea and it started to really pick up once I started to fall in love with our characters and world, however it still never feels finished like it’s just getting started or we can do more. 

I’m currently working on the outline over and over before we send it out in the mail while working on my other passion project stories on the side. I can tell you going to college online has been a nightmare, but it’s driven me since 2 days ago to really think about what kinda stories I want to tell. I look for every single piece of detail from a characters location, their ecosystem, their clothing, their culture etc. everything that makes the story flourish because of this graphic novel I’m trying to publish. 

I still have a long way to go, and I don’t consider myself a writer yet. I honestly didn’t consider myself a artist for a long time, but sometimes you just gotta appreciate the moment. 

This post was exactly what I was looking for and I feel bad I couldn’t manage my time enough for so many months to write more and more on what I wanted to do. I bet Pressfield felt the same way and I hope to be able to get my own work published, and have a whole book shelf of graphic novels I can call my accomplishments. 

I consider Graphic Novels just as hard to make as novels if not more in some cases. Love what I do, even if it’s more of a hobby right now more than anything. Hopefully, it’ll be a great secondary career one day."

I did have this dawning moment in my life one time where I realized that the only thing that separated me from, say, a famous chef, is just what they do.  Like, if I made food that way, that's all there is to it.  I don't have to actually be some different person in order to be able to do it.   I'm not prevented from attaining something because I'm ""just me"".  The only thing standing between me and doing something is doing it.  Maybe it's something I can do, maybe I can't, but people who are achieve amazing things aren't doing it because they're a different class of human being from which I'm excluded.  Finally realizing this as an adult gave me so much more confidence and has made me more relaxed."

Personally, I loved it. It resonated with me and made me want to write. Others hated it, and expressed why. Maybe it's because of their own feelings about writing, or where they are in their journey as a writer. I'm sure this spoke to those who haven't yet made the leap to ""write"" and call themselves a ""writer"" and isn't that the point? Regardless, it got everyone talking.

Here's my solution; You're only a writer when you're writing.

Not when your friends ask. Not when your coworkers ask.

You can tell them that you write, but probably shouldn't present it as a state of being unless it's true.

For instance, you haven't breathed; You're a breather. You constantly are breathing.

Unless you write the same (and some people do), you've written and sometimes/often/seldom write --but you're not a writer.

If you wrote this morning, you were a writer this morning. Feel phenomenal about that.

If you're writing now, you're a writer now (I'm a writer right now).

If you keep saying you'll sit down to write but never do, then you'll be a writer when you sit down to write: Never."

So does this mean you’re not allowed to take weekends off like professionals in every other field? Why not?

Lawyers, doctors, rocket scientists: none of them share this bizarre obsession with working *every day*. To them, an ordinary work week is plenty to achieve professional success.

Realistically, not taking days off is a recipe for burn out. Not something to strive for.

Writing *consistently* (but with regular days off) is probably important — at least it has been for me.

But then again, I know some writers who don’t write consistently, they’re much more sporadic. And yet they’re still writers because they manage to finish works of writing, and that’s all that matters."

Simple words might excite some people because at that single moment they empathized with the feeling that those simple words meant at the time... for them. But that won’t last long. There is a reason that Homer’s Odyssey withstood time and Goethe’s writing is recognized to this day: they were strict with their structure, they had a purpose, they achieved perfection, their meaning was timeless. I think that is the meaning behind the long post and, for those who care, for those who invest time in becoming better and paying close attention to detail, this long post will mean so much more to them than a short, possibly weak structured post that can be read in seconds and then forgotten while reading the immediately next post. Also, this post is strange for those who have not read similar narration. 

Writing can be a flash of information and an arrow shot straight to the mind. But there is so much more to it; it can be life, it can be expression just for the sake and love of expression itself. Just because we live in the world we live in, does not mean that we must forget the beauty in analyzing simple, real, and meaningful moments.

The OP seems to be suggesting that Scott pushed his men too hard to cover ground too quickly—and that’s why they starved to death?

So what did Scott’s mentioned ‘other’ interest in scientific exploration have to do with it?

Also, how would being forced to cover more distance lead to starvation? I could certainly see exhaustion, sickness, fatigue, demoralization, etc, but surely they wouldn’t *starve* simply from being pushed to cover too much distance per day.

Also, couldn’t the metaphor prove the importance of NOT working *every* day as a writer, because you don’t want to burn yourself out and ‘starve’ like Scott’s men?"

4444,2020-12-14 08:23:04,kcdg2j,"It is toxic in that King pretty well says if you aren't writing 2,000 words a day then you aren't a real writer, which if you read my comment would make sense as to why that's toxic. When someone with the platform that King has says something like that in his autobiography on writing, it has an immense negative effect on the writing community. I mean the health of someone's relationship to writing, as Pressfield does as well.

 I'm not saying you won't end up with product if you hammer away 2,000 words every day. But you're going to be on that knife's edge up and down cycle it creates. 

Stephen King became prolific through use of cocaine. He used cocaine to write and write and write, then he has the audacity to tell people they aren't real writers unless they write 2,000 words every day. How did King do it? Cocaine. His advice is actually wreckless, especially for aspiring writers. It's so easy to ease into writing and increase the amount you write at a natural pace without self judgment and that arbitrary obligation to do it every day. That's at the heart of the post and my criticism of King and Pressfield. I'm not saying the boring stuff that has nothing to do with writing advice in King's book on writing is toxic or bad or poorly written or anything. But one of the main pieces of advice he gives in it is toxic. And that really does sort of sour the whole thing. 

But like I said above, I'm not saying that specific techniques that are mentioned are bad, if you find them useful. But show me an aspiring writer who takes to heart the idea that they must write 2,000 words every day or else they're not a real writer, and in a few years it's possible I would then show you a person who has a published book, but not necessarily--but what I would be able to show you is a person who has sacrificed their wellbeing and their relationship to something they could have otherwise been healthy with and loved every step of the way instead of making it an ultimatum. Think about it. It's a bad goal. Aspiring writers haven't even plotted their stories enough to keep a 2,000 word per day pace. So they will fail, or what they will write will veer off into no man's land. Or worse, they will succeed, and every single day they will write, knowing that as soon as they fail there's self abuse waiting for them.

It's the self abuse I'm advocating against. I'm not saying these two mentioned authors directly tell you to beat yourself up (as Pressfield creates a satan figure he calls ""resistance"" to do the beating up for you), but what I am saying is that adopting their goals and mentalities surrounding writing is astronomically more likely to harvest a toxic relationship with writing. Aspiring writers who haven't read those things can consider themselves lucky. 

Also, many aspiring writers don't understand story structure. And most writers end up doing much better after plotting. King discourages plotting. Yep. He does. It really is to the point with him that I wonder if he's intentionally trolling aspiring writers or intentionally trying to divert them. It's hard to tell. But the next time someone becomes successful by using cocaine, and they try to give you advice on how to become successful in that thing, and that advice doesn't include an encouragement to do cocaine, take a step back and question if that advice is very good or if it is very bad. When it comes to Stephen King, I would say it's very bad. 

That said, writers do write. It's an amazing part of the process of creating a story. And if someone wants to be a writer, plotting, outlining, and day dreaming are excellent activities. If you aren't writing, it's much more likely due to some arbitrary expectation you've placed on yourself (from King or Pressfield). If your own story isn't interesting enough to provide natural motivation to put words on the page, it's not because you don't beat yourself up enough (which is essentially what Pressfield is about), it's because you haven't designed a story that pulls you to write it, likely because you've wasted your time not plotting by trying to reach a 2,000 word or some odd daily writing goal. It can be very very good to rest from writing. Pressfield and King come from a different mentality, one that says it makes more sense to feel bad, even when you take one single day off. The thing is, writers benefit from time away from the craft. And they certainly benefit from allowing creativity to flourish for days, weeks, and months without a daily writing goal, or any writing goal for that matter. 

That's why I think that.

Even if King's advice doesn't span many of his pages, the effect of his words on aspiring writers perhaps makes his mentality worse than Pressfield's, as not as many people read Pressfield's the War of Art. But if you ever want a trip down the ""how to create an adversary in your head who constantly tries to trip you up"" rabbit hole, read the War of Art. It'll make you better at beating yourself up than anything else (if you feel drawn to any craft that can remotely be tied to the arts, writing heavily included).

What I will say is that this kind of nose to the grindstone and devil at your heels approach does seem to work for some kinds of goals, like exercise. But as I said above, if a murderer chases you, you will become more fit from the running. You receive the cardiovascular benefit. Doesnt mean you'll enjoy any of it. 

People can beat themselves up to reach goals. It just isn't a good formula for aspiring writers."

Another thing to add onto that is that what I said above doesn't have to have anything to do with feeling like writing. Because I can wake up and not feel like doing shit. I can be tired as hell, maybe I just went through a hard time and am on the verge of depression. I am not trying to erase the pains of life from existence.

But if you spend ten thousand hours writing, but don’t do any reading, well you’ll probably have written a bunch of stuff. So you will be, by definition, a writer.

But reading is still really important to learning how to write well.

Truth be told, if your goal is to make a living off your writing, you need to prioritize putting in the writing hours first. And treat reading as extra credit. (Unless it’s something really pressing — like a key comp in your genre.)

The same goes for just about anything else. You like art? Music? Acting? Of course you do! It's great fun when you're doing it for its own sake.

it's true, he quotes the 2k a lot. he says you have little chance of getting published. he's talking about the profession ""writer"". and he's right btw. if you can't produce it's gonna be rough. i read his point less as being a rule of apotheosis. more a concession to reality.

but the 2000 word quote specifically in ""On Writing"" is a lot more tame actually:

> I  like  to  get  ten  pages  a  day,  which  amounts  to  2,000 words.  That’s  180,000  words  over  a  three-month  span,  a goodish length for a book—something in which the reader can get happily lost, if the tale is done well and stays fresh. On some days those ten pages come easily; I’m up and out and doing errands by eleven-thirty in the morning, perky as a rat in liverwurst. More frequently, as I grow older, I find myself eating lunch at my desk and finishing the day’s work around  one-thirty  in  the  afternoon.  Sometimes,  when  the words come hard, I’m still fiddling around at teatime. Either way is fine with me, but only under dire circumstances do I allow myself to shut down before I get my 2,000 words. 

Does this read like must-do advice to you? it doesn't to me. just some guy talking about his process.

>cocaine

yeah, cocaine is not the way to go. that's a personal failing. he acknowledges it, though. and btw, cocaine came much later. he was writing loads before and after. so your point is a bit reductive.

> King discourages plotting. Yep. He does.  

he does. and i disagree with him. although i had the same impression as you had. i don't think that's good advice. doesn't rise to the level of toxicity in my book, though.

> If you aren't writing, it's much more likely due to some arbitrary  expectation you've placed on yourself (from King or Pressfield). If your  own story isn't interesting enough to provide natural motivation to put  words on the page

this is just patently false. at least in the generalized form you put forth. this might be your problem, i won't judge. but it's not true for me or for many others. i'm supremely lazy. i need my instant gratification. writing is... not that. my story is great. and i'm having fun telling it. still need the sheer force of will to sit down every day.

so yeah, for me it's a bit like excercise. you do it for the long term benefits. 

> Pressfield and King come from a different mentality, one that says it makes more sense to feel bad 

i can't speak to pressfield but On Writing does simply not put forth this mindset. 

from the ending:

> Writing isn’t about making money, getting famous, getting dates, getting laid, or making friends. In the end, it’s about enriching  the  lives  of  those  who  will  read  your  work,  and enriching your own life, as well. It’s about getting up, getting well, and getting over. Getting happy, okay? Getting happy.

4500,2020-12-14 16:07:23,kcdg2j,"Stephen King says, ""I suggest a thousand words a day, and because I'm feeling magnanimous, I'll also suggest that you can take one day a week off, at least to begin with. No more; you'll lose the urgency and immediacy of your story if you do. With that goal set, resolve to yourself that the door stays closed until the goal is met.""

He suggests 1,000 words a day for beginners with one day off that he shames you for before he even says it's acceptable to have. He says if you are a good writer and want to become a great one, fuhgeddaboudit. He may try to make it sound funny, but what he is saying is that a good writer CANNOT become a great writer. You can clearly see this is false. As great writers were once good writers, not always great writers. They became great by creating stories. Some of them did so toxically like Stephen King, and some did it healthily. 

You said: ""it's true, he quotes the 2k a lot. he says you have little chance of getting published. he's talking about the profession ""writer"". and he's right btw. if you can't produce it's gonna be rough. i read his point less as being a rule of apotheosis. more a concession to reality.""

It sounds like you're trying to equate ""having little chance of getting published"" with those who ""can't produce,"" as if 1k or 2k words a day is the only way someone can produce, which is so utterly false. You can produce without such an arbitrary and constructing, and toxic, goal. And if you read his point as not being a closer to a rule, did you even read the book? He uses the word ""suggestion,"" but all the context and belittling he does surrounding the suggestion and the idea that at minimum what you're going to accomplish is to not be a bad writer because being good is likely out of your reach, then it is very clear that his message is ""if you aren't writing a thousand words a day (2k implied, with no days off eventually), then you have no chance of getting published, are doing this thing wrong, and are not a real writer. (If you want more quotes that solidify his message about this I'd be happy to quote his words about to more. It's as if you didn't read the book through the lens of an aspiring writer.

I'm not saying the book doesn't have any good writing advice, but that the toxicity eclipses its effect on aspiring writers. I'm not saying you can't read his autobiography as an interesting look into drug addiction and someone's life. But it creates neurotic writers, if they believe what he says, which aspiring writers can tend to do.

The 2,000 word exact mark is more tame, yes. But when taken in context, the message is, ""start with 1,000 and a day off because you probably can't hack it, but eventually take no days off and write more than 1,000 words a day, as 1,000 is my suggestion for starting point, 2,000 is the real deal."" That's the meaning that comes across in context. And yes, to aspiring writers, his wird count suggestions do sound like must-do advice. He says, ""If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot."" Must. He says must. And then says 1,000 words a day is the starting amount. People who read his book aren't stupid. They get his message. King seems to understand how to use words to convey meaning. The meaning he conveys is exactly: ""If you aren't writing over 1,000 words a day with no days off except maybe holidays, then you are not a real writer.""

Cocaine did not come much later. King used cocaine to write some of his successful books. Had he reached success before then? Yes. Did he use cocaine to do so? No. He used alcohol. He was an alcoholic before he wrote the Shining. That's way back. I'm not concerned about the personal failing part of it. I'm glad he doesn't feel addicted anymore. But he became successful through drug use. Yes, he does say you don't have to use drugs to be successful, but if he became successful via alcohol addiction, maybe some of his other writing advice stems from similar mentalities that come from addiction, which they do. And I'm not saying you can't use that addiction approach to writing. Feel free.

I'll requote this part you think is patently false that I said:  ""If you aren't writing, it's much more likely due to some arbitrary expectation you've placed on yourself (from King or Pressfield). If your own story isn't interesting enough to provide natural motivation to put words on the page""
I stand by this. If your story doesn't motivate you, it's more likely you have arbitrary expectations you've placed on yourself, such as daily writing and word count goals. Are you only trying to refute that with your own anecdote? So you haven't had daily writing goals then? 

No, having a toxic relationship to writing isn't a problem I have anymore. My stories motivate me to write. What I'm saying is that it's amazing. That thing I said above is true for many others. It may not be true for you and for some. But most ""failing"" writers actually do have unattainable writing goals that have diminished their writing progress. I do venture that you at some time had such a goal as well. But hey, maybe not. I'm sorry about the supreme laziness you feel you have. That is a perception about yourself that you interpret more than it is an objective fact about you. Believing that you are lazy can cause you to fulfill that storyline in your mind. It's a perception that you can prove right or just let go of. I'm not saying you have to let it go, but not letting it go doesn't mean that most people who fail at writing didn't have arbitrary goals. Many do. Go ask them. Seriously. You may think my point is patently false, but that's just simply not the case. It can be true for some that the greater their story is the less likely they are to write it, but that's likely from some other reason going on with them. The better your story is, and the fewer arbitrary expectations and self judgment you place on it, the easier it will be to write. Make your story better, and it will write itself, unless you are thoroughly convinced of your laziness.

And I'm sorry if you have any condition that causes the laziness. I'm not trying to be down on things like that, like ADHD or something. I'm just saying if brain chemistry is more average then what I said is totally true for most people. Not all, but most.

Writers can write successful books without forcing themselves to write and beating themselves up when they don't. It's just a fact.

And to be honest your reply sounds like you did not read the book as an aspiring writer, or didn't pick up on the actual context of his advice.

I'm not saying there aren't some good things in his book. He's good at craft. Craft is not all there is to storytelling and novel creation. But it's a part. 

If you're referring to parts of his book that don't have anything to do with writing advice, then yes I'd have to brush up on those to be able to speak about them, but I feel like this is mostly about his advice and the context from which it came, which you seem to have not picked up when reading. I'm not sure why you failed to do so, but if you're going to  claim I don't understand his book, please reread it so you have some semblance of ability to be honest about his advice on writing, as with the amount you seem to be claiming to know the book, your words are now precisely misrepresentative. Please correct your understanding of that book if you're going to support it. It's toxic. But some people like that sort of thing. It's just that most can do better without it.

If you want other quotes from the book I could supply those. There are also good parts of the book I could supply. But the bad ones are there. Actually, come to think of it, I don't recommend rereading it. It really isn't worth it. But you may like Pressfield if you feel writing is something that the devil is trying to stop you from doing. 

And sorry about the blue quote bar if it's here. Didn't figure out how to get rid of it. Also, I wish you and all others luck and success with their writing! You can do it! I haven't found the least toxic way of combating toxic mindsets yet, but maybe one day I'll get closer. Not this day haha. Seriously though, there are healthier ways to approach writing."
4501,2020-12-14 17:21:40,kcdg2j,"Yeah it was a bit unrealistic in addressing the hard side of writing, I agree with that. I honestly don't actually think there is anything wrong with chasing after an unrealistic goal though, as long as I don't give up when I encounter those hard times. If I expect them and still push forward then nothing really can stop me. I think it'd be worth chasing after the flowery side your whole life. The more you can tip the scales of writing to that side of things, the less the burden of the hard times will weigh, the less it will feel like work.

there's plenty i disagree with when it comes to stephen king. first of all his novels. i don't particularly like them. but to say he's toxic? that's a little dim.

as someone who actually does this as his job atm, i gotta tell you: if you write less than say 1000 a day the chances of you becoming published, let alone make a living writing, are miniscule to none.

this is simply a fact. can you get lucky? sure. wouldn't bet on it, though.

I'm not condoning it. it's simply the way it is. there are many good writers out there, many of whom are just better at production than you or me. it's a tough, tough marketplace. and aspiring writers need to hear that.

if these are your aspirations, i honestly hope you'll be in the position to see that i'm right, some day. be careful what you wish for, though.

as with any self-employed profession, you gotta put in the time and the effort.

if you just treat it as a hobby and want to tell some good stories, that's fine, too. not saying you can't write good books. maybe you can. maybe you're even gonna get a book deal. but the long-term publishing game is a little more than that.

> Writers can write successful books without forcing themselves to write  and beating themselves up when they don't. It's just a fact. 

sure, they can write books without forcing themselves to write. successful ones? no. there's deadlines, contracts and your agent and editor basically sit on your lap. there's gonna be days you just hate sitting on your computer, but still gotta.

it's not about beating yourself up about not writing. it's simply about developing a decent work ethic. and that's not toxic. that's just reality. you won't make it in this game if you're not able to treat it as a job.

a great and terrifying and ridiculous and fulfilling job.

still a job."

I'm maybe weird though because I really like streamlining when I edit, it's just very satisfying somehow. I sometimes print scenes out and attack them with a red pen because it just engages a different part of my brain than editing on screen. It switches me from writer mode to editor mode and I can be more dispassionate."

4534,2020-12-14 00:36:00,kcdg2j,I should have generalized less. Mea culpa.
4535,2020-12-14 18:23:02,kcdg2j,"Yeah I feel like you're not grasping the difference between interpretive frame and writing goals that people place for themselves that are not good to have when starting out writing. I too have written at that word count you've described. It's not bad to write at that word count. And if you become successful, you will likely enjoy writing around that or above. That is entirely different from the message King gives in his book on writing. I'm not trying to misinterpret whatever I don't agree with as toxic. I'm specifically saying to tell an aspiring writer the things that King does in the context he does so has the effect of saying you need to write a thousand words a day and can have a day off for now, but not for long. It sounds like you think I'm saying that successful authors don't get up to that kind of word count product. That's not what I'm saying. They do. It's toxic for writers who are starting out. Not the device to write, the frame surrounding it.

Brevity may be the soul of wit, some say, but thoroughness is the soul of lucidity, and we are talking about things in a lucid way, not trying to be witty, unless that's something I've missed that you've been trying to do.

If you wrote 500 words every other day your chance of being published versus writing 1000 words every day does not go from minuscule (to none) to having a chance. You have a chance of being published if you write 500 words every other day. Please don't make up something otherwise. And yes, once a writer is published they may increase their writing. But again, I think you've missed the point about aspiring.

I'm glad you write a bunch, and hope you're successful, and hope you're not neurotic about it or beat yourself constantly for it. It just isn't true to tell people to try to do a thousand words a day with one day off a week and that is the way you know if you're doing it right. Many aspiring writers who read King's book on writing come away with that exact goal and that exact message and that exact misinformation. It just isn't true. 

Yes, you put time and effort into it. It's as if you don't think that I think time and effort are necessary. You're completely missing the point. Making good art is definitely work, a lot of work. What I'm saying is that the Pressfield's and the King's of the world are giving a bad frame around writing for aspiring writers. ""Write"" is great advice. The way King says it with the context in which he says it has toxic effect for many people. Aspiring writers could use some more plotting, which King tells them not to do. Add it together and the effect is neurotic writers. Pressfield is even worse. If you read that you would likely better understand what I'm trying to say.

This is not a strawman argument:
""But you may like Pressfield if you feel writing is something that the devil is trying to stop you from doing.""
It's conditional. If you feel writing is something that the devil is trying to stop you from doing, you may like Pressfield. 1. It cannot be a strawman because I'm not saying it is you. I'm saying if it is you, if you fit the description, then you may like Pressfield. If you don't fit the description, the statement doesn't apply to you. 2. It is actually a true statement. If you believe the devil is trying to stop you from writing, that's what the War of Art is about. Seriously. So it's true you may like it if that's the way you view the world. 3. The word ""may"" is much too unspecific for logic to say the statement is wrong, as it is true that you may, whether you fit the description or not, but the statement is tied to the description. I'm fine if it turns out you're wanting to condescend, but if that's what you're doing, please at least have a basic understanding of the fallacies you decide to mention, as you clearly do not. I feel bad that this sounds mean, but I love the truth too much to pass it up. Maybe you understand other fallacies. But you don't understand the strawman fallacy (according to your use of the term).

If you have deadlines and contacts and agents, you are already a successful author. I'm not talking about already successful authors. A successful author would probably not be as negatively impacted by King's book on writing. I'm talking about aspiring writers who don't have deadlines and contracts and agents. But even then, it's not necessary to force yourself to do it. ""Force"" is an interpretation and a frame, not a reality. You can set aside time to write. That's not force. Admittedly, many people may not be able to reach deadlines without forcing themselves. This is what I'm talking about. King's book contributes to their perception of forcing themselves. Locking yourself in your room. Etc. 

You can develop a good work ethic without beating yourself up. I think that's something we can agree on. Some people are able to take a writing goal of 1,000 words every day with one day off a week (and later no days off a week while writing 2,000 words a day) and not be toxic with it. I'm not saying that isn't possible. But when advice like that is taken by writers who are starting out and just developing their approach and relationship to writing, and if they have added that with the frame and context King gave them, for most it's a recipe for disaster. 

If you've seen the movie Whiplash, writing is not like how drumming is in whiplash. Writing isn't about sacrificing everything to become good. It's not about sweating and bleeding. It's about creating a great story, an enjoyable story. That involves periods of day dreaming. Especially for aspiring writers who don't have deadlines. And I think plotting the novel is key to this, as it's astronomically harder to get ""writer's block"" when you have an understanding of what's coming. I'm not saying do nothing and a book will appear. I'm saying the order of operations King gives harms aspiring writers. That's why I call it toxic. I'm not a fanatic about ""toxic"" things. But this one happens to fit the description. 

I'm glad to hear about your writing successes. And I bet you could write a better book about writing than Stephen King did."

I'm not asking you to delete or reword your comment or explain anything to me. I'm just pointing out that the person who created the post was writing with a specific tone of voice, for a specific purpose, and perhaps you and the others people in this thread should factor that into your criticism before you tear it down for being ""grandiose"" or draw comparisons to your narcissistic ex-boyfriend or whatever – because, despite your disclaimer, it's still a bit of a weird thing to say. If I'd put the effort into making this post and then read someone make a comment like that underneath, I'd feel a little offended. Even if you have been gracious enough to say they're not actually a narc.

4636,2020-12-12 17:26:19,kbqsqo,49 here and right there with you.   But then I wouldn't have these two children...
4637,2020-12-22 06:57:18,kbqsqo,"I am AMAB, I turned 12 in 1990, and I remember experiencing panic and regret around that time when I discovered that my mom’s shoes no longer fit me. 

It was so obvious then, wasn’t it? I didn’t really enjoy the “boy” stuff, my friends were all girls, I detested hair and beard and voice and height eventually brought on by puberty. I learned the word “transsexual” from the World Book Encyclopedia, and I was amazed that there was a word for this situation—that there were people out there who had transitioned—but I knew it was something I could not talk to my parents about. It was too much, too weird, so I also decided to hide it. 

Like you and u/fastpilot71, I love my children, and I can’t reimagine my life without them. But nothing else seems to fit in my life now, and I’ve never really had a period of time where I felt like anything did. My marriage is ending, my career is going nowhere, my parents from whom I hid this secret from will be dead sooner rather than later, so I’m wondering what over-all benefit was there to deciding to stay male three decades ago? or really, in remaking that decision the same way every time I’ve started to get all gender-panicked in years since?

My bright highlight in private life in the last two years or so was a freaking makeover I had with a gender-nonconforming makeup artist and photographer two weeks ago. I was there to see what I might look like in the best case of transition. She is very skilled, and I was shocked at what she could do. It was a lot of makeup, padding, lighting, and the best selected from a hundred or so pictures, but seeing myself in that light made me really happy."

I only became unstuck when my falsely ""supportive"" wife came out as a lesbian and ditched our marriage--she pretends because she didn't cheat beforehand, that she was ""faithful"".  I hope you can become unstuck soon at afar lower cost than realizing someone you love does not and never did really return that love."
4640,2020-12-12 19:24:39,kbmt1x,"So you say  ""**Sick of people treating you like shit? It's probably your fault**"" in your post. Ok, so that's one position to take, not saying that it's necessarily right.

But earlier you stated to a woman on r/datingadvice:

>It's easy for somebody like yourself to come away from a date thinking 'not even this guy with the poor dress sense and terrible social skills finds me desirable enough to go on a proper date with me.' This isn't true at all. You just so happened to experience a date with a man who only had one thing on his mind at the time.  
>  
>Realise that his horniness and lack of manners has no bearing on your value. He would likely act like this on a date with any woman he felt physically attracted to. It wasn't a personal attack on you or even a true reflection of his overall attitude towards you.

In the above paragraphs you state that it's NOT the woman's fault for being treated like shit and instead pin the blame entirely on the man who went on a date with her. **Sick of people treating you like shit? It's probably the perpetrator's fault.** This is in direct contradiction to the central thesis of your post. 😂😂😂

Based on the logic of your post, the woman treated like shit on her date...it's probably her fault. She subconsciously gave off vibes that allowed her to be treated like shit, supposedly. The fact that the man she went on a date with treated her like shit means that she permitted it through her behaviour and thus she should change her behaviour. LOL, what kind of bullshit is this???

TLDR: You clearly contradict your own post with statements you typed earlier. You can't even be consistent with your words. What a joke.

BTW I totally agree with the top comment on this post...Self promotion shouldn't be allowed on this sub."
4641,2020-12-12 15:54:15,kbmt1x,Self promotiom shouldnt be allowed on this sub
4642,2020-12-12 15:02:53,kbmt1x,This sounds like victim blaming/shaming
4643,2020-12-12 13:47:08,kbmt1x,It is not your fault people are bad and treat you poorly. You basically just said that it’s a rape victims fault that they got raped because they allowed it.
4644,2020-12-12 13:23:47,kbmt1x,"When my college friends started mistreating me at some point I tried talking and asking for them to stop with their problematic behavior. They would agree to be better but continued with their behavior. I distanced myself and left. After graduating I worked on myself for a while, then they saw my improvement. Tried approaching and acting nice to me like nothing happened. As much as I would be tempted to go back and be close again as we once were before, had to tell myself No. If I go back there may just be this pattern of mistreatment, me distancing myself, them kissing up, I go back, then cycle. If my distance from them is what will get them to treat me decently then so be it. We're not meant to be close, it was only temporary until they showed their true colors. I personally don't want to cut off people unless they've truly been terrible, which they haven't been on that level. But they have treated me bad enough where I don't want to be around them much anymore. They got their own problems to deal with. Also thank you for this article, I'll be saving it to my bookmarks :-)"
4645,2020-12-12 15:43:45,kbmt1x,"This is easily something I assume responsibility for. I've never been able to say no in relationships. I've always been taught that I'm supposed to make a girl happy, that I'm supposed to give her the world, and never thinking to even consider what I want.

Ive been working on it, and it's funnily enough taken another female friend of mine to teach me that you can't allow people to take advantage of you or get away with treating you a way you don't appreciate.

Now I have a slightly different problem; I'm so worried that if I do say something, no, or disagree, or bring up a problem of mine or whatever, my potential partner will simply just drop me and find someone else, as the dating scene in society is very...well, easy to maximize your potential dates with the tools available.

Anyways, great post, it's genuinely helped me better understand the perspective my problem gives to others, and it makes me feel good knowing it's something people other than myself understand. Makes me feel less alone in this personal struggle.

Thank you, friend."
4646,2020-12-12 15:44:07,kbmt1x,"i definitely see this but it's hard to express this kind of thing without immediately jumping to victim shaming. I have a friend with a horribly manipulative ""friend"" and all I hear about is how shit they've been and what the new shittiest thing they've done is and I can't help but feel like this post sums it up. It's the ""he's going to therapy he'll get better"" tied with just avoiding confrontation or immediately conceding and spending money for them as some sick sense of apology. How do you even casually express this kind of thing?"

4659,2020-12-12 15:14:40,kbmt1x,It’s just my opinion but I believe that of teaching people how to treat others should not fall on the person being approached; it should fall on the approacher.

I've recently had to suffer a manager who mistreated me, and it's been playing on my mind, wondering what I could have done about it. My reaction I suppose was passive. I just got on with my work to the best of my ability, which is how I've always reacted in these situations. Nothing changed, of course.  

He's gone now, but next time I can refer back to this post."
4668,2020-12-12 09:07:37,kbksqb,wow. wish i had this back then. i had “friends” mistreating me because i was very shy and didn’t stand up for myself. i taught them how to treat me.
4669,2020-12-17 13:10:49,kbksqb,"I’m having flashbacks to childhood when I’d tell my mom that my brother was mistreating me and she’d tell me that “he only does it to get a reaction out of you. If you ignore it, it’ll go away”, while doing nothing to reprimand him. And I think a lot of people are raised with the delusion that simply ignoring someone will somehow make them stop— so thank you for explaining how that definitely does not work, because I always felt like a failure for being unable to avoid reacting, which shifts the problem off of the aggressor and onto the mistreated person for daring to have feelings about being mistreated.

I don’t talk to my brother anymore, by the way."

4679,2021-01-20 03:23:33,kn3zmg,"The Passive is workable, but limits how she can be played, due to requiring high Protections for full effect. On the other hand, due to Base Protections, she already gets at least 4% Mitigation and 8% Movement Speed constantly at Level 20, which is still significantly powerful for a constant Buff.

The Damage on the 1 is abysmal. Otherwise, it's workable. Don't know why hitting someone with your shield would Heal you though.

The 2 is not exceptionally helpful. The Stun is nice, but if the shield can be broken and does no Damage, it's worse than Nike's 2. Against a Hunter lategame, the wall would be gone super quick.

The 3 is... iffy. You can't cancel non-channelled Abilities in the middle of their execution. You can't stop Kukulkan's Ult or Ra's Ult short, because they have predetermined areas of effect and can go through walls. Also, gaining further Mitigation is on top of Protections that also give more Mitigation, is ridiculous.

The Ult is problematic. Being able to give a shield to your Allies anywhere on the map allows you to turn the tide of any teamfight without even being present, and save your teammates when normally there would be no way to.

Overall, despite having some broken Abilities, this character is useless. She is a Guardian who has almost no Damage. The Ability to deal Damage is essential to winning any match. If she can't even clear wave by herself at Level 20, she has a serious problem. Any character that is helpless by themself cannot function well in Smite."

4834,2021-01-07 06:50:20,kmiq82,"To add more info-- Black & Blue was recorded in 9 days (as per Brian), and riding off Millennium, Jive's aim was probably just to make Millennium 2.0, which possibly explains Kevin's comments. 

To the fans, this lost album era is known as the ""Dirty Little Secrets"" era (though the boys themselves don't seem to know this/call it that). This was probably after news that a song of the same name had been brought by AJ to Barry Weiss of Jive, and that it was set to be one of the singles off the new album. The intial direction of the album was more urban contemporary, but Jive vetoed all of this because it was ""too urban"". In the $75 million lawsuit the band filed against Zomba (Jive's parent company) in November 2002, they stated that Zomba ""refused to actively participate in the selection of songs or producers and rejected, in bad faith, artistic suggestions made by [the group]."" Some of the names being tossed around at this time were Jermaine Dupri, Soulshock & Karlin, Glenn Ballard, Linda Perry, Peter Gabriel, Brandon O'Brien, duets with Shakira and Christina Aguilera... Movin' On (bonus track off NG) was also written around this time by Howie and Wade Robson. I believe Poster Girl and Song for the Unloved was also from around this 2002-ish era.

Their (renegotiated in 1999) contract with Zomba included non-returnable advances for delivering albums, which included a $5 million payment if the album after B&B was delivered by 30 April 2002. They alleged that because of the above, and because Zomba/Jive started prioritising Nick's solo album as you stated (and the loophole the utilised), it made it impossible for them to actually deliver on that album. They also alleged that the label was using BSB to promote Nick (by redirecting them from the BSB site to Nick's site). Nick was part of this lawsuit against the label as well.

Bits and pieces about this lost album came out throughout 2002, various combinations of band members are seen together throughout the year, Nick's solo album comes out, various band members are seen at different places supporting his solo project, Brian and Leighanne have Baylee, Kevin is announced to join the Broadway cast of Chicago, etc. As you said, they met in March 2003 for about a week, but then shortly after that they released a statement that said that the album was on hold for now while they pursue their own projects. Nick was still on tour at this time, and the rest of them were again seen in various combinations throughout the year or at their own things, but I don't think they weren't seen together as a group again until they surprised AJ on Oprah in November 2003."
4835,2021-03-19 16:37:41,kmiq82,"Uhm I dont think therr is anything much they can do at the time. I think Jive did everything they could already with BSB. Pop Boy/Girl bands have a lifespan of mostly 3-4 years, 5 if they are lucky of stable album sales. Its really rare to see them outlive this period. With Teen Pop girls/boys solo acts its easy to grow their image. Just use sex in their music, ala Britney and you can retain your fans to a certain extent. When it comes to group, its much2 harder to grow and retain their fans. I believe even if they did release this lost album they had that were never released. They will still suffers a big huge drop in album sales."
4836,2021-02-03 20:19:21,kmiq82,"It's impossible B&B was recorded in 9 days. I don't even believe Brian would say such a thing. If he did, he definitely misspoke. That can't be true."
4837,2021-01-16 02:44:12,kmiq82,"Lived history.  It's so weird how I vividly remember all of this from various TRL/MTV interviews and internet searches after school. I'd keep checking to see signs of life from them. They disappeared on me in high school and left me to discover Linkin Park, Nirvana, Disturbed and Eminem. I got angrier with every year lol. Then all of a sudden I heard the second verse of I Just Want You To Know on some website and they were back. Or close to being back. And my depression felt magically lifted, I felt so light again. Hadn't felt it in 3 years."
4838,2021-02-04 01:54:23,kmiq82,"Just saying what he was quoted as saying [here](https://ew.com/music/2017/02/22/backstreet-boys-oral-history/):
> BRIAN: The managers would say, “If you don’t say yes to this, I’m going to get *NSYNC to do it.”

> KEVIN: We toured Millennium for a little bit, not as much as we could; then we went right back and did another album [2000’s Black & Blue].

Your journey is certainly a unique one (to put it very mildly :p), to be from a Latino background and then move into this completely separate world, to spend decades as a Salafi Muslim to the extent of being able to meet and study under Al-Fawzan and then to come back from it all at the risk of losing everything. I can't fill a room but I wish I could shake your hand (or maybe offer a hug?) It would have been do easy for someone your age to let the inertia of life just carry you forward and lock your doubts away in a corner of your mind. Particularly after being so steeped in the most conservative branch of Islam existing today and being part of its tight knit community. It must take an incredible amount of bravery and honesty to do what you have done. From halfway around the world (Karachi, Pakistan), from someone who was born Muslim but left it at age younger than the period of time you were in the faith and never committed to it half as much you did, you have my utmost respect."

4863,2020-12-29 17:49:50,kmb5nt,"Thank you for your comment. Great questions. 

What made me think Islam was right? Probably because of my Catholic background, I bought into the finality of Islam over all of the other religions. It superficially answered the tougher questions Catholics cannot answer. Or so I thought...which brings me to the second question:

I explored this on my blog where I spoke about [the top ten reasons why I left Salafi Islam](https://offdamanhaj.blogspot.com/2019/06/top-10-reasons-why-i-left-salafi-islam.html) with the gist being #1: the concept of Allah in Islam is too human and too much the Prophet's alter ego. Especially when one reads the Asbaab works, it's very clear that a divine being was not speaking to him. 

I plan to elaborate further on my YouTube channel from the aspect of cognitive grammar. Not sure when I will finalize it, but I may post it here when I actually do.

Being Catholic was like being Muslim, good and bad, ups and downs,etc. All of those experiences were human ones that are not exclusive to religion. But, I spent more years as a Muslim than as a Catholic as I converted when I was 18 years old. 

I did take many positives from both experience and religion, I learned how human religion really is. I learned that religion (even though it is a word many still cannot agree to define) is best observed when it is personal and when it is meant only to do good. The minute it crosses over into violence, control, shitty reasoning, then it becomes something else.

I've seen a few videos of Daud Kim, and in my personal opinion, I think he has some genuine interest in the religion of Islam but struggles since he comes from a secular background (Korea, like USA, being largely secular). I dont completely buy that he only converted for fans."
4871,2020-12-30 03:44:58,kmb5nt,"Speaking on something I knew a little more about, namely Muslims in the West, there's this Instagramer named falafel.kimchi that's a Canadian convert of Korean descent. He posts many videos about being a Korean guy who's Muslim and integrated into Arab culture. The dude speaks Arabic fluently.

He annoys the hell out of me, but admittedly, it's partially out of jealousy since I can't speak Arabic even though I've been around a lot of Arabs too. Although, I'm mostly annoyed because almost all of his videos have one gimmick, namely that he's a KOREAN guy who's MUSLIM and knows about ARABI culture. I get the feeling the dude found Islam through an appreciation of Arab culture.

Is there a similarity with diaspora Koreans who convert to Islam and Koreans from Korea? maybe."

What is it Asbaab?

I've read the ten points of your link but it could be from someone who is still muslim albeit not a Salafi. I have the feeling that Salafism is going to decline after the problems of Quranic preservation and criticism of Hadiths, what do you think about it?  


> Stay gold. 

I like this :)"
4873,2020-12-30 00:38:17,kmb5nt,"Thank you for the comment.

*Asbaab* works is short for *Asbaab-un-Nuzool* or the Causes for Revelation. I made a video for it [here](https://offdamanhaj.blogspot.com/2020/12/youtube-video-introduction-to-asbaab-un.html).

Understood about how some could interpret that I am still aMuslim. I am ex-Muslim, agnostic-atheist.

I think that Salafism will survive for some time since it is becoming a *madhhab* within itself. What will eventually happen is that it will become so mainstream that it will become a lot like Haredi Judaism.

""Stay gold"" is a quote from the novel *The Outsiders* by S.E Hinton. In the movie adaptation, it pays tribute to the poem *Nothing Gold Can Stay* written by Robert Frost when one of the main characters, Ponyboy, recites it. When Ponyboy's best friend, Johnny, is dying of burn wounds, he tells Ponyboy to ""Stay gold."" It is a metaphor to live life to the fullest as life is too short.

4879,2020-12-30 01:46:25,klrofi,"I definitely want to say that each ability stands out as creative and definitely accomplishes high defense. I think that there are a few basic things to comment on and then some balance things 

First things first, I think the mana costs are very high. Most basic abilities cost right around 50 - 60 Mana at R1 and scale to between 75 and 90 by their maximum rank. Ultimate abilities can vary, but generally speaking they cost 100 - 110. Exceeding 100 Mana, particularly on a basic ability is very, *very* costly 

Another general comment is that each ability should have something that improves with rank. As it stands, the only thing that increases with The Living Shield is its cost, meaning that Brynhildr would only ever be harmed by leveling the ability up

Lastly, most basic ability cooldowns range from sub-10 to right around 18 at the higher end of the spectrum. While there are examples of basic abilities with long cooldowns, like Geb's Stone Shield and Terra's Monolith, I'd caution you about setting an ability to be 25s. While The Living Shield does a lot of really strong things for Brynhildr, a similar ability seems to be Achilles's Radiant Glory, which only has a cooldown of ten seconds. Should The Living Shield be ten seconds, I can't really tell. But 25s seems very long and I think it hurts Brynhildr in the long run 

*On to balance* 

Loving the passive, though I do have a question and a suggestion. Does the passive discern between Physical + Magical Protections and Mitigation? Is it for every 50 Physical Protections, Brynhildr gains 3% Physical Mitigation? Or is it for every 50 total protections, she gains 3% mitigation? And then my suggestion is that a constant 21% Movement Speed seems like very much; by comparison Mercury only receives 2/4/6/8/10% and Nike receives 2%. Looking up other values, Amaterasu gets up to 21%, Ra gets 18% and Bellona gets 15%, but these gods have to pay into this movement speed with mana or by being in combat. I think the trend for just *here's X movemet speed* falls lower, so I would probably tune this down. Maybe 2% for every 500 Health, or 3% stacking five times? 

Shield Bash is good, but the health is very, very strong. Having a straight up heal is extremely potent on a god that specializes so much in defense, and percentage based healing on top of that seems to be extreme. SWK, for example, has percentage based healing on his ultimate, and can recover 25% over five seconds on a 90s cooldown. Vamana can recover 30% over six seconds on a 90s cooldown. Brynhildr can recover 30% by hitting three enemies on a 10s cooldown, in addition to a disarm, potential stun, and damage. I would recommend either removing the heal, replacing it with a flat heal, or replacing it with a percent *missing* health, like Sol and Baron Samedi have 

Shield Wall has some good ideas, but I do dislike when gods are penalized for using abilities. Tacking on a 50% healing reduction is kinda :/ 

Other than that, I think having an average shield health is the way to go here. Geb's shield used to scale with his health and that was a *nightmare* and was patched out very, very quickly. To give you an idea, a lot of Warrior and Guardian shields can hit right around 300 to 650 as a ballpark

The Living Shield is interesting. It needs something to be leveled; and easy fix would be to begin at around 20 protections and scale up to the 60. The mitigation is *steep*; by comparison Osiris gets around half that from his passive. Erlang Shen gets half of that from his ultimate. I'd say you could probably go without mitigation here since there is a lot from her passive, and having two sources of damage mitigation is...a lot. The ability also activates a stack through her passive, so really it's 33% immediately. I see that it's a pricey ability and that it's on a very long cooldown, but having an ability that is balanced around not being able to be used reliably is iffy 

Pulling an Oprah (hehe) is in my opinion okie dokie, though it could benefit from a maximum duration, maybe 8 to 10s 

I think there are a lot of really great ideas and a ton of creativity though! I definitely don't want to sound like I'm ripping to rip <3"
4880,2020-12-28 14:56:05,klrofi,This concept is amazing! I really love her kit and how she's a protector. I hope they add her into the game!

4884,2020-12-28 17:05:32,klrj57,"The Passive is problematic. By default, she'd be getting 6% Mitigations and 12% Movement Speed at Max. Level. That's a hefty Buff to have constantly, and to have even more is crazy.

The 1 is problematic. A 10% Heal for hitting an Enemy god, on a 10 second Cooldown, makes her able to survive teamfights almost indefinitely, especially with her Mitigations. It's not fun to play against a character that doesn't seem like they're taking Damage. Also, the earlygame Damage is a bit high, but the lategame Damage is very low. Also, having a Movement Ability on a 10 second Cooldown is a no-go. That makes her almost impossible to lock down, adding to the annoyance of not being able to kill her.

The 2 is problematic. Being able to Dash during this negates any Movement Speed limitation. Also, a 3 second Stun is much too long. With the exception of Chang'e's Ult under certain conditions, no Ability Stuns that long.

The 3 is especially problematic. 30% Mitigation, and 60 of each Protections, *and* Knockback and Root Immunity, *and* Cooldown Reduction is insane. This Ability ensures that she can't be killed, and sets her up for another Dash or Stun. Not fun.

The Ult is problematic. Being able to make your teammates unkillable from anywhere on the map is not fun. You double their Health and give them massive Protections, they win every fight.

Overall, this kit is just not fun to play against. She can't be killed, she can't be locked down, and she can make her team win every teamfight wherever she is on the map. How would you like to play against a character like that?

I suggest you look at the kits of characters already in the game, to get an idea of Damage, Cooldowns, limitations, interactions, CCs, durations, and so on."
4885,2020-12-28 16:10:32,klrj57,That just sounds busted
4886,2020-12-28 16:09:55,klrj57,Absolutely fucking broken
4887,2020-12-28 16:34:38,klrj57,"The one and two remind me of Steel from Paragon, the three is a cool concept but would need less mitigation or not work on AOE, and the ultimate is busted.

The ultimate shield could feasibly give about a 1500hp shield and 100+ of each protection globally late game. (50% of a hunter at 1500-2000hp, and 25% of Bryn health at 3000+hp). And the enemy has to kill the entire shield, it doesn't disappear.

edit: by AOE I mean circles such as Pos whirlpool and ult, I like the idea of being able to bodyblock straight line ults like Ra or Anhur"
4888,2020-12-28 22:17:53,klrj57,"sounds like a really fun idea of another shield like character, I love Nike's 2, and the teamfight focus seems like it could be a blast, even if a bit overtuned"
4889,2020-12-29 00:28:59,klrj57,"Of course this is your design so take everything I say with a grain of salt.

Passive) Movement speed is a very very powerful stat that should be given very sparingly. I'd recommend toning down the movement speed to 8% if you keep it at all.

1) I believe that Brynhildr in design should be quick, but immobile, and very difficult to take down. Therefore I'd recommend replacing the dash for a cone similar to Nike 2. Also I believe the proper term for being unable to auto-attack is disarm.

2) Well designed, but 3s is a very long stun in a team fight for a basic ability. I'd recommend the stun go 1-2 seconds but would require play testing for proper balance

3) The ability to stop piercing abilities sounds like a fantastic idea, however the aoe block is probably a bit much

4) You have to be careful with global abilities, I'd recommend the shield have an expiration timer of 7s and only give shields based on the target or the caster, not both

Overall I love the idea and would love to play this, but definitely needs a bit more fine tuning"
4890,2020-12-28 17:34:47,klrj57,"You’ve got a point, I’d probably hate my life playing against her. Thanks for the critique, I’ll try and crank out something more balanced next time!"
4891,2020-12-28 16:30:46,klrj57,"So she’s perfect for a new release! /s

But in all seriousness, what could I tone down here?"
4892,2020-12-28 17:33:21,klrj57,"Thanks for the critique! Maybe the ult could fade out after, say, 10 seconds?"
4893,2020-12-28 16:31:54,klrj57,"I didn’t mean to sound rude, however the three second aoe stun is insane and the mechanic of negating somebody’s ult makes for a fun killing experience"
4894,2020-12-28 19:09:02,klrj57,"10s is still long enough to make it overpowered. Geb shield length scales from 3s to 5s that would be a good starting point, but still probably too strong, It just gives too much health and protections.

This concept is interesting and I'd probably have fun playing her, but all of her abilities are overpowered.

Edit: That much health is essentially an aegis for all squishy roles that they can attack for the duration"

I wish all the Best in the world❤️"
4917,2020-12-27 14:16:50,kkznce,"Thank you for this. 

I really needed somebody to tell me the words which were somewhere deep in my mind.

Happy 2021 Year and I wish you the best life possible in this world :D"
4918,2020-12-27 23:46:04,kkznce,"Thank you for this! I’m still working on myself and I don’t actively put anyone else down. But when I am around someone who I perceive to be doing better than me, it makes me feel self conscious and not confident in myself, even if that person is so close to me and I know isn’t looking down at me at all. I’m doing small things to better myself everyday, and being aware of my thoughts. Sometimes a lot of my thoughts are wrong assumptions, and I never learned to manage them well cause I didn’t get sound advice or good role models in my life. But I am starting therapy soon! Do you have any tips for people on the other side trying to overcome themselves? lol I know we only have the answers in ourselves but if you do I’m happy to listen!"
4919,2020-12-28 03:53:14,kkznce,"Basically, accept their behavior but act in a way that shows that it's their problem not yours and leave them to it."

4922,2020-12-28 14:38:20,kkznce,"Outside-Instruction3, I understand. Comparing yourself to others is not necessarily a good thing to do. We all live different lives and we are at different stages in our lives too. So essentially, more often than not we compare apples to pears. Keep things simple, compare yourself to yourself only. Look at your life objectively."
4923,2020-12-28 15:00:26,kkznce,"i gotcha, thank u for the response. i watched a video yesterday called “the best life advice you ever heard is probably wrong,” and its about a guy that travels all around the world to ask different people what living a good life means. everyone had different answers and eventually conflicted each other. it worked for them, but it didn’t necessarily mean it would work for everyone else."
4924,2020-12-27 00:29:27,kkt8xs,"Holy shit PragerU is extremely racist and bigoted... like, EXTREMELY alt-right. Yikes on bikes. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

Edited to add: isn’t “Save the Children” a Q Anon thing??? Holy SHIT"
4925,2020-12-27 00:41:04,kkt8xs,I think this may be important to post on the main sub as well
4926,2020-12-27 00:37:26,kkt8xs,"Why doesn’t the producers look into this shit themselves? I doubt we’re gonna get another Rachel/Lee situation on our hands, but this makes me feel weird inside"
4927,2020-12-27 01:53:16,kkt8xs,"Thank you for posting this, this was extremely informative. I'm from a nearby area (and have relatives in Cumming), but because I'm more used to the Desi community in Southern Forsyth, I'm more ignorant about the county's racist history than I would have liked. 

I'd also like to add that Forsyth County is also where [Tamla Horsford,](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/black-womans-party-death-renewed-scrutiny-georgia-72934547) a BWOC, died during a sleepover with several friends in 2018. A new investigation was opened this fall, as her relatives believe foul play was involved--->!defensive wounds were found in the autopsy, along with high levels of Xanax, marijuana, and alcohol!<. I don't think a racial motive has been alleged/confirmed but the friends in question were all white, and it wouldn't be out of place in Forsyth's history unfortunately.

If Rachael's confirmed as F1, I'm not sure if I'll continue watching Matt's season past hometowns (or whenever the last WOC's eliminated)."
4928,2020-12-27 00:31:21,kkt8xs,Sounds like a town straight out of my nightmares. Thanks for the heads up.
4929,2020-12-27 02:05:07,kkt8xs,"This is a second hand story but I knew a couple girls who played softball in north Georgia in middle school. They were supposed to play a game in Forsyth county once, but they never got to play the game because the Forsyth team wouldn’t let the black girls on their team onto the field. This was in like 2012. I’m from Savannah and we’ve always been told that it’s an insane place."

4931,2020-12-27 13:49:49,kkt8xs,How does the bachelor find these people honestly... its so disturbing
4932,2020-12-27 01:08:56,kkt8xs,"Wow. Incredibly fucked up. The evidence you’ve compiled convinces me - at the very least, this is not a woman who should be given access to a black man who will already be under scrutiny."
4933,2020-12-27 01:12:43,kkt8xs,They will only drag you on the main sub so don't even bother tbh.
4934,2020-12-28 17:44:57,kkt8xs,"Listen, if he wanna be in the sunken place let him. Let's all manifest a pic/bipoc 'ette in 2021"
4935,2020-12-30 07:32:14,kkt8xs,"Guess who is now following BLM & black owned businesses 🙂 Rachael must have followed the 2 IGs earlier Tues because she was not following them as of late Monday night. Do you all think she got wind of OP’s posting here or is this purely coincidental?  
Edit - Typos"
4936,2020-12-27 01:12:00,kkt8xs,"Thanks for sharing. I speculated on another thread that she may have been accused of being not into black men by one of the other girls on the show based on the preview of her discussing with Matt on how she does not see color and love is love (paraphrasing), that is just so random to bring up IMO. It’s one of the reasons I am not convinced she is F1 quite yet despite that spoiler account speculating that she is, we shall see."
4937,2020-12-27 04:40:17,kkt8xs,If she's Matt F1 this confirms all my suspicions about him.
4938,2020-12-27 01:17:11,kkt8xs,So I get what you are saying and optics wise this looks horrible. But ngl if Matt actually picked her then he probably doesn’t care and may carry some of her beliefs. Just look at his background. Don’t put this on the main sub.
4939,2020-12-27 13:27:40,kkt8xs,I go to Atlanta a lot to visit family and I’ve heard about that town .
4940,2020-12-27 06:11:53,kkt8xs,"Wow, Matt sure can pick them.  😟"
4941,2020-12-27 01:56:36,kkt8xs,"So I read this and I was ready to pick up a pitchfork but I went and checked out her IG and I have to say there's a bit of cherry-picking here to support your hypothesis. She could very well be racist/and have bought into QAnon which is very troubling of course, but the couple of posts you highlighted in the link above doesn't tell the complete picture. Far be it for me to defend her, but she certainly has several other posts in that same highlight reel that seems to suggest she's at the minimum not completely oblivious of broader social issues. 

Is she the most woke person out there, definitely not, but this post gives off the impression that she's the next Yarrett. My suggestion is for everyone to go take a look at her [highlight reel](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17858172731288920/) and come to your own conclusion based on that, not simply based off this post."
4942,2020-12-27 02:34:59,kkt8xs,"Rachael's posts are not like Yarrett's, but there are some that are definitely concerning and problematic. She didn't do anything for Blackout Tuesday, doesn't look like she attended any protests, donated any money, publicly state how she would better educate herself, etc. And now she is *very* likely engaged to our first Black bachelor.

I also went to Rachael's Facebook page after Patty followed her and I saw she had Trump in her Likes. I should've screenshot it at the time because now she of course hid everything, dammit.

I hope this makes it to the main sub before everyone starts stanning her."
4943,2020-12-27 08:12:16,kkt8xs,"I wonder if she isn’t F1... I just looked at her profile and she was tagged on December 6th at some kind of costume party presumably. It’s in her tagged photos, she’s dressed with another couple as dumb & dumber"
4944,2020-12-27 23:24:46,kkt8xs,I recently became familiar with Forsyth after diving down the rabbit hole of Tamla Horsford’s death.
4945,2020-12-31 01:55:11,kkt8xs,"Can someone post this in the main group? I honestly feel like she's going to be the F1 from the spoilers I know of, and now I'm realizing why Matt got casted as bachelor if that's the case :/"
4946,2020-12-27 05:14:27,kkt8xs,"Y”all, I just watched the Oprah segment from 1987 that OP linked and I am freaking out thinking someone from Rachael’s family might be in the footage!!!!! I hope this is not case as I am not ready for this again considering the producers put a racist on Rachel’s Bette season knowing he had those problematic tweets in the public domain. And I won’t be shocked if producers dug into Forsyth county since they cast Rachael from there. I am so shook right now and for the love of all things good, I am hoping Matt picked someone else!!!! Thanks again OP and others that have shared more on this."
4947,2020-12-27 08:30:51,kkt8xs,"I was curious and looked up the most recent election results for the county.. and yikes yikes yikes. 

https://results.enr.clarityelections.com/GA/Forsyth/105428/web.264614/#/summary?v=264620%2F"
4948,2020-12-27 03:03:30,kkt8xs,It feels...icky to cast someone like this for a lead of color in the midst of a national reckoning on police brutality.
4949,2020-12-27 03:34:13,kkt8xs,"oooooof my aunt lives there currently, not shocked by this at all :("
4950,2020-12-27 02:24:23,kkt8xs,This is absolutely terrifying. I know Matt is no saint but I sure hope he doesn’t end up engaged to this woman.
4951,2020-12-27 03:36:58,kkt8xs,"Oh holy shit. Thanks for bringing all this up to our attention. Good to know when watching. People on the main sub are already trying to ""stan"" her without even seeing anything, just because of spoilers."
4952,2021-01-05 21:21:40,kkt8xs,she is BAD VIBESSSSS yuuuck
4953,2021-02-03 07:01:36,kkt8xs,[removed]
4954,2020-12-27 00:49:19,kkt8xs,"Yes, it is something loosely started by QAnon. QAnon is incredibly popular with people in that area of Georgia. They’re geographically close to the district that elected Marjorie Taylor Greene, which says a lot."
4955,2021-02-25 10:28:46,kkt8xs,"Save the children is intentionally benign to bring in new followers and make Qanon appear more reasonable than it is. You can’t recruit people if you open with “lizard cabal” so you say “save the children” instead. It’s also easier to get hashtags like “save the children” trending on Twitter which can make people more aware of their conspiracies. The real question is whether or not she was aware that “save the children” is a dog whistle. Given her history, I think she must have been aware—at the very least—that radical and extremist right media figures say save the children a *lot*."
4956,2020-12-27 00:44:55,kkt8xs,"I’m highly considering it, but I know the main sub can be less than receptive to something like this. Another user suggested I wait until Rancid Sushi confirms her as F1, which I’m inclined to do.

ETA: I think I will share this before the premiere so that people can see it before they decide to stan her"
4957,2020-12-27 00:41:38,kkt8xs,"The producers definitely have a history of casting people who are SO clearly racist, I wish I could say I’m surprised this happened. I’m horrified they let him choose her though. Matt deserves better than to get engaged to a girl with (most likely) racist parents."
4958,2020-12-27 04:59:41,kkt8xs,I’m just thankful that there is no traveling to hometowns and we didn’t have to see her and Matt on their day date in Forsyth. Ugh from OP’s description of the town I’d be so scared being there as a POC and also having to watch Matt walk around in the town🥺 shame on the producers for letting this happen!!
4959,2020-12-27 00:39:41,kkt8xs,"I've got some opinions on this and I know it's not right to speculate without proof but based on this information alone, I wouldn't be surprised at all if she had a racist past that'll come out."
4960,2020-12-27 00:41:20,kkt8xs,"I’m sure they knew...  The producers don’t care about people they care about ratings and whatever will get the most people conned into watching the same shit time and time again.  If it means destroying lives in the process so be it.  That’s not to say some people deserve a kick in the pants, but no one deserves to be used and abused the way reality television producers use contestants."
4961,2020-12-27 01:57:52,kkt8xs,"Wow. I cannot believe I forgot to include Tamla’s death. I’ve read about it, and I definitely believe it was racially motivated. If I do post this in the main sub I will have to include that as well. 

I want to watch this season because I want to help the ratings so that TPTB will hopefully cast more diverse leads going forward, but wow does it seem like I’m not going to enjoy it."
4962,2021-01-23 19:16:00,kkt8xs,"I had no idea this was the same county, I feel sick reading about Tamla’s story. Rachael is really inexcusable for tptb to have casted. I don’t really feel like finishing the show at all now. Has she been confirmed f1?"
4963,2020-12-27 02:06:05,kkt8xs,"That doesn’t surprise me at all, I definitely believe them."
4964,2020-12-27 12:18:45,kkt8xs,I was gonna bring up a similar story from 2010. Ain’t shit changed imo
4965,2020-12-27 07:23:36,kkt8xs,How does that look today? Would the same thing happen?
4966,2020-12-27 09:30:14,kkt8xs,ugh i agree and it sucks
4967,2020-12-27 06:22:46,kkt8xs,This.
4968,2020-12-30 14:40:44,kkt8xs,"She also took the PragerU post off her Instagram highlights. I doubt she caught wind of this post, but she’s probably trying to cover her bases ahead of the premier."
4969,2020-12-27 04:56:06,kkt8xs,What are your suspicions?
4970,2020-12-27 02:05:27,kkt8xs,I definitely did not want to encourage people to go after her. I also did not mean for this to read like she’s the next Yarrett. I simply wanted to bring awareness to some things most people might not know about. I apologize if this post came across as misleading.
4971,2020-12-27 02:48:48,kkt8xs,No shade but im not sure our first black bachelor believes any differently than her so welp......
4972,2020-12-27 02:58:23,kkt8xs,"But what she does have In her highlight reel are the following:
1) A message defining white privilege
2) 2 other posts that link to concrete steps to take beyond posting on Social Media
3) Another message about how silence allows hate to grow
4) A message about why it’s a privilege to educate yourself about racism which links to a message about the need to have uncomfortable conversations 
5) A video from Patrice Washington that talks about her experiences and is explicitly addressed to white people and suggests they need to take a side. 

I hate being put in this position of having to seemingly defend her when I don’t know her but I reserve my disdain and judgment for someone who is very clearly racist or has hateful views e.g. homophobia. 

Could she have done more? Absolutely and the jury for me is still out on her but i don’t really see how someone who might seemingly have problematic views would even take the time out to post those things. Maybe I’m just being naive."
4973,2020-12-27 16:30:52,kkt8xs,Filming ended on november 21.
4974,2020-12-31 02:00:39,kkt8xs,"As much as I want to share this there, I’m not prepared for the amount of kickback from the people who will inevitably defend her."
4975,2020-12-27 05:22:47,kkt8xs,"The video is truly chilling. The first time I saw it, I realized just how bad the lies I’d grown up believing were."
4976,2021-01-05 15:19:48,kkt8xs,They know better.
4977,2021-01-05 15:19:30,kkt8xs,Matt isn’t racist so I definitely don’t want him to end up with someone who may be.
4978,2020-12-27 18:38:39,kkt8xs,"If you scroll through the rest of her highlights, there are multiple anti-racism stories. This post isn't really giving an accurate picture. I think we should wait until we meet her before we judge her."
4979,2020-12-27 07:29:38,kkt8xs,whats the premise of this “save the children” campaign?
4980,2020-12-27 00:48:31,kkt8xs,"That does sound like the best course of action! Hoping he doesn’t take forever to confirm end game spoilers this time around. 

I just think that people should have this info, especially regarding her highlights."
4981,2020-12-27 05:01:50,kkt8xs,"Regardless of what pos RS has to say and whether she’s F1 or not, she still got casted on this season and clearly makes it far enough to be in F1 consideration 😒 that still makes me mad"
4982,2021-01-05 21:22:55,kkt8xs,"hi, bumping this up in case you’re still hoping to post about it on the main subreddit! 

you were ahead of the curve with this post esp with the tik tok expose!"
4983,2020-12-27 18:02:29,kkt8xs,Matt *has* a racist parent.
4984,2020-12-27 18:39:16,kkt8xs,"If you scroll through the rest of her highlights, there are multiple anti-racism stories. This post isn't really giving an accurate picture. You only cherry picked the two stories that could be construed as problematic in a vacuum. Why didn't you share any of her anti-racism stories as well? I think we should wait until we meet her before we judge her."
4985,2020-12-27 00:42:46,kkt8xs,I just hope WW who come from places like this aren’t using this opportunity for their personal growth and giving themselves pats on the back for being ‘woke’ enough to try dating a black guy.
4986,2020-12-27 00:46:10,kkt8xs,"You’re not the only one. Her Instagram is her only public social media account, which is strange for an influencer to say the least."
4987,2020-12-28 17:47:51,kkt8xs,"Listen , the day that info drops both subreddit  will be on fire"
4988,2020-12-27 00:47:40,kkt8xs,"I was just acknowledging how glad I was that a racist or colourist wasn’t on Tayshia’s season this morning and now I feel like boo boo the fool. Reminds me of every time a white friend would invite me to their place and warn me that their parents are racist/islamaphobic right before I went over lol it isn’t fun drama, it’s exhausting and I want no part in seeing it"
4989,2020-12-27 02:15:45,kkt8xs,"Right?! He wasn't my first choice, but I liked that the cast was diverse & some of these women have interesting careers too like! Between the trailer & his F1 possibly being racist, I'm not excited for this season ugh."
4990,2021-01-23 19:28:21,kkt8xs,"Unfortunately, yes---both from spoiler accounts & some sleuthers on the main sub saw that Matt was using her Spotify playlists (based on their lack of social media activity, it was interpreted that they were on a safe house visit)

But I feel that, I haven't watched last week's EP and I'm not sure if I'll watch the rest."
4991,2020-12-27 02:07:49,kkt8xs,Me too. Not saying Rachael is like that but.... it’s pretty common in Forsyth. It would be more surprising if she WASN’T like that.
4992,2020-12-27 07:31:21,kkt8xs,ugh that makes me so sad
4993,2020-12-27 05:11:50,kkt8xs,That he's like a lot of biracial men I met that suffer from self-hate and are comfortable with white folks that hold racist views. Can seem like a stretch but I've met to many men like Matt.
4994,2020-12-27 02:15:37,kkt8xs,"I appreciate your response and definitely don't want to go back and forth, but also I'm not trying to defend her especially because I don't know her and time will tell - she could very well have problematic views. But I think we all need to be really careful how we  present information that could potentially malign someone's character. These are highly-charged issues and sometimes once you've put it out there, it's harder to take back so that's all I wanted to bring attention to."
4995,2020-12-27 03:21:58,kkt8xs,"Thanks for looking that up. It's not fair to judge her based off the city where she's from, times may have changed, and she may not think like the rest of her town, like OP himself/herself. Ripping her and Matt for the rest of her city, as well as her facebook likes isn't conclusive to her being a racist monster."
4996,2020-12-28 18:19:09,kkt8xs,"I saw those post and yeah,you have a point. Let's all work together to not judge her so harshly and give her a chance when this info (inevitably) comes up in the press."
4997,2020-12-27 19:28:41,kkt8xs,If she’s engaged to matt I’d assume she’s not posing at a party with other guys? But who knows i guess
4998,2020-12-31 02:01:19,kkt8xs,"ugh that frustrates me. maybe when she’s final 1, someone else will post it. or maybe even sooner."
4999,2020-12-27 23:24:35,kkt8xs,"They think there’s a large conspiracy to traffic children throughout the world. See the Hillary Clinton pizzagate scandal and the wayfair debacle to more about that. 

(Because I can’t help myself: Q followers believe that wayfair’s most expensive furniture was a front for trafficking children. They had/have pieces that have human names so for example, they thought you could buy a Heather for $20,000 from the site. It’s insane)"
5000,2020-12-27 01:44:59,kkt8xs,"I agree about posting in the main sub,. This is  huge info and am already worried  about the season... maybe producers do this on purpose? kind of knowing that some info can come to light during filming and we can get a second Jed? if so, thats bad."
5001,2020-12-27 00:59:57,kkt8xs,"I agree but by that time they'll probably be stanning her. Some people will probably make excuses for her anyway but at least if people know from jump...I don't know, maybe I'm being too optimistic lol"
5002,2021-01-05 21:37:38,kkt8xs, tbh the main sub’s response to her & that tiktok makes me much less inclined to post this there. I think there’s a lot of people choosing to ignore this stuff bc of the spoilers :/
5003,2020-12-27 02:54:40,kkt8xs,That part
5004,2020-12-27 16:04:35,kkt8xs,"I cannot begin to imagine what that experience is like and I’m sorry.  

I don’t know exactly how to say this so please be patient with me but I’ve been thinking more and more about what an all BIPOC bachelor would look like and if there would be a way to do it that wasn’t fetishizing or a parody of the community.  It was pointed out to me, as it is now we’re still seeing the “best of” black people, but I would love to see a show in which the people of colour didn’t have to live up to “white expectations” of behaviour.  Why isn’t Ivan’s brother worthy of a fairytale love story?

I am bored of my skin colour and our waspy-ass hetero-normative interactions.

Edit: spelling"
5005,2020-12-27 02:10:03,kkt8xs,"Exactly. I have ONE white friend from Forsyth County (out of probably hundreds of white people I know from the area) who was outspoken in her support of BLM this year.

ETA: I have other friends from the area who were and are outspoken in support of BLM, but they’re not white."
5006,2020-12-27 05:25:13,kkt8xs,Will Matt be comfortable walking around that town though especially in these times? I would be scared if i was him no matter how comfortable he is around those types of folks IMO.
5007,2020-12-27 05:43:24,kkt8xs,I don’t think it’s a stretch at all to say he’s comfortable with white folks with racist views. He’s moving to Jupiter FL.
5008,2020-12-27 02:17:42,kkt8xs,"I agree completely, and obviously the intent of my post is not what matters, the impact is. I will definitely edit a couple of things when I am back on my laptop & off mobile."
5009,2020-12-27 19:36:05,kkt8xs,I believe thats her brother and his friend. Rachael has been bar hopping and he has been all over with everybody. So they are no different lol.
5010,2020-12-28 16:01:50,kkt8xs,"Just to add because I just looked this up: they think Hillary Clinton, George Soros and other Democrats are trafficking kids to feed them to Satan. Seriously. Absolutely nuts. And terrifying how mainstream Q shit is becoming."
5011,2020-12-28 01:10:41,kkt8xs,o interesting
5012,2020-12-27 05:28:23,kkt8xs,I don't know. There's no hometowns this aeason but that would have been interesting to watch.
5013,2020-12-27 20:53:42,kkt8xs,"She could very well be F1 but historically, the F1 in recent times have always been low key post show. Even as messy as Hannah’s season was, in the BachBette forum, they were able to sleuth Jed was F1 before RS corrected his spoiler because Tyler was all over the place and could not be placed on SHV. Some folks on the BachBette forum are saying that Matt likely had an SHV already mid week of  Dec 13th for a few days, apparently he was MIA on SM from Dec 15th to Dec 17th. If that is correct, then he his due for another SHV next week likely after he finishes press for the season premiere based on the 3 weeks max schedule in beetwen SHVs as confirmed by previous leads. So if Rachael is the only girl MIA at the same time, then I will accept she is the F1. On the other hand, I am not even convinced yet that Matt has had an SHV yet and if he continues to be be accounted for hanging with his friends all over the place, then no way he ended up with anyone but then I doubt TPTB will let that fly for their first black bachelor lol."
5014,2021-01-17 13:55:18,kkt8xs,sidebar your username is amazing
5015,2020-12-28 18:10:41,kkt8xs,Girl you got all the sources lol. I just made an account for bachbatte  lol
5016,2021-01-05 09:14:30,kkt8xs,I still think Bri won or Michelle.😂😂
5017,2021-01-17 14:53:15,kkt8xs,"Haha thank you!! I was a big teen mom fan when I joined reddit, now it’s too stressful to watch 😭"
5018,2020-12-26 20:38:56,kkpbsh,I will always miss Josh Nichols fan reactions to every Oprah episode. God bless that boy!
5019,2020-12-26 20:38:48,kkpbsh,"Oprah is ass lmao, sorry to ruin this for you"
5020,2020-12-26 21:59:40,kkpbsh,Im going with Favorite Things and Remembering Your Spirit but so many more...
5021,2020-12-26 21:58:08,kkpbsh,"Yes, clearly her success was just an accident."
5022,2020-12-26 09:19:52,kkfss8,"Which decade Oprah we talking about?

Hell man, in my best Oprah impression, “you get some dick, and you get some dick!”"
5023,2020-12-26 09:21:55,kkfss8,"Involved in the sense that she's running the camera? Sure.

Who's the third?"
5024,2020-12-26 09:19:29,kkfss8,Call Gail King
5025,2020-12-26 09:27:07,kkfss8,Long as I get a car
5026,2020-12-26 09:19:26,kkfspo,0 because she has money.
5027,2020-12-26 09:57:13,kkfspo,It should take one. But only if you've got a good solid swing and can get past her security.
5028,2020-12-26 09:21:16,kkfspo,She is gay so you’re going to have to ruffi her
5029,2020-12-26 09:23:05,kkfspo,So 1. But not for me
